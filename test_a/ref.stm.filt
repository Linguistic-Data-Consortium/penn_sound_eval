Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 404.428 407.771 FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL EVEN THE STRANGE THE LIGHT FRAGMENTS
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 408.39 421.069 BUT I WORKED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT SHOWED THE VARIANT SYSTEM SO ALL THOSE CROSSES THAT YOU SAW EMBROIDERED PRECEDE WORDS AND THE WORDS CORRESPOND TO OTHER WORDS PRECEDED BY A CROSS WITHIN THE POEM
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 421.513 425.603 SO {there's / there is / there has} THIS RATHER INTENSE SYSTEM OF

Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 442.953 452.782 LIKE THE LINES LIKE 'TIS IS 'TIS AS IF OUR SOULS ABSCONDED SUDDENLY AND THE VARIANT IS SOULS AND THE VARIANTS BELOW THE POEM ARE WORLD SELVES AND SUN

Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 613.832 618.47 WONDERING WHETHER THE OTHER MIGHT NOT BE BETTER FOR THE JOB AND EVEN EXPRESSING DOUBT
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 618.625 621.865 THAT HE HIMSELF HAD ANY RIGHTS IN THIS MATTER PERHAPS
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 622.132 622.867 HE CHUCKLED
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 623.14 624.869 i am NOT REALLY HERE AT ALL
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 626.2 627.619 HE WAS PUSHED FORWARD THOUGH
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 628.359 630.68 BUT WHEN HE APPROACHED THE LADY SHE TOLD HIM
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 631.325 632.9 SHE MIGHT ONLY YIELD HERSELF
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 1.73 3.984 I THOUGHT TO GO TO CHICAGO RIGHT AWAY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 4.115 5.261 AND SUDDENLY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 5.643 6.762 INEXPLICABLY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 7.053 8.359 MY WILL FAILED ME
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 9.63 13.91 WAS IT THAT {i had / i would} GOTTEN SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING ALL BY MYSELF DURING THE PAST FOUR MONTHS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 14.1 15.51 THAT I NEEDED NO ONE ELSE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 16.68 19.77 AN OLDER WOMAN A SECOND COUSIN TOOK ME IN HAND
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 20.41 25.74 BUT I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY DETACHMENT BY SEEING THAT IT WAS ONLY MY MENTAL IMAGE OF HER THAT WAS MAKING LOVE TO ME
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 26.17 27.801 what ever OUR BODIES WERE UP TO
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 29.55 36.001 MEANWHILE I KEPT A CLOSE WATCH ON THAT LADDER ACTIVITY THINKING HOW NOW I WOULD BE ABLE TO SATISFY HILDA WHEN NEXT WE MET
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 36.65 39.205 THE KNOWLEDGE how ever ACQUIRED IS POWER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 41.77 44.72 I MUST CONFESS MY FEELINGS TOWARDS HILDA WERE NOT UNMIXED
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 44.97 47.069 AT TIMES I WOULD DECIDE TO BANISH HER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 47.66 49.27 FOR SHE DESERVED NOTHING ELSE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 50.04 54.57 BUT THEN I WOULD SEE THAT SHE WAS ALREADY BANISHED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 58.512 64.02 WELL THE FIRST THING I HAD TO CONFRONT WAS HOW TO EXTRICATE MYSELF FROM THE SECOND COUSIN'S CLUTCHES
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 64.735 65.939 {that's / that is / that has} ANOTHER STORY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 66.63 70.07 A STORY ALL IN ITSELF AND ONE REALLY VERY MUCH LIKE THIS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 70.71 72.343 SO I do not HAVE TO TELL IT HERE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 79.32 80.63 A YEAR HAD PASSED
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 80.8 85.199 AND HILDA HAD GROWN SOME FOUR OR FIVE INCHES SO THAT SHE WAS NOW SIX FEET TALL
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 86.52 91.351 HER WRISTS WHICH HAD BEEN LONG WITH A KIND OF VULNERABILITY I FOUND VERY ATTRACTIVE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 91.536 92.569 WERE NOW BONY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 92.81 94.426 AS THOUGH {she had / she would} BEEN HUNG FROM A BEAM
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 96.0 99.776 HER FACE DEPRIVED OF ITS PREVIOUS BLOOM WAS LONG AND SALLOW
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 100.03 101.576 IN SHORT I THOUGHT HER UGLY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 102.55 105.88 PITIFULLY SO ALTHOUGH WHEN SHE SPOKE THE VOICE WAS THE SAME
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 106.03 108.458 AND I WAS GLAD TO FEEL THE PAIN OF THAT SURVIVAL
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 110.053 114.195 HER PLACE WAS BY NO MEANS THE PALACE SHE HAD CAUSED ME TO INFER SHE CAME FROM
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 114.77 117.332 I HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT ON A COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 117.83 122.469 BUT BY NOW I KNEW THIS KIND OF EVASION OF THE REALITIES OF {one's / one is / one was / one has} CIRCUMSTANCE WAS wide spread
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 122.872 125.04 AND {i had / i would} EVEN BEGUN TO SLIP INTO IT MYSELF
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 128.72 131.46 NEXT DAY WHEN HER PARENTS WERE AT WORK HILDA
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 131.645 134.53 WHO HAD TAKEN THE MORNING OFF SAT WITH ME IN THE KITCHEN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 135.13 138.08 WHILE HER BOYFRIEND RACED HIS MOTORBIKE UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 138.62 141.403 LOOKING UP AT THE WINDOW FROM TIME TO TIME SNEAKILY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 141.66 144.125 I CAUGHT HIS GLANCE ONCE WHEN I WAS LOOKING DOWN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 145.495 147.032 HOW HILDA MUST HAVE FELT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 148.02 151.72 SHE HAD RETURNED TO A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND NOW HERE I WAS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 152.15 155.7 THE LIVING PROOF OF A WILL SHE would not BE LIKELY TO MEET MANY MORE TIMES
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 156.16 157.991 IN THE CORNER SHE HAD SETTLED FOR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 158.86 161.74 FOR IT WAS CLEAR TO ME NOW THAT ALL WAS OVER BETWEEN {us / u. s.}
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 162.775 164.18 LISTENING TO HER TALK
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 164.58 167.9 I BEGAN TO DESPISE THE PERSON I HAD BEEN THE YEAR BEFORE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 169.36 171.25 STILL I HAD THE WILL TO STAY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 171.47 175.46 BUT THE WILL TO LEAVE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES OFFERED MORE POSSIBILITIES
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 175.78 178.069 AND SO I BOWED GRACEFULLY TO THE INEVITABLE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 180.3 183.31 WHEN I GOT UP TO GO TEARS DID COME TO HER EYES
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 183.765 185.514 THAT MOMENT I REMEMBER STILL
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 186.73 193.195 AND I recogniseD IMMEDIATELY A FEELING TO BE STORED UP AGAINST THE EASE IF NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF TIMES TO COME
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 194.02 195.592 MANY TIMES IN THE FUTURE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 196.05 199.386 I WAS TO CONJURE THAT FAREWELL WHEN I WAS FILLED WITH DESPAIR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 199.98 202.23 AND OFTEN IT SUFFICED TO TIP THE BALANCE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 202.57 206.51 SO THAT IT COULD BE THOUGHT TO HAVE CAUSED SEVERAL DESTRUCTIVE RAGES OVER THE YEARS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 207.98 209.998 BUT {it's / it is / it has} ALL WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE NOW
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 210.82 212.707 HARDLY WORTH THE TROUBLE OF TELLING
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 213.03 216.22 AND {it's / it is / it has} PAST TIME ALREADY TO THINK THAT I HAVE TOLD IT POORLY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 216.6 218.377 AND TO SEE THAT LIKE IT OR NOT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 218.837 220.923 {there's / there is / there has} NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT THAT EITHER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 222.63 224.68 YES IT MIGHT HAVE ALL BEEN OTHERWISE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 225.12 229.352 AND YET FOR WHAT IT HAS TO SAY ABOUT THE HUMAN WILL IN ONE OF ITS MANIFESTATIONS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 229.737 232.002 I would not CHANGE ONE MOMENT OF THE MISERY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 232.44 235.278 FOR AN EASIER WAY IS NOT NECESSARILY A BETTER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 236.51 239.95 AND I BELIEVE I CAN SPEAK NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR HILDA
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 240.7 243.03 WHO FOUND OUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO MEET HER MATCH
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 243.43 245.01 A MAN WHO SCORNED TO TAKE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 245.17 247.279 EITHER NO OR YES FOR AN ANSWER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 253.42 254.207 o. k.
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 260.893 265.3 NOW TH THESE ARE A SERIES OF SHORT PIECES WITH A GENERAL TITLE OF TIGHT CORNERS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 267.349 267.757
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 273.114 275.926 HAVE I BEEN READING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MINUTES FEELS LIKE IT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 276.367 277.128 {what's / what is / what has / what does} THE TIME

Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 291.7 295.62 THE BOY ELBOWS BENT SUPPORTS HIMSELF WITH HIS HANDS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 296.18 297.452 HIS BODY PRONE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 298.12 302.58 SO THAT HIS FACE MAY APPROACH THE SURFACE OF THIS SMALL POND FROM WHICH HE DRINKS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 303.782 305.624 AT HIS BACK THE LANE GOES ON
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 305.93 307.305 AND THE SHEEP GO WITH IT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 307.87 311.053 THE BLACK DOG AT THEIR BACK POSSIBLY A REMINDER OF THE ARTIST
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 311.861 312.978 OR {one's / one is / one was / one has} SELF
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 314.06 317.699 FURTHER ON ONE WANTS TO SAY THOUGH IN ANOTHER SENSE {it's / it is / it has} HIGHER UP
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 318.39 321.849 THE LANE CROOKS OUT OF THE SHADE AND FINDS AN OPEN MEADOW
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 322.58 325.85 FROM WHERE THERE MUST BE A BETTER VIEW OF THAT SQUAT CHURCH TOWER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 327.2 328.335 BUT THE CLOUDS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 329.25 331.119 THE CLOUDS ARE MORE SURELY THE POINT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 331.89 334.339 SUCH CLOUDS AS ARE NO LONGER TO BE SEEN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 335.293 338.026 A RHYTHM OF CONTRACTION WOULD PULL ONE IN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 338.32 339.82 DEEPER INTO ITSELF
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 340.38 342.23 BEFORE THAT OPEN SPACE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 342.62 343.968 MEADOW AND SKY
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 344.564 345.8 IS GRANTED ONE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 352.71 355.495 THESE ARE VERY LOOSELY SEQUENTIAL AND {it's / it is / it has}
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 357.65 360.046 {it's / it is / it has} HAPPIEST FOR ME IF I JUST MAKE UP
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 360.49 362.278 A DIFFERENT WAY THROUGH IT EACH TIME
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 362.885 363.475 SO
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 365.13 367.924 THE PAUSE IS ONLY WHILE THE EYE SELECTS SOMETHING TO DO
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 368.64 371.262 WHILE THEY WATCH THE CAT WHILE THEY WATCH
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 371.61 374.94 WHILE THEY WATCH THE CAT STALKS UP THE PATH TO THE FRONT DOOR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 375.7 378.43 RAISES ITSELF BY PUTTING ITS FRONT PAWS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 378.64 380.832 AS HIGH AS IT CAN REACH AGAINST THE DOOR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 381.24 383.561 AND THEN RESTING ON ITS LEFT FOREFOOT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 384.17 388.711 IT RAISES ITS RIGHT SO THAT THE KNOCKER IS MOVED OUT UNTIL THE ARC OF THE PAW
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 388.96 390.95 FALLS BELOW THE ARC THE KNOCKER MAKES
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 391.28 394.829 AND THUS THE KNOCKER FALLS BACK AGAINST THE METAL INSET IN THE DOOR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 395.37 396.57 AND AS THEY WATCH
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 396.69 397.93 THE DOOR OPENS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 398.118 399.55 AND THE CAT SLIPS IN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 399.86 401.65 AS A {woman's / woman is / woman has} FACE APPEARS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 402.055 403.329 PEERING INTO THE STREET
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 414.74 418.07 THE TWO MEN HAVE BEEN WALKING FOR A LONG TIME ONE THINKS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 418.6 420.286 THOUGH PERHAPS NO MORE THAN AN HOUR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 421.07 427.093 {it's / it is / it has} NOW BECOMING OBVIOUS THAT HE HAS CHOSEN THE LESS TRAVELED OF TWO HIGHWAYS OUT OF TOWN IN THE DIRECTION HE AND HIS FRIEND WANT TO GO
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 428.351 430.3 HIS FRIEND WAS RIGHT AND HE WAS WRONG
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 431.3 435.49 THEY RESOLVE TO TAKE THE CUTOFF THEY ARE NOW APPROACHING AND TO WALK ITS LENGTH
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 435.94 437.7 IF NO FARM TRUCK COMES ALONG
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 438.09 439.651 UNTIL THE OTHER HIGHWAY IS REACHED
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 440.36 441.809 THE HEAT IS CONSIDERABLE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 442.02 443.567 IT IS EARLY AFTERNOON
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 443.98 447.481 ON EITHER HAND HUGE FIELDS OF WHEAT FIND NO WIND TO STIR THEM
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 448.52 450.601 THE ONLY FOOD THEY HAVE IS A CHOCOLATE BAR
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 451.51 455.193 THE TIME COMES TO EAT IT AND ONE UNSLINGS THE PACK AND THEY TAKE IT OUT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 0.122 3.098 WHEN THE BUNK SHOOK SO HARD STUFF FELL FROM THE CEILING
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 3.714 5.319 HE SAW WHOSE HAND IT WAS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 6.191 12.181 BUT THE WOMAN HAD PULLED HIM SO STRONGLY INTO HER FRONT THAT A BUTTON OF HER DRESS HAD DUG IN HIS CHEEK ABOVE THE BONE
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 12.489 13.902 AND THAT PAIN TOOK OVER
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 16.196 17.09 BUT AFTER THAT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 19.013 19.944 BUT AFTER THAT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 21.074 22.471 HE SAW THE HAND OFTEN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 23.113 25.093 LOOKING WHERE IT WAS CUT THROUGH
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 26.404 28.553 JUST LIKE THE MEAT IN THE BUTCHER'S
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 30.081 32.013 THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DO WITH IT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 32.697 35.556 HE PICKED IT UP AND FELT IT FROM OUTSIDE AND THEN FROM IN
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 36.078 37.189 AS THOUGH HE WORE IT
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 37.482 38.593 ON HIS WRIST
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 39.05 40.479 LIKE HIS OWN HANDS
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 42.931 46.77 HE STILL SEARCHED FOR THE JAGGED METALS BUT NOW HIS FATHER HAD TOLD HIM

DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 271.41 283.407 THE LANGUAGE IS OFTEN INTIMATE THE IMAGES VOLUPTUOUS AND OFTEN EXOTIC THE ENERGY SEEMINGLY ENDLESS TO THE POINT USUALLY REASSURING AND FLATTERING WITH JUST ENOUGH ELUSIVE CONNECTIONS TO MAKE {us / u. s.} WANT TO PUT OUT THE TIME AND ENERGY TO MAKE OURSELVES AS ATTRACTIVELY INTELLIGENT
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 283.63 287.161 AND PERCEPTIVE AND EXPERIENCED AND IN THE KNOW AS THE POEMS ASSUME WE ARE
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 288.2 290.964 HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT AN AUDIENCE THAT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS HE WAS

DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 313.71 323.13 HE HELPED ME realise THAT THE REASON I WROTE POEMS WAS OFTEN SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RUSH THE FEELING THAT ACCOMPANIED THE WRITING OF THE POEM ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SEEMED TO BE COMING OUT GOOD could not BE DUPLICATED ANYWHERE ELSE
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 323.52 332.868 IT was not A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANYTHING ELSE GOING TO BED WITH SOMEONE BEAUTIFUL AND TOUGH OR EATING A DELICIOUS AND TOTALLY SATISFYING MEAL OR OUTWITTING A HORRIBLY ABUSIVE COMPETITIVE CREEP IN A CONVERSATION
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A b 333.23 342.938 AND IT was not A GRUELING ACT OF ANGUISH AND PAIN GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ALL THE CRABBED SECRETS OF THE PSYCHE AND EXPOSING TO THEM TO THE WELLorganiseD AND SYSTEMATIC SCRUTINY OF SOME POETIC FORM OR STRATEGY NO

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 232.891 234.536 WITH MY FRIEND C A CONRAD
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 235.735 242.473 OUR EXERCISE WAS BASED ON DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY CELLIST ARTHUR RUSSELL'S MASTERPIECE WORLD OF ECHO
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 243.37 248.084 IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE RUSSELL'S WORLD OF ECHO FOR ANYONE WHO has not HEARD IT BEFORE
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 248.854 257.421 IT HAS A RARE SPIRITUAL QUALITY WHICH ISSUES FROM RUSSELL'S SONGWRITING VOICE AND CELLO PLAYING BUT ALSO FROM THE PRODUCTION VALUES OF THE ALBUM
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 258.15 267.342 PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE FROM TIM {lawrence's / lawrence is / lawrence has} BIOGRAPHY OF RUSSELL HOLD ONTO YOUR DREAMS MAKES PALPABLE RUSSELL'S SUBTLE ACCIDENTAL STUDIO PROCESSES
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 269.202 273.875 DURING THESE SESSIONS IT BECAME STANDARD FOR ARTHUR TO SPLICE TOGETHER SEPARATE TAPES
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 274.424 282.073 AND HE WOULD REGULARLY GRAB A TRACK FROM ONE TAPE AND FLY IT INTO THE MULTITRACK OF ANOTHER WHILE HIS ONLOOKING ENGINEER TRIED TO STAY CALM

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 307.814 313.63 AT ONE POINT CONRAD TOLD ME THAT HE USED THE ALBUM TO HEAL A KNEE INJURY THAT HE HAD SUFFERED
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 314.258 325.872 RUSSELL WAS TRAINED FOREMOST AS A MUSICIAN AND ONLY AFTERWARDS AS A BUDDHIST SO THE HEALING POWERS OF HIS MUSIC I CAN ONLY IMAGINE COME FROM THE CONFLUENCE OF THESE TWO DISCIPLINES
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 327.022 336.341 FOR OUR EXERCISE CONRAD AND I DECIDED TO HAVE RUSSELL'S ALBUM PLAYING ON FOUR DIFFERENT STEREOS THROUGHOUT THE FIVE STORY HOUSE FOR A TWELVE HOUR DURATION
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 336.814 342.518 TWELVE HOURS IS A LONG TIME TO DO ANYTHING AND ESPECIALLY TO LISTEN TO AN ALBUM TRIPLY ON REPEAT
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 343.65 346.845 AMONG THE CONSTRAINTS I RECALL IMPOSING ON MYSELF
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 347.3 348.981 MANY HAD TO DO WITH MEMORY
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 349.881 353.115 TRYING TO FORGET THE LAST LINE I HAD WRITTEN BEFORE CONTINUING
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 353.598 357.409 INTERRUPTING MYSELF MID LINE THEN PICKING UP WITH THE LINE AGAIN
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 357.937 363.161 THESE EXERCISES IN INTENTION AND DISTRACTION I FELT WERE TRUE TO RUSSELL'S MUSIC
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 363.673 370.225 SO WAS A CERTAIN CIRCULARITY THAT THE EXERCISES WERE TRYING TO INDUCE AMIDST INTERRUPTION AND DISJUNCTION
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 372.398 379.822 WE ALSO SPENT MUCH OF THE NINE HOURS IMPROVISING LINES WITH A SET OF BOOKS I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME FROM NEW YORK CITY TO PHILADELPHIA

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 20.516 29.902 AND {there's / there is / there has} A KIND OF MORAL SUPERIORITY IN THIS CRITIQUE THAT SUPPOSES THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DIDACTIC YOU KNOW WE WE SHOULD TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO NOT HAVE PLEASURE WITH MASS CULTURE
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 30.367 30.998 WHY
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 31.394 59.814 YOU KNOW THAT {that's / that is / that has} NOT does not GET AT THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IT does not GET AT WHAT IS WHAT IS A PROBLEM HERE SO AND IT TAKES FOR GRANTED THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE {who's / who is / who has} INTELLECTUAL {they are / they were} OUTSIDE THE CULTURE {they are / they were} SUPERIOR TO IT RIGHT ARTISTS ART FOR THEM IS OUTSIDE THE IDEOLOGIES RIGHT RESISTANCE YOU KNOW THE THE RESISTANCE IS OUR JOB YOU KNOW WE ARE THE MORAL CONSCIENCE OF THE CULTURE AND IF YOU CHALLENGE THIS AS I HAVE DONE ON MANY O OCCASIONS AND I I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO PUT FORWARD TO REPLACE RESISTANCE
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 60.211 77.226 RESISTANCE SAID A CRITIC RECENTLY TO ME WHEN I GAVE A TALK IN NEW YORK RESISTANCE WILL DIE HARD AND HE NARROWED HIS EYES AS HE SAID IT AND HE HUNCHED UP HIS SHOULDERS IN A KIND OF DEFENSIVE WAY AND THEY WERE VERY WELL FED AND VERY WELL PADDED SHOULDERS IN A BUTTER SOFT LAMB LEATHER COAT
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 77.811 83.885 AND I THOUGH YES RESISTANCE WILL DIE HARD ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE WITH CAREER INVESTMENTS IN ITS STOCK
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 86.621 90.644 SO AS I WAS WRITING THIS PIECE ALONG CAME A PRESS RELEASE FROM JOY GARNETT
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 91.13 96.19 AND IT CAME THROUGH THE e. mail AND IT B IT HAD IN IT THIS BRAND NEW PAINTING THAT SHE SENT
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 96.633 108.815 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SO WET IT EVEN LOOKED WET ON THE SCREEN IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF WONDERFUL AND THE PRESS RELEASE SAID JOY GARNETT CONTINUES HER EXPLORATION OF THE MALLEABILITY OF INSTANTLY GLOBALIZED IMAGES
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 109.316 142.863 SHE SAID SHE CULLS THEM AND SHE ARCHIVES THEM SO THAT THEIR CONTEXT EVAPORATES AND I THOUGHT YES THIS IS SO INTERESTING { she's / she was / she is / she has} LIKE DOING THIS YOU KNOW REMEDIATION PROJECT AND JUST WORKING WITH THESE IMAGES AND IT FELT SO MUCH TO ME LIKE THE IMAGES IN MY BOOK OF OF REAL THINGS OF THINGS A {person's / person is / person has} OBSER OBSERVED OR PHOTOGRAPHS AND {they are / they were} SO STRIKING THAT THEY SORT OF STOP YOUR DAY AND I COULD TELL SHE WAS HAVING THAT SAME EXPERIENCE AND THAT THESE THINGS JUST COME OUT DURING IT STOPS HER AND SHE THINKS WHAT AN AMAZING IMAGE BUT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMAGE SHE HAS TO REMAKE IT SHE HAS TO REPAINT IT
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 143.843 150.742 SO AGAIN I KNOW THAT EXPERIENCE I SIT DOWN I SIT DOWN WITH IMAGES THAT COME FROM THE CULTURE AND I WANT TO DRAW THEM AGAIN
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 151.452 155.681 SO WHY IS THAT WHAT IS THAT DOING WHAT IS JOY WHAT IS JOY DOING
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 156.052 162.332 SHE ABSORBS I ABSORB WE PROCESS WE REMAKE THESE THINGS WE EXPERIENCE THE IMAGES ANEW
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 162.876 180.645 SO {they are / they were} OUTSIDE ME THIS IS NOT OUTSIDE HER {they are / they were} GRAFTED {they are / they were} SCRAPED FROM THAT SURFACE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY KIND OF THROUGH THAT PHYSICAL ACT OF MAKING YOU YOU INTERPRET SOMETHING AND YOU SOMATICIZE IT IT BECOMES PART OF YOU AND {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF SEEING THROUGH THE HAND AND SEEING THROUGH THE BODY THAT GOES ALONG
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 181.834 187.273 SO WHERE DOES JOY GARNETT GET HER IDEA OF WHAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DOING I MEAN WHAT DOES SHE THINK { she's / she was / she is / she has} DOING WHAT WHAT IS HER IDEA OF MAKING ART
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 187.654 205.093 WHAT IS IT TO MAKE YOU KNOW POETRY AND TEXT INTO A BOOK WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CREATE EX AESTHETIC EXPRESSIONS AM I REALLY DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT ANYTHING MORE SELF CONSCIOUS THAN I WAS WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE DIGGING TO CHINA DO I KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT MAKING ART THAN I DO ABOUT MAK ABOUT DIGGING A HOLE

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 195.679 197.527 I GET TO IT IN THE LINE
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 198.529 202.858 THE INTERESTING THING WHICH HAPPENED TO THIS STORY WHICH ORIGINALLY HAD A HAPPY ENDING
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 203.748 212.917 PEACH BOY GOES OUT AND HE GOES TO THE ONIGASHIMA THE ISLAND OF THE DEVILS AND HE CONQUERS THE KING OF THE DEMONS DEVILS what ever YOU CALL THEM MONSTERS

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 225.987 234.36 AND THIS FINALLY TURNED OUT THEN TO BE A POEM NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT WHICH IS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF FINDING A PROPER NAME FOR EVERYTHING
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 234.89 237.028 ANYTHING THIS IS A POEM ABOUT NAMING

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 15.061 21.703 IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN I MOVED INTO A TWO BEDROOM FAT FLAT JUST UP THE STREET FROM MY PREVIOUS RESIDENCE
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 22.221 24.001 THOUGH HERE EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 31.274 41.309 THE REASON I AT TIMES EXPERIENCE CERTAINTY THAT I STARTED THIS BOOK IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT IS THAT THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THIS NEW BEDROOM I SAW MY FIRST CONCRETE TREE
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 41.801 48.32 I WAS STRUCK BY WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN ANOMALY UNTIL I BEGAN SEEING THIS TYPE OF TREE ALL OVER THAT UNIQUE CITY

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 112.352 125.974 THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN {you are / you were} EDITING is not IT YOU MOVE TEXT AROUND YOU DELETE SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE ANTICIPATED EFFECT ON YOUR TRIAL READER YOU WRITE DOWN SOMEWHERE THAT YOU HAVE DELETED THAT THING THEN YOU PUT A QUESTION MARK BESIDE IT
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 126.612 141.069 HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I BEEN THROWN INTO CONFUSION WHEN EXPLAINING TO SOMEONE THE CUTS i have MADE THAT PERSON BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE TRIAL READER AND THAT PERSON HAS RESPONDED WITH A VIOLENT SHAKE OF THE HEAD PRESSING THE POINT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT PUT IT BACK IN
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 141.943 155.09 THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE DONE THAT MATCHES THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE RUN TO A NEARBY PARK THROWN MYSELF ON A BENCH AND FALLEN OVER WITH MY HEAD IN MY LAP MY HANDS SCRAPING THE GROUND WITH THE SMALLEST OF SMILES ON MY FACE
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 155.799 158.673 CONFUSION IS A GIFT I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 159.209 161.217 THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE SMILE
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 161.899 172.049 SIMILARLY WHEN I AM IN THE MIDST OF AN OVERWHELMING SADNESS THOSE MOODS THAT HAVE NO IDENTIFIABLE CAUSE I BEGIN TO MARVEL OVER THE ABILITY TO HAVE SUCH FEELINGS

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 183.317 185.394 BECAUSE WHAT i have WRITTEN IS BEYOND ME
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 186.442 195.496 EVENTUALLY ONE COMES TO KNOW WHAT BELONGS IN A BOOK ONE IS WRITING AND WHAT DOES NOT AND EVENTUALLY ONE CHANGES {one's / one is / one was / one has} MIND ON ALL OF THIS
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 196.531 219.419 I FINISHED THE FINAL VERSION OF THE NOVELLA AFTER THAT some time LATE SUMMER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AFTER TWO EXTENSIVE REWRITINGS AND PROBABLY TWO LESS INTENSE REWORKINGS AND COUNTLESS LINE AND PARAGRAPH EDITS PLUS TWO SHELVINGS AND ONE ALMOST UTTER SHREDDING AND THEN I RAN OUTSIDE THE RELIEF I FELT WAS TREMENDOUS THOUGH ULTIMATELY SHORT LIVED

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 237.043 247.847 BUT I DO NOT THINK I NEED TO REITERATE MY REASONS FOR BLINDING MYSELF TO THAT REALITY AS IT GOES I MOVED MANY PLACES AT FIRST THEN FINALLY SETTLED ON THIS NEW ONE
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 248.491 260.575 WHY AM I HERE I ASKED MYSELF WALKING AMONG ITS THOUSANDS OF GHOSTS I COULD NOT FIND AN ANSWER BUT IN THE INTERIM I MET A GIRL AND BECAME ENAMORED WITH HER SHE WILL BE REFERRED TO AS M

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 269.702 288.171 WE WERE IN A VERY LARGE PARK I THINK SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO SEE IF THIS PARK MIRRORED THE ONE REFERRED TO IN THE NOVEL I did not WRITE IT HERE I EXPLAINED IT TO HER SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO BELIEVE ME WELL PEOPLE WILL THINK WHAT THEY WANT IT IS THEIR RIGHT I SUPPOSE BUT AFTER THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THIS CITY

Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 247.772 250.816 BUT AT MY END OF IT IT ADDED UP TO A LOT OF CONFUSION
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 251.352 255.741 FOR INSTANCE MY FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS MARKED BY MY FIRST VISIT TO A DENTIST

Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 328.825 332.838 THAT ENTRY PROVED TO BE THE FIRST AND LAST OF THAT POSSIBILITY

Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 369.559 370.68 BUT WORSE THAN THAT
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 371.115 372.735 AND SHE RANG THE SHIFT ON ME

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 348.069 376.511 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND REALLY FASCINATING ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS THAT IT ALLOWS ME AS A READER TO WATCH EACH OF YOU AS A WRITER TACKLING A NOT EXACTLY PARALLEL BUT {it's / it is / it has} THE CLOSEST THING TO IT PROJECT IN ESS IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SPACE READING THE {other's / other is / other has} WORK AND THEN CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING TO SAY OUT OF THAT PROCESS AND I AM INTRIGUED THAT BOTH OF YOU TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 377.382 389.229 I WOULD SAY FLIRT WITH NARRATIVE IN AS THOUGH IT WERE BEHIND OR RELATED TO THE TEXT YOU PICKING THE FILM THAT I TAKE IT HAS NOT EVER SEEN
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 389.927 391.456 EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW I
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 391.268 398.126 WHICH IS SO SYMMETRICAL SINCE THE FILMMAKER HAS ALSO NOT SEEN THE FILM THAT HIS FILM WAS BASED ON

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 397.214 420.499 AND AND I AND I THINK DAVID DOES THAT AS WELL SUGGESTING A A NARRATIVE HE NEVER SPELLS OUT WITH PUNS AND MERIT AND SYMMETRIES AND AND AND N AND ACTUALLY NEVER BRINGING IT TO THE SURFACE BUT THEN he will BE BACK TO IT ON ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WHICH ACTUALLY SEEMS CLOSER TO THE RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR TEXT ACTUALLY AND ITS ITS RELATIONSHIP AND i am VERY INTRIGUED IN THE KIND OF PARALLELISM

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 215.603 226.448 I THINK THIS IS DONE AND CAN BE DONE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN NEW WAYS BY READING AND WRITING POETRY WHAT MAKES {us / u. s.} WHAT WE ARE IS DETERMINED BY WHAT MAKES {us / u. s.} SEE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 226.799 235.079 ON A SOCIAL LEVEL THE GRADUAL ASSERTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IS DETERMINED IN PART BY THE VALUE THAT THE SOCIETY PLACES ON THE INDIVIDUAL
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 235.426 243.084 THIS VALUE NOT ONLY DETERMINES WHAT A SOCIETY CAN DO TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE TO SOCIETY

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 248.656 253.259 ON THE OTHER HAND CAN AN INDIVIDUAL SHED SOCIETY AND THEREBY TRANSFORM IT
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 254.75 266.512 THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALSO FOSTERED BY THE CONCEPT OF GENIUS IT MAY BE THAT GENIUS IS FOSTERED BY A MUTATION OF A {society's / society is / society has} ILLS WITH ITS STRENGTHS
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 266.908 272.786 GENIUS HAS A WAY OF AFFECTING SOCIETY DEEPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS ASL ALWAYS THE PRODUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 273.116 281.169 ANOTHER ASPECT OF GENIUS IS THAT IT IS AN IDEA THAT RETURNS TO ALL INDIVIDUALS OF VALUE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 295.646 310.524 SOCIETY IS TEMPTED TO IMITATE THE POWERFUL MACHINE BY MAKING ITS MEMBERS CONFORM TO THEIR WAYS TO PRODUCING SO UNIFORMLY OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL SOON realiseS THE VALUE IN LEARNING WHAT ARE THE ASPECTS OF NON RES REPRODUCIBILITY WHICH ARE A VALUE

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 154.029 161.962 IN SUCH A CASE A SHIFT OCCURS IN THE {speaker's / speaker is / speaker has} ATTENTION FROM THE REFERENT OF HIS SPEECH TO THE SPEECH ITSELF REFLECTION OVER {one's / one is / one was / one has} OWN WORDS
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 162.29 167.286 BUT EVEN THIS SHIFT IN VERBAL INTENTION IS IN CONDITIONED BY THE ADDRESSEE'S INTEREST

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 204.736 214.819 AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE THING THAT THE PARTITIONING OF PARAGRAPHS THE IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH AS A VITIATED DIALOGUE IS SOMETHING THAT
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 215.262 229.771 IS NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE STRATEGIES YOU SEE IN THE WORK OF DAVID BRONWICH'S ESSAY BONES MY POETRY AND OTHERS' AND DAVID ANTON WHEN HE GAVE A TALK OVER AT EIGHTIETH LANGDON STREET AND ACTUALLY DESCRIBED HIS OWN WORK IN EXACTLY OF VOLOSHINOV'S TERMS AS A VITIATED DIALOGUE
