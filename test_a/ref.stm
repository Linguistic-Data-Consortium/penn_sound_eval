Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78 A a 574.73 577.43 the fathers of the world are out of their minds
Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78 A a 578.13 579.5 getting up in unison
Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78 A a 579.9 584.826 leaving warm beds and x our cold feet past the cold bathroom
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 0.14 5.748 You know gallons and gallons of gasoline in huge tankers that are explosi  that are flying explosives
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 6.529 12.348 I mean I don't know I mean I I I  you know but they don't talk about that that  you know that  uh you know they say the
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 12.759 19.115 the food nearly didn't reach the f  uh the the troops let alone the humanitarian aid The food nearly didn't reach them for the next two days
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 19.731 25.566 So what you have is all these supplies have to go into  you know high high tech wars require high t  uh re require freight
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 27.694 38.837 But you could've  I mean I could've run a news program In the area of twenty minutes I could've produced an absolutely clear articulate example of what we knew and what we didn't know very clearly And I said Now go to sleep people and wait for something to happen
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A b 38.924 39.696 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 41.052 42.478 You know it would've been the end of the program
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 42.959 45.979 and not enough s  I mean it wouldn't be enough advertisement really I mean but
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 46.442 51.623 uh uh when I left it on more than fifteen minutes I had to turn it off because I heard this they were recycling the same bullshit
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 54.911 57.574 Now that's not a glut of information
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 58.287 60.243 It's a glut of pseudo information
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 62.129 63.485 mixed with information
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 64.349 69.454 information but information is a novelty i i It introduces a novelty into the structure the unexpected
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 69.997 72.666 uh And the unexpected of course was the geurrilla war
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 73.017 81.541 which opened up o on our flank Although in classical warfare texts they always say Worry about that if you're going to s  have a long  single long line
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 82.495 83.77 These guys didn't worry about it
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 85.337 93.882 In fact they were afraid to say that it might've been a misjudgment I notice when the when the newscasters talk they say Well some people might say that it was a misjudgment of the military but we're not sure
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 95.845 97.957 The  I mean that's literally what they said
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 98.949 105.951 I mean there's no textbook in mili in in military operations that doesn't refer to the dangers of exposing er ex of exposing a long flank
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 105.594 106.237 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 107.144 108.862 I mean it's ancient military lore
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 109.31 113.227 The Chinese knew it  the Ancient Chinese knew it the Indians who played shatranj knew it
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 115.301 118.359 Don't let yourself get exposed on a flank You can be cut off
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 121.377 124.148 So I don't know I mean I  in that sense I I think that
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 124.926 126.666 it takes a good deal of precision
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 127.511 129.03 and careful thinking
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 129.435 131.11 to be able to get somewhere
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 131.536 133.017 And what I do is think
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 134.215 135.538 Have mind will travel
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A b 135.762 136.497 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 136.399 138.804 I'll think as well as I can
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 139.862 140.311 and
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 141.443 143.004 I take pleasure in thinking
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 145.209 149.409 I take pleasure in trying to figure out what's happening in  to to myself to the world
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 149.755 151.927 and I think that's part of the pleasure of poetry
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 153.075 155.863 It's the pleasure of the abil  of pleasure of thinking and
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 156.675 160.387 and not locking yourself in Now it's not the pleasure of reading an Anthony Hecht poem
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 161.288 172.683 about which I have no no no  I don't have any terrifying feelings that they're terrible but if you want to write Robert Browning uh dramatic monologues and and update them slightly that's what you're going to get It's okay
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 173.616 180.867 Has dramatic  it has certain dramatic cynical character that you could say there's a little frisson that it produces at the end usually or at somewhere in the middle of it
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 181.354 182.229 Great alright
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 183.923 189.555 It's okay I mean it doesn't bother me I I I have  I I I don't  but I don't  not interested in that I mean that's not
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 190.196 197.659 that's not an artwork from my point of view Or if it is it's a sort of subsidiary artwork The school of Iowa produces something like a Diet Coke

Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 297.388 302.142 Okay um I was thinking about something you said a little earlier that information is novelty
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 302.598 307.871 And um I was thinking of  and something I was  talking about was how the  how you're talking s 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 308.271 315.31 um the thing I think of is fugues How you bring up a theme and you develop the theme and then later um the themes maybe they change a little bit or
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 315.328 319.412 maybe you move them And I was thinking if you could talk like um
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 319.763 324.621  one kind of how how you how you manage that as you work I mean what's
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 324.999 327.133 what goes on through your head as you do that
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A g 327.569 331.534 Is  uh do you think of it in terms of of like managing themes
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 332.496 333.652 I don't now
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 334.144 334.668 uh
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 335.127 336.337 When I was writing
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 337.108 338.021 in a uh
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 338.407 340.498 um more procedural poetry
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 341.423 345.47 uh i I actually  in in the book called Definitions
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 346.408 349.854 the poems called Definitions Fermenting was constructed to be a fugue
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 350.864 353.527 uh and it was constructed specifically
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 354.04 359.581 uh on the structu  it was built entirely on the structure of a fugue There's a there's a wh  set of themes
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 360.002 361.52 that come up uh
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 362.404 371.902 one of this was this whole thing called  uh where I took a definition from an insurance book I I I saw it  as I said my lack of understanding was always one of the things that got to me 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A b 371.537 372.694 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 372.417 376.863 And uh I had been trying to r  deal  address a loss of a
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 377.528 383.808 of a dear friend who died very young and this is many years later because I tried it once before and I hadn't been able to do it
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 384.478 390.235 And uh I was living in in uh in a corner of the Bronx near the Whitestone Bridge since you had a good library
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 390.867 392.461 It mostly was filled with Catholic
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 392.847 397.79 uh Catholic philosophical texts which was rather nice because they had the journals of Simon Weil
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 398.458 403.846 So uh  but anyway I found a  an insurance manual I figured they would know what value is
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 405.367 418.863 uh and what loss was At least they would know what loss was They might not know what value was So it  I found a phra  I I went to him and I found in the insurance book this Loss is an unintentional decline in or disappearance of a value arising from a contingency
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A b 408.425 409.5 
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 420.009 429.918 And I'm thinking that's fine but I don't know what a value is so I went to the dictionary and I found out what a value was and it says  and that that comes from the the particular dictionary I was looking at
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 430.651 444.739 So uh then I had specifically started mediating o  meditating on you know in a way that you would by playing the themes in relation to each other uh You know uh the term fugue is a metaphor
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 445.176 449.094 but there was something like my instr  interest in what  you know what they called the stretto
Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A a 449.469 462.427 that is the bringing toget  the tightening of the distances between  uh narrowing the distances between um the mater the the the materials uh through one theme and another you narrow the harmonic distance to play them closer and closer c  uh closer
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 0.39 2.62 Because the old man had peed in his pants again
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 3.301 6.051 was there turning away from the later afternoon glare
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 6.942 8.644 as though it too could be wished away
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 9.461 10.665 Was any of this present
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 11.249 15.203 and how could this be the magic solution of what you are in now
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 15.948 18.093 whatever has held you motionless like this
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 18.53 20.183 so long through the dark season
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 20.81 23.506 until now the women come out in navy blue
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 24.291 26.468 and the worms come out of the compost to die
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 26.901 28.365 it is the end of any season
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 29.167 32.965 You reading there so accurately sitting not wanting to be disturbed
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 33.673 35.342 as you came from that holy land
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 35.779 38.594 what other signs of Earth's dependency were upon you
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 39.118 42.872 What fixed sign at the crossroads what lethargy in the avenues
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 43.428 44.86 where all is said in a whisper
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 45.529 47.28 What tone of voice among the hedges
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 47.615 49.268 what tone under the apple trees
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 50.021 51.842 Numbered land stretches away
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 52.242 53.895 and your house is built in tomorrow
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 54.444 58.366 but surely not before the examination of what is right and will be fall
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 59.312 62.337 Not before the census and the writing down of names
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 63.863 65.743 Remember you are free to wander away
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 66.137 69.006 as from other times other scenes that were taking place
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 69.542 71.557 the history of someone who came too late
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 72.302 77.834 The time is ripe now and the adage is hatching as the seasons change and tremble
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 78.512 82.99 It is finally as though that thing of monstrous interest were happening in the sky
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 83.401 85.827 but the sun is setting and prevents you from seeing it
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 86.993 89.159 Out of night the token emerges
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 89.78 92.762 its leaves like birds alighting all at once under a tree

Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 95.664 97.145 put down in weak rage
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 98.063 100.929 knowing as the brain does it can never come about
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 101.496 106.647 Not here not yesterday in the past Only in the gap of today filling itself

Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 149.611 151.988 and slowing down opens out new avenues

Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 166.288 168.233 But most of all she loved the particles
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 168.711 172.719 that transform objects of the same category into particular ones
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 173.481 176.563 each distinct within and apart from its own class

Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 180.973 182.87 only a pleasant wavering of the air
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 183.374 185.054 in which all things seem present
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 185.4 187.388 whether just past or soon to come
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 188.03 189.397 It was all invitation
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 190.137 194.486 so much the flowers outlined along the night alleys when few were visible
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 194.939 199.959 yet their story sounded louder than the hum of bug and stick noises that brought up the rear
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 200.531 203.0 trundling it along into a new fact of day
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 204.48 207.894 These were meant to be read as any salutation before getting down to business
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 208.597 209.969 but they stuck to their guns
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 210.664 213.457 and so much was their obstinacy in keeping with the rest
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 214.02 218.169 like long flashes of white birds that refused to die when day does
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 218.681 221.815 that none knew the warp which presented this major movement
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 222.199 223.501 as a firm digression
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 223.889 225.926 a plain that slowly becomes a mountain
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 227.883 235.399 So each found himself caught in a net as a fashion and all efforts to wriggle free involved him further inexorably
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 235.922 239.855 since all existed there to be told shot through from border to border
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 240.784 243.091 Here were stones that read as patches of sunlight
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 243.961 247.91 There was the story of the grandparents of the vigorous young champion
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 248.587 252.034 the lines once given to another now restored to the new speaker
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 252.781 255.903 dinners and assemblies the light in the old home
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 256.362 258.669 the secret ways the rooms fed into each other
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 259.123 261.646 but all was wariness of time watching itself
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 262.002 264.666 for nothing in the complex story grew outside
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 265.647 272.011 the greatness in the moment of telling stayed unresolved until its wealth of incident pain mixed with pleasure
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 272.569 274.589 faded in the precise moment
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 275.022 276.275 of bursting into bloom
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 276.815 278.523 its growth a static lament
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 280.16 282.866 Some stories survive the dynasty of the builders
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 283.439 285.573 but their echo was itself locked in
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 286.262 290.119 became anticipation that was only memory after all
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 290.888 292.963 for the possibilities are limited
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 293.73 297.036 It is seen at the end that the kind and good are rewarded
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 297.741 304.272 that the unjust one is doomed to burn forever around his error sadder and wiser anyway
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 305.342 309.178 Between these extremes the others muddle through like us
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 309.702 314.986 uncertain but wearing artlessly their function of minor characters who must be kept in mind
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 316.007 318.362 It is we who make this jungle and call it space
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 319.044 327.473 naming each route each serpent for the sound of the name as it clinks dully against our pleasure Indifference that is pleasure
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 328.253 332.945 And what would they be without an audience to restrict the innumerable passes and swipes
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 333.383 337.559 restored to good humor as it issues into the impervious evening air
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 338.223 341.233 So in some way although the arithmetic is incorrect
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 341.96 344.483 the balance is restored because it balances
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 344.814 345.938 knowing it prevails
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 346.445 349.509 and the man who made the same mistake twice is exonerated
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 352.157 353.883 The tomb of Stuart Merrill
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 357.451 362.86  Stuart Merrill was incidentally a nineteenth century American poet who
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 363.595 365.632 uh immigrated to France and became
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 366.412 370.016 a  one of the uh the s s  French Symbolist poets
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 370.972 374.327  It is the first soir of March

Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 378.343 387.747 Martha Hoople wanted a big gnossienne hydrangea smelling all over of Jicky for her card party The basement couldn't hold up all that wildness
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 388.439 389.877 The petit fours have left
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 391.351 392.913 Then up and spake the major
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 393.484 395.974 The New Conservatism is sitting down beside you
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 396.547 401.684 once when the bus slid out past Place Pereire I caught the lens cover reflection

Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 405.837 409.695 Otherwise in Paris why you never approved much of my pet remedies
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 410.209 415.233 I spoke once of a palliative for piles You wouldn't try or admit to trying any other
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 416.531 419.346 Now we live without or rather we get along without each other
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 420.064 425.253 each of us does live within that conundrum we don't call living both shut up and open
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 425.642 428.86 Can knowledge ever be harmful How about a mandate
Ashbery-John_01_Complete-Reading_WBAI-FM_New-York_5-14-75 A a 429.762 432.193 I think of throwing myself on the mercy of the court
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 0.384 2.682 Only immaculate darkness and thunder
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 3.621 5.069 She grabbed Sweet pea
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 5.843 7.66 I'm taking the brat to the country
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 8.573 11.7 But you can't do that he hasn't even finished his spinach
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 12.224 16.298 urged the Sea Hag looking fearfully around at the apartment
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 17.111 19.134 But Olive was already out of earshot
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 20.347 23.481 Now the apartment succumbed to a strange new hush
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 24.289 26.82 Actually it's quite pleasant here thought the Sea Hag
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 27.325 31.44 If this is all we need fear from spinach then I don't mind so much
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 32.017 34.589 Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 35.069 37.71 She scratched one dug pensively
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 38.569 41.91 But Wimpy is such a country bumpkin always burping like that
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 43.64 44.779 Minute at first
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 45.163 47.261 the thunder soon filled the apartment
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 47.857 50.957 It was domestic thunder the color of spinach
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 52.025 54.933 Popeye chuckled and scratched his balls
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 55.605 58.397 It sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 61.795 70.251 This next poem must date from about nineteen seventy four when I at last just  could no longer escape teaching and and began teaching uh
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 70.733 73.216 poetry to students at Brooklyn College
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 73.633 84.032 and found myself immediately assailed by their questions about what is poetry and why is this a poem and why do you say this isn't and uh what is poetry anyway and 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 84.607 88.16 so this called What is Poetry but the title has no
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 88.921 90.053 question mark 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 90.732 92.742 And uh I don't
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 93.185 110.351 think it was probably very helpful to the students but it was part of my finally beginning to think about what is poetry myself having done it for a long time without ever having asked myself that question And it ends as so many of my poems do or or rather  they include
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 111.084 111.749 lines of

Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 267.171 268.887 that we think of him sometimes
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 269.588 271.103 sometimes and always
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 271.628 272.856 with mixed feelings
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 276.471 277.149 Well this is a
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 277.509 281.903 fairly recent poem of the past few years Don't know exactly when
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 283.102 285.888 Called At First I Thought I Wouldn't Say Anything About It 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 286.786 298.115 and uh I can't think of anything I was thinking about when I wrote it so I won't  introduce it except uh I see it has the phrase The unruly sun obviously
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 298.794 302.12 a uh theft from John Dunne
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 305.386 307.862 At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 309.963 313.783 But then I thought keeping quiet about it might appear even ruder
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 315.21 317.679 At first I thought I had died and gone to heaven
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 318.417 322.299 But that scapegrace the unruly son informed me otherwise
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 323.984 329.232 I'm in my heavyset pants and find this occupation of beekeeper charming
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 330.233 332.352 thought I have yet to meet my first bee
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 333.681 336.328 We don't know if I get to keep the hat and veil

Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 352.047 355.648 Now I shall take a short vacation proof that I am needed here
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 356.725 359.379 Nobody wants my two cents anymore I believe
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 360.278 362.302 To some it was like skating in summer
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 362.695 366.519 a small turret perched over the lake It exploded
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 367.383 371.979 That's the way I feel about people taking me out to some nice repast
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 373.138 376.552 and afterwards you go home and go over everything that was stated
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 377.259 379.447 I prefer flowers and breathing
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 383.423 391.249 The next poem is called No Longer Very Clear and uh well it's no longer very clear to me when I wrote it or what I was thinking about when I wrote it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 391.87 393.187 However I uh
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 393.551 399.891 I could tell you that the public radio station in um in New York City WNYC
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 400.321 411.898 had a uh benefit uh concert and they asked me to contribute a poem uh which would be set to music by a number of contemporary composers or at any rate they would write music
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 412.411 415.717 suggested by it if they weren't actually setting the words
Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 416.382 418.748 And uh Philip Glass uh

Ashbery-John_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-24-99 A a 438.707 446.378 piano pieces that she says are based on and then she's going to do another one to make three but she hasn't done it yet
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 0.049 3.76 It didn't took much longer than any other poetry that I've ever
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 4.295 5.132 written It was
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 5.494 6.143 the three 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 6.688 11.148 poems were written over hm a period of about a year and a half maybe
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 11.885 14.954 I didn't quite know what I wanted to do I I thought it would be interesting to write
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 16.537 21.108 poetic prose that wasn't poetic In other words a p a a a prose poem that really
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 21.592 28.961 drew on the resources of prosiness as well as poetic sounding language and and indeed I tried to get as many different
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 29.571 30.549 tones of
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 31.169 32.444 writing and voice
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 33.049 45.26 as uh possible  I  so I guess I fairly early on imagined this work as being kind of three large oblong boxes that I was uh going to have to fill with something and I
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 45.705 49.47 didn't really know what  uh uh that was going to be a
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 50.339 57.492 and that's frequently the case when I when I begin writing I can sort of see the shape of the poem but it's just an empty outline and and
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 58.516 61.979 no idea what I'm x going to stop   going to end up
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 74.733 80.411 This is a passage from The System from in one of uh the three poems in the book Three Poems
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 81.485 98.251 I know now that I'm not longer waiting and that the previous part of my life in which I thought I was waiting and therefore only half alive was not waiting although it was tinged with expectancy but living under and into this reply which has suddenly caused everything in my world to take on new meaning
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 99.221 104.72 It is as though I had picked up the thread which I had merely mislaid and which for a long time seemed lost
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 105.281 111.069 and all because I am certain now albeit for no very good reason that it was this one and no other
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 111.634 116.394 The sadness that infected us as children and stayed on through adulthood has healed
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 116.931 121.413 and there can be no other way except this way of health we are taking silent as it is
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 121.986 131.859 But it lets us look back on those other seemingly spoiled days and reevaluate them Actually they were too well rounded Each bore its share of happiness and grief
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 132.675 135.706 and finished its tale just as twilight was descending
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 136.202 142.136 Those days are now an inseparable part of our story despite their air of immaturity and tentativeness
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 142.693 147.08 They have the freshness of early works which may be wrongly discarded later
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 147.735 149.471 Nor is today really any different
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 149.967 152.425 We are as childish as ever it turns out
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 152.831 155.046 only perhaps a little better at disguising it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 155.789 161.584 But we still want what we want when we want it and no power on earth is strong enough to deny it to us
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 162.206 165.07 But at least we see now that this is how things are
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 165.574 175.238 and so we have the sense to stop insisting every so often under the guise of some apparently unrelated activity because we think we shall be better satisfied this way
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 175.737 179.857 Underneath the discreet behavior the desire is as imperious as ever
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 180.311 184.698 But after so many postponements we now realize that a little delay won't hurt
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 185.077 188.481 and we can relax in the assurance of eventual satisfaction
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 189.258 203.022 This was the message of that day in the street when you first perceived that conventional happiness would not do for you and decided to opt for the erratic kind despite the dangers that its need for continual growth and expansion exposed it to
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 203.658 205.169 This started you on your way
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 205.569 209.004 although it often seemed as though your feet had struck roots into the ground
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 209.386 211.813 and you were doomed to grow and decay like a tree
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 212.84 218.946 Nevertheless you were aware of moving whether it was you who were moving or the landscape moving forward toward you
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 219.381 224.539 and you could remain patient with the idea of growth as long as the concept of uniqueness
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 225.061 228.983 that one and no other had shown like a star in the sky above you
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 237.472 242.796 John Ashbery reading a passage from The System from his book Three Poems
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 248.448 255.416 For the reader of Ashbery's work one initial obstacle is overcoming the expectation of a literal sequential understanding
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 257.154 273.73 Well uh it seems that uh I I think people uh bring this uh expectation to uh almost any poetry and are destined to be disappointed since I don't think this uh condition is unique to me by any chance but applies to almost any poetry that I can think of
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 274.255 275.985 It's impossible to
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 276.561 280.887 have a completely expository poem in mind
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 281.299 282.92 and then sit down and write it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 283.483 287.81 and it would be exactly as it was conceived uh All kinds of
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 288.314 290.681 strange things happen while one is writing
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 291.282 292.829 which deflect the uh
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 293.22 295.792 original intent and uh
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 296.217 300.933 my own work I guess is just a  an extreme example of letting this happen
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 301.552 305.301 To me it seems more truthful since it's a more
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 305.883 310.016 complete r reflection of of of my thought while I'm writing
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 332.26 339.9 In nineteen seventy eight composer Elliott Carter wrote an unusual work titled Syringa for mezzo soprano bass and chamber ensemble
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 340.636 343.98 The bass sings a collection of Greek texts on the legend of Orpheus
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 344.418 349.121 while the mezzo soprano simultaneously sings John Ashbery's poem called Syringa
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 349.67 354.968 Myth of Orpheus is that of the legendary singer who brings his beloved Eurydice back from death
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 355.368 361.346 an allegory about the presumed power of music an poetry to turn time back and stop irretrievable loss
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 362.434 366.02 Even before Syringa Ashbery had long admired Carter
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A b 366.742 370.929 What is it about Carter's music that the poet finds so sympathetic to his work
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 371.269 377.039 Well the fact I guess that it's so um uh complex and yet so clear at the same time
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 377.292 384.17 Why should that be good Well because I think it it uh reflects uh experience much more accurately
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 0.0 2.97 But with such precision that's it's very exciting h
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 3.253 4.163  for instance he'll
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 4.73 6.345 he'll d describe the
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 6.68 9.131 reflection of a pin on an apple
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 9.99 12.85 The shadow of a pin on an apple 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 13.066 13.753 um
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 14.353 15.315 That's uh
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 15.97 17.338  that got me  interested

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 435.6 437.749 and I never knew whether they were published or not
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Honoring-Illuminations-Translation_NYU_5-12-11 A a 438.068 439.652 For some reason my contact x

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 0.091 3.695 as the wallet trembled and bills slid in and out of it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 4.102 7.664  I want that information very much today
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 8.38 9.454 Can't have it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 9.939 11.729 and this makes me angry
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 12.558 17.467  I shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of Avignon
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 17.877 21.998 on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 22.702 26.689 I shall see  I shall at last see my complete face
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 27.338 29.365 reflected not in the water
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 29.992 33.178 but in the warm stone floor of my bridge
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 33.997 35.824 I shall keep to myself
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 36.359 39.453 I shall not repeat others' comments about me
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 42.424 43.115 Thank you

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 65.441 66.205 Portrait
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 67.251 69.952 or is it a poor trait 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 70.868 72.342 I am a parasite
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 73.085 76.398 I lived off the wings of others
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 78.835 83.429 Written in the shadows cast by the burning of the House of Lords and Commons
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 83.944 85.54 eighteen thirty five
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 85.957 88.038 by J M W Turner
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 89.312 90.938  some three parts
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 92.048 99.268 At one point in the story the rain was green and the sky was pink shot through with painterly streaks of mauve and gray
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 100.039 102.764 Everyone including the servants and maids
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 103.284 106.361 went onto the veranda and began applauding
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 106.942 108.465 It wasn't yet evening
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 109.523 115.233 Even those who were on the outside of the narrative those like us who had no place in the story
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 115.763 118.816 were invited to attend this momentous event
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 119.289 119.598 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 120.217 123.63 Along the riverbanks the fulsome reflections of flowers
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 124.129 126.702 blossomed in every imaginable hue
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 127.306 130.225 Some colors floated slowly towards the sky
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 130.753 133.799 like boats ferrying the dead to their destination
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 134.382 137.222 twisted mazes of sparks led the way
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 138.072 139.528 It was a celebration
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 140.029 142.402 an announcement of dread and joy
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 143.386 147.083 We were lost within a swirling storm of seraphic color
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 147.483 151.262 dripping with the revelations the sky had flung in our faces
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 151.949 156.234 That's when it came to our attention that the palace is on fire
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 156.714 160.227 but no one dared cross the river and approach its gates
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 160.984 162.495 This was a different story
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 163.035 164.892 its narrative promising that
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 165.232 173.142 the construction and destruction of civil order would occur naturally like the weather near the flags flying within it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 173.931 177.08 This is the story none of us were invited to attend
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 177.6 180.77 unless we already had taken up residence in its chapters
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 181.269 184.777 with its stained pages rising toward the fiery ceiling
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 185.231 188.058 the architect had told them would be blue forever
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 188.669 192.322 This is the story that did not invite intervention
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 194.232 194.875 to 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 195.448 200.406 just as there are two paintings with many witnesses huddled on the far shore
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 200.909 205.692 there are at least two stories in those who weren't invited to listen to them
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 206.238 208.435 This story happened before we met
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 209.066 216.489 No one but us remembers it now Two shadows standing beneath the stone arch a dark river flowing past
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 217.594 222.873 What does it mean to be alone with each other sharing memories no one else has
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 223.35 229.525 Or perhaps this is the story that cannot be addressed the one that started with and without our consent
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 229.889 236.326 the one we are still telling the one in which we become honorary citizens of a city not yet named
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 236.721 238.76 Inhabitants of a small city
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 239.246 240.805 a hovel in the sky
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 241.375 247.48 As it is we are spoonfuls of ashes scattered among the days' abominations
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 248.201 249.505 We'll never be sure
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 249.97 251.854 how our voices intersected
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 252.254 255.95 amidst the pillars constantly being rec  erected for
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 256.325 260.608 and against prismatic densities by which one is supposed to swear
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 260.924 262.52 lifelong allegiance
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 263.278 268.937 Such alliances seem based on a different astrology than the one guiding us through the night
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 269.604 272.0 There is another set of stars in the sky
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 272.51 274.958 and we don't know their names or their purpose
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 275.322 278.332 That is what is pulling us across the burning lake
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 279.164 282.259 This was a dream which one of us later told the other
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 282.708 290.061 or dreamed of telling the other as the difference between these two types of flying having dissolved long ago
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 290.777 292.549 Each of us lay there thinking
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 292.974 295.51 I wish I could say something about the future
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 296.008 297.276 that will come true
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 299.164 302.314 A room each of us  this is the third section last
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 303.151 306.632 A room each of us wanted to erect the story of shelter
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 307.02 311.237 against the wind that untethered us from everything we tried to hold onto
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 311.587 314.754 from concrete nodes to abstract ideas
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 315.537 318.31 Each of us needed that sha shaded plateau
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 318.796 323.001 the place where sensual asides could unfold without interruption
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 323.593 326.737 on the small shells on which we pretended to sleep
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 327.158 331.557 when vast constellations of villainous lithography prowled the land
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 331.934 334.307 looking for components to evaporate
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 334.701 336.875 into bursts of fiery laughter
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 337.209 339.393 we realized the world was porous
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 339.792 345.72 and that we were handfuls of sand trickling through its openings into the sea waiting below
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 346.501 349.032 How to hold on to ourselves and each other
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 349.481 352.412 without threatening the seedlings beneath the skin
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 353.234 356.038 In the beginning we told ourselves there was an exit
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 356.408 362.454 somewhere for us to begin making up what had never happened and in all likelihood never would
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 364.221 367.12 Later we told each  later we told each other 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 367.517 371.389 in one way or another that there was a window with a view of paradise
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 371.953 374.866 We silently agreed that the window doesn't open
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 375.26 376.796 because it was never there
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 377.227 381.238 but that the shadows of its imprint could be seen on the opposite wall
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 382.068 384.077 Some days we sit facing them
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 384.404 386.619 trying to decipher their promises
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 386.991 390.153 but more often than not we look the other way
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A a 390.547 393.035 still believing that there's something else
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 0.197 2.542 To fall at our feet like crocuses
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 3.458 5.812 All of our lives is a rebus
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 6.067 7.687 of little wooden animals
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 7.91 10.245 painted shy terrific colors
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 10.474 12.237 magnificent and horrible
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 12.579 13.611 close together
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 14.21 16.137 The message is learned the way light
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 16.376 18.885 at the edge of a beach in autumn is learned
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 19.516 21.591 The seasons are superimposed
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 22.159 24.287 In New York we have winter in August
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 24.559 27.021 as they do in Argentina and Australia
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 27.732 29.526 spring is leafy and cold
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 29.734 31.369 autumn pale and dry
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 31.948 33.832 The  and changes build up
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 33.987 34.69 forever
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 35.269 38.742 like birds released into the light of an August sky
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 39.066 40.49 falling away forever
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 40.848 43.717 to define the handful of things we know for sure
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 44.476 46.413 Followed by musical evenings
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 48.302 49.35 Yes friends
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 49.814 54.23 These clouds pulled along on invisible ropes are as you have guessed
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 54.581 56.237 merely stage machinery
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 56.976 58.426 And the funny thing is
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 58.838 60.649 it knows we know about it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 60.888 63.122 and still wants us to go on believing
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 63.386 65.832 in what it so unskillfully imitates
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 66.246 69.407 and wants to be loved not for that but for itself
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 69.956 72.09 The murky atmosphere of a park
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 72.522 75.285 tattered foliage wise old tree trunks
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 75.514 78.092 rainbow tissue paper wadded clouds
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 78.436 81.517 down near where the perspective intersects the sunset
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 82.007 84.93 So we may know we too are somehow impossible
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 85.508 87.313 formed of so many different things
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 88.286 90.621 Too many to make sense to anybody
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 91.291 93.276 We straggle on as quotients
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 93.574 95.326 hard to combine ingredients
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 95.7 96.943 and what continues
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 97.241 100.02 does so with our participation and consent
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 101.659 104.698 Try milk of tears but it is not the same
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 105.43 107.796 The dandelions will have to know why
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 108.477 110.562 And your comic dirge routine
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 110.765 113.778 will be lost on the unfolding sheaves of the wind
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 114.064 115.037 a lucky one
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 115.546 117.325 Though it will carry you too far
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 117.635 121.246 to some manageable cold open shore of sorrows
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 121.422 122.914 you expected to reach
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 123.488 124.816 then leave behind
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 125.588 127.811 Thus friend this distilled
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 128.183 130.957 dispersed musk of moving around
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 131.568 132.848 The product of leaf
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 133.183 134.855 after transparent leaf
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 135.27 137.244 of too many comings and goings
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 137.781 139.315 visitors at all hours
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 140.264 141.152 Each night
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 141.276 142.546 is trifoliate
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 142.993 144.491 strange to the touch
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 158.152 158.787 This one
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 158.989 161.445 again appropriate to the weather 
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 162.295 164.057 It's called wet casements
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 165.051 165.909 Prefaced by a
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 166.793 171.087 uh  the first sentence of Kafka's story wedding preparations in the country
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 172.282 172.843 Which is
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 173.3 177.727 when Edward Raban coming along the passage walked into the open doorway
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 178.094 179.501 he saw that it was raining
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 180.08 181.594 It was not raining much
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 184.476 186.185 The conception is interesting
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 186.658 189.628 to see as though reflected in streaming window panes
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 189.767 190.826 the look of others
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 191.213 192.621 through their own eyes
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 193.224 194.266 A digest
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 194.463 196.072 of their correct impressions

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 204.842 207.733 of some distant but not too distant era

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 217.424 218.667 Like a bottle imp
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 218.833 221.141 toward a surface which can never be approached
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 221.76 226.213 Never pierced through into the timeless energy of a present
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 226.613 229.324 which would have its own opinions on these matters
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 229.892 232.29 are an epistemological snapshot
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 232.551 235.32 of the processes that first mentioned your name
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 235.461 238.32 at some crowded cocktail party long ago
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 238.602 239.523 and someone
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 239.757 241.202 not the person addressed
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 241.372 242.234 overheard it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 242.441 244.887 and carried that name around in his wallet
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 245.302 246.058 for years
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 246.381 249.791 as the wallet crumbled and bills slid in and out of it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 250.518 253.059 I want that information very much today
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 253.722 254.489 Can't have it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 254.993 256.64 And this makes me angry
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 257.2 259.355 I shall use my anger to build a bridge
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 259.621 261.097 like that of Avignon
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 261.52 262.869 on which people may dance
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 263.109 265.184 for the feeling of dancing on a bridge
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 266.166 268.781 I shall at last see my complete face
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 269.183 270.808 reflected not in the water
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 271.063 273.705 but in the worn stone floor of my bridge
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 274.473 275.965 I shall keep to myself
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 276.476 279.029 I shall not repeat others comments about me

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 294.426 296.495 This one is called Pyrography
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 298.011 298.932 which uh

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 306.911 307.392 child
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 307.779 310.458 making pictures on wood with an electric needle
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 311.741 313.986 Out here on Cottage Grove it matters
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 314.36 316.668 The galloping wind balks at its shadow
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 316.86 320.217 The carriages are drawn forward under a sky of fumed oak
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 320.723 322.332 This is America calling
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 322.762 324.848 the mirroring of state to state
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 325.275 327.34 a voice to voice on the wires
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 327.924 329.967 The force of colloquial greetings
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 330.18 331.615 like golden pollen
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 331.944 333.945 sinking on the afternoon breeze
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 334.449 337.638 In service stares the sweet corruption thrives
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 338.518 339.703 the page of dusk
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 339.964 343.802 turns like a creaking revolving stage in Warren Ohio
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 344.943 348.109 If this is the way it is let's leave they agree
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 348.608 351.669 And soon the slow box car journey begins
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 351.977 353.559 gradually accelerating
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 353.889 356.255 until the gyrating fan of suburbs
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 356.5 358.474 enfolding the darkness of cities
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 358.969 361.722 are remembered only as a recurring tick
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 362.169 365.606 And mid midway we meet the disappointed returning ones
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 365.834 368.656 without its being able to stop us in the headlong night
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 368.954 370.483 toward the nothing of the coast
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 371.239 372.136 At Bolinas
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 372.339 373.821 the houses doze
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 374.113 375.812 and seem to wonder why
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 376.26 377.853 through the Pacific haze
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 378.264 381.425 and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 382.088 384.555 Why be hanging on here like kites
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 384.858 385.625 circling
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 386.033 387.578 slipping on a ramp of air
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 388.156 389.459 but always circling
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 390.666 393.631 But the variable cloudiness is pouring it on
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 393.924 396.386 flooding back to you like the meaning of a joke
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 396.941 399.09 The land wasn't immediately appealing
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 399.461 403.708 We built it partly over with fake ruins in the image of ourselves
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 404.322 407.07 an arch that terminates in mid keystone
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 407.389 410.486 a crumbling stone pier for laundresses
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 410.902 412.293 an open air theater
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 412.896 415.95 never completed and only partially designed
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 416.7 421.76 How are we to inhabit this space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 422.024 424.194 as in a stage set or dollhouse
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 424.593 426.546 except by staying as we are
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 426.958 428.408 in lost profile
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 428.685 430.077 facing the stars
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 430.234 433.347 with dozens of as yet unrealized projects
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 433.746 436.075 and a strict sense of time running out
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 436.547 440.413 of evening presenting the tactfully folded over bill
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 441.49 443.724 And we fit rather too easily into it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 444.71 446.27 become transparent
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 446.592 447.851 almost ghosts
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 448.628 451.312 One day the birds and animals in the pasture
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 451.514 453.028 have absorbed the color
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 453.325 455.061 the density of the surroundings
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 455.513 456.915 the leaves are alive
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 457.077 458.638 and too heavy with life
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 460.175 462.478 A long period of adjustment followed
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A a 463.096 465.913 In the cities at the turn of the century they knew about it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 0.146 6.783 It's woven in the flowers of the patterned spread and lies and knows not what it thinks upon the bed

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 18.16 20.55 or do you still think that I am somebody else
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 20.886 21.577 Thank you

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 40.57 43.128 The servant's frown is the reader's patience
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 43.9 47.52 The servant goes to bed The patience rambles on
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 47.79 50.553 musing on the library's lofty holes

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 54.33 58.575 It pushes to the top stain of the wall its treetop's head of excitement

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 101.23 104.165 Or is it rock that is searched unrelentingly
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 104.381 104.885 Huh
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 106.22 110.774 And if some day men with orange shovels come to break open the rock which encases me

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 116.95 119.098 In pilgrim times he wounded me
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 119.497 121.091 Since then I only lie
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 121.57 124.757 My bed of light is a furnace choking me with hell
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 125.13 127.636 and sometimes I hear salt water dripping

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988 A a 129.74 135.494 because I'm one of the few to have held my breath under the house I'll trade one red sucker for two blue ones

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 89.303 95.209 Other dreams came and left while a bank of colored verbs and adjectives was shrinking from the light
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 95.858 98.382 to nurse in shade their want of a method
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 99.332 101.377 But most of all she loved the particles
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 101.839 106.008 that transformed objects of the same category into particular ones
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 106.729 110.097 each distinct within and apart from its own class
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 111.214 113.915 In all this springing up was no hint of a tide
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 114.394 116.427 only a pleasant wavering of the air
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 116.888 120.99 in which all things seemed present whether just passed or soon to come
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 121.621 123.01 it was all invitation
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 123.808 128.274 so much the flowers outlined along the night alleys when few were visible
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 128.715 133.843 Yet their story sounded louder than the hum of bug and stick noises that brought up the rear
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 134.458 136.97 trundling it along into a new fact of day
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 137.972 142.043  These were meant to be read as any salutation before getting down to business
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 142.692 144.185 but they stuck to their guns
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 144.862 147.696 and so much with their obstinacy in keeping with the rest
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 148.273 152.544 like long flashes of white birds that refused to die when day does
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 153.052 156.237 that none knew the warp which presented this major movement
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 156.656 157.979 as a firm digression
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 158.41 160.467 a plain that slowly becomes a mountain
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 162.495 170.169 So each found himself caught in a net as a fashion and all efforts to wriggle free involved him further inexorably
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 170.752 174.76 since all existed there to be told shot through from border to border
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 175.756 178.086 Here were stones that read as patches of sunlight
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 179.0 183.004 There was a story of the grandparents of the vigorous young champion
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 183.714 187.216 the lines once given to another now restored to the new speaker
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 188.017 191.142 Dinners and assemblies the light in the old home
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 191.693 194.083 the secret ways the rooms fed into each other
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 194.49 200.073 But all was wariness of time watching itself for nothing in the complex story grew outside
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 201.144 205.905 the greatness in the moment of telling stayed unresolved until its wealth of incident
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 206.281 207.725 pain mixed with pleasure
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 208.273 210.376 faded in the precise moment
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 210.801 212.002 of bursting into bloom
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 212.651 214.369 its growth a static lament
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 216.07 218.904 Some stories survive the dynasty of the builders
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 219.398 221.6 but their echo was itself locked in
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 222.337 226.263 became anticipation that was only memory after all
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 227.11 229.179 for the possibilities are limited
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 229.98 231.212 It is seen at the end
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 231.593 233.377 that the kind and good are rewarded
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 234.06 240.711 that the unjust one is doomed to burn forever around his error sadder and wiser anyway
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 241.867 243.239 Between these extremes
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 243.597 245.842 the others muddled through like us
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 246.358 247.129 uncertain
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 247.489 251.712 but wearing artlessly their function of minor characters who must be kept in mind
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 252.79 255.272 It is we who make this jungle and call it space
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 255.933 258.007 naming each route each serpent
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 258.353 264.613 for the sound of the name as it clinks dully against our pleasure Indifference that is pleasure
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 265.286 270.165 And would they be without an audience to restrict the innumerable passes and swipes
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 270.618 274.877 restored to good humor as it issues into the impervious evening air
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 275.551 278.682 So in some way although the arithmetic is incorrect
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 279.358 283.46 the balance is restored because it balances knowing it prevails
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 283.933 287.045 And the man who made the same mistake twice is exonerated
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 289.891 291.553 The Tomb of Stuart Merrill

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 387.124 388.841 somewhat interesting and puzzling
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 389.381 393.222 After I read one of your poems I'm always tempted to read and reread it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 393.778 397.704 It seems that my inexperience holds me back from understanding your meanings
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 398.955 407.323 I really would like to know what it is you do to magnetize your poetry where the curious reader always a bit puzzled comes back for a clearer insight
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 409.432 411.493 The canons are falling one by one
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 412.033 414.399 including le celebre of Pachelbel
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 415.061 418.051 The final movement of Francks' sonata for piano and violin
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 418.755 424.051 How about a new kind of hermetic conservatism and suffering withdrawal symptoms of same
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 425.212 426.147 Let's get on with it
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 426.541 427.742 but what about the past
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 429.301 431.485 because it only builds up out of fragments
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 432.356 435.651 Each evening we walk out to see how they're coming along with the temple
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 436.313 439.899 There is an interest in watching how one piece is added to another
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 440.708 445.502 At least it isn't horrible like being inside a hospital and really finding out what it's like in there
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 446.173 453.552 So one is tempted not to include this page in the fragment of our lives just as it's meaning is about to coagulate in the air around us
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A a 454.025 454.668 Father

Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 10.519 13.399 it was mine The woman said but now I'm finished with it
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 13.655 16.14 I came here today to give it to you
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 18.526 19.128 Seven
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 20.029 23.815 Twelve years ago my wife's sister went off to live in Taiwan
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 24.309 29.331 Her intention was to study Chinese which she now speaks with breathtaking fluency
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 29.524 34.237 and to support herself by giving English lessons to native Chinese speakers in Taipei
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 35.044 38.093 That was approximately one year before I met my wife
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 38.419 41.278 who was then a graduate student at Columbia University
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 42.279 46.059 One day my future sister in law was talking to an American friend
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 46.307 49.638 a young woman who had also gone to Taipei to study Chinese
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 50.193 53.95 The conversation came around to the subject of their families back home
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 54.219 56.877 which in turn led to the following exchange
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 57.906 61.745 I have a sister who lives in New York my future sister in law said
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 62.572 64.531 So do I her friend answered
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 65.105 67.545 My sister lives on the Upper West side
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 68.378 69.43 So does mine
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 69.755 72.549 My sister lives on West A Hundred and Ninth Street
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 73.449 75.299 Believe it or not so does mine
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 76.024 80.027 My sister lives at three oh nine West A Hundred and Ninth Street
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 81.178 82.22 So does mine
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 82.847 87.718 My sister lives on the second floor of three oh nine West A Hundred and Ninth Street
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 88.306 93.093 The friend took a deep breath and said I know this sounds crazy but so does mine
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 94.506 99.335 It is scarcely possible for two cities to be farther apart than Taipei and New York
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 99.506 106.052 They are at opposite ends of the earth separated by a distance of more than ten thousand miles And when it is day in one
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 106.163 107.486 it is night in the other
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 108.272 113.435 As the two young women in Taipei marveled over the astounding connection they had just uncovered
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 113.934 117.572 they realized that their two sisters were probably asleep at that moment
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 118.093 123.77 On the same floor of the same building in northern Manhattan Each one was sleeping in her own apartment
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 123.989 128.789 unaware of the conversation that was taking place about them on the other side of the world
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 129.964 134.659 Although they were neighbors it turned out that the two sisters in New York did not know each other
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 135.262 137.586 When they finally met two years later
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 137.825 140.393 neither one of them was living in that building anymore
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 141.583 143.4 Siri and I were married then
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 143.806 146.363 One evening on our way to an appointment somewhere
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 146.587 151.379 we happened to stop in at a bookstore on Broadway to browse for a few minutes
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 151.941 154.26 We must have wandered into different aisles
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 154.674 155.632 And because I
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 155.914 161.003  and because Siri wanted to show me something or because I wanted to show her something I can't remember
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 161.356 163.719 One of us spoke the other's name out loud
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 164.359 165.443 A second later
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 165.7 167.473 a woman came rushing up to us
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 167.882 170.725 You're Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt aren't you She said
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 171.029 174.026 Yes we said That's exactly who we are How did you know that
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 174.471 177.51 The woman then explained that her sister and Siri's sister
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 177.782 179.969 had been students together in Taiwan
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 180.881 183.067 The circle had been closed at last
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 183.636 186.241 Since that evening in the bookstore ten years ago
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 186.486 190.123 this woman has been one of our best and most loyal friends
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 192.385 193.029 Eight
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 194.985 198.085 Three summers ago a letter turned up in my mailbox
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 198.352 206.492 It came in a white oblong envelope and was addressed to someone whose name was unfamiliar to me Robert M Morgan of Seattle Washington
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 207.111 210.261 Various post office markings were stamped across the front
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 210.532 214.019 Not deliverable unable to forward return to writer
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 214.613 220.306 Mister Morgan's name had been crossed out with a pen and beside it someone had written not at this address
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 221.196 222.953 Drawn in the same blue ink
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 223.134 229.891 an arrow pointed to the upper left hand corner of the envelope accompanied by the words return to sender
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 230.631 236.859 Assuming that the post office had made a mistake I checked the upper left hand corner to see who the sender was
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 237.687 242.431 There to my absolute bewilderment I discovered my own name and my own address
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 243.288 247.773 Not only that but this information was printed on a custom made address label
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 248.168 253.177 One of those labels you can order in packs of two hundred from advertisements on matchbook covers
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 253.598 260.117 The spelling of my name was correct The address was my address And yet the fact was and still is
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 260.38 265.204 that I have never owned or ordered a set of printed address labels in my life
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 266.219 270.159 Inside there was a single space type written letter that began
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 270.373 274.64  Dear Robert in response to your letter dated July fifteen
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 274.95 276.284 nineteen eighty nine
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 276.449 282.099 I can only say that like other authors I often receive letters concerning my work
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 283.029 286.111 Then in a bombastic pretentious style
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 286.489 293.347 riddled with quotations from French philosophers and oozing with a tone of conceit and self satisfaction
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 293.569 295.437 the letter writer went on to praise
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 295.565 296.231 Robert
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 296.591 301.855 for the ideas he had developed about one of my books at a college course on the contemporary novel
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 302.425 304.225 It was a contemptible letter
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 304.372 307.183 the kind of letter I would never dream of writing to anyone
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 307.37 308.047 And yet
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 308.291 309.92 it was signed with my name
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 310.726 312.912 The handwriting did not resemble mine
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 313.21 314.607 but that was small comfort
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 315.139 319.47 Someone was out there trying to impersonate me And as far as I know he still is
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 321.082 324.974 One friend suggested that this was an example of mail art
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 325.555 333.706 Knowing that the letter could not be delivered to Robert Morgan since there was no such person the author of the letter was actually addressing his remarks to me
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 334.717 338.502 But that would imply an unwarranted faith in the US Postal Service
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 338.919 346.237 And I doubt that someone who would go to the trouble of ordering address labels in my name and then sitting down to write such an arrogant high flown letter
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 346.451 348.277 would leave anything to chance
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 348.758 349.615 Or would he
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 349.987 354.2 Perhaps the smart alecks of this world believe that everything will always go their way
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 355.244 358.914 I have scant hope of ever getting to the bottom of this little mystery
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 359.352 364.562 The prankster did a good job of covering his tracks and he has not been heard from since
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95 A a 365.567 372.615 What puzzles me about my own behavior is that I have not thrown away the letter even though it continues to give me chills every time I look at it

Beaulieu-Derek_Complete-Reading_Brodsky-Gallery_KWH-UPenn_3-31-11 A a 168.694 173.318 A city editor at lunch with a colleague pulled at his cigarette and talked
Beaulieu-Derek_Complete-Reading_Brodsky-Gallery_KWH-UPenn_3-31-11 A a 173.882 177.675 Oh for  lay off it will you said the city editor peevishly
Beaulieu-Derek_Complete-Reading_Brodsky-Gallery_KWH-UPenn_3-31-11 A a 178.195 184.973 The editor spread out his hands The editor frowned The editor was emphatic The editor laughed grimly

Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 26.822 35.751 Let's see now Where are we It is dust in New York about to be Christmas and next nineteen sixty one We are not detectives are we So we don't care what time it is
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 36.81 56.772 Where will we all be on New Year's Day Saint Bridget knows but she hasn't sent out invitations yet and yet and yet and yet as the Japanese are always those heathens saying And yet we know we really know don't we where we'll be We'll be at Claven's or Glennan's or McGivern's or McGovern's or McGillivray's dead drunk for Saint Bridget and for doom
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 57.589 59.825 Doom dum de doom
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 61.513 71.097 I am really thinking of Casay Sapeep by Norman Bluhm and I think it is a good idea death which will begin again in unbearable musique concrete
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 71.886 79.084 It is impossible to be American if you are not French first It is impossible to fuck without thinking of oeufs sur le plat
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 79.388 86.35 Or of being welcomed to Paris at night after a long boring train ride for women are like that
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 86.733 94.146 They make you feel you have traveled a long way and might as well take what comes and come to what will take you
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 95.181 99.427 But not Saint Bridget She comes first no matter how fast you are
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 100.387 106.485 and lingers last not just for breakfast but for the whole fucking weekend and lasts and lasts
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 106.862 108.611 That's how American women are
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 109.337 117.356 And you can't be French first unless you move pretty fast And Saint Bridget may not protect you but she does keep you alive if that's your idea of a good time
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 118.059 121.241 But stick it out if you can It'll make a man of you
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 122.048 135.601 But what about Saint Bridget Doesn't she have a history I know she doesn't have a record How long does a yawn last or a world or a gunfight That's what I mean It's inconsequential how many thoughts you have It's the violence that counts
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_Poetry-Project_St-Marks-NY_5-17-78 A a 136.338 151.966 I think everything began on August thirtieth nineteen thirty nine I don't think anything is interesting before that Except that I discovered it later I don't care when Saint Bridget was born Or Davide or Michelangelo or Diaghilev or William Carlos Williams

Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A a 186.033 189.363 I asked each one to tell me his or her thoughts
Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A a 189.746 191.689 and I tried to remember them all

Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A a 238.482 244.739 but what goes on inside her seems close to freedom I know as my power of imagination

Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A a 281.246 285.659 There is a mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding

Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A a 333.617 340.689 The way in which she shares her happiness as a matter of course gives me a sense of guilt because I do not feel the happiness

Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 6.85 10.405 It happens at times that come to us in a direct line
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 11.194 14.167 as light moving at a pretty pace
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 16.625 18.633 People in delirium move toward it
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 19.428 21.473 It has one of nature's failings
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 22.368 25.292 Loveliness is not deluxe when it's uncertain
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 25.814 27.538 Strange we have come back
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 45.57 48.574 So this type study is what started all the trouble
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 49.707 56.624 with any others coming  um I'd long been a fan of her work and had on weaving and knew it well
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 57.278 58.376 It hadn't um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 60.54 70.722  I just saw it differently one day and I went to um some lengths to try to publish it and it took a lot Just wanted to cover the things that I do and that that 
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 71.472 72.4 and um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 72.95 82.898 they put me in touch with the author's foundation which opened up a little bit of a Pandora's box because they brought out so many amazing things when I went to visit
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 83.41 84.583 I was then 
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 85.536 86.148 in 
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 86.937 91.999 um so I studied weaving and then started working on my own little type studies
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 92.484 93.449 and um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 94.094 97.128 I don't know about you but when I do monotonous work
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 97.569 99.244 like hammering away on a
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 100.118 104.784 you know a gridded typewriter space like this I'm always listening to things so
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 105.16 113.323 at this point I was listening to a l  really amazing interview with um Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein It's one of the the very early line break
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 113.775 118.699 and everything was fresh but they just  they had this stellar conversation about
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 119.057 124.251 landscape and page space where Susan Howe equates page space to freedom
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 125.556 126.696 Salt and sand
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 147.065 150.22 this is Annie and Joseph had Black Mountain College
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 152.041 160.487 and this is Laura County Livingfield one of Annie's students uh One of the few people to graduate from Black Mountain as I recall
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 160.878 166.544 And uh she took the weaving course from Annie and from um another teacher there
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 166.969 168.085 And uh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 169.002 170.055 thankfully
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 170.674 176.637 got like two hundred pages of extraordinary notes all hand typed with lots of
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 177.04 179.169 draft notation and drawings
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 179.679 180.341 um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 181.625 187.08  and while I was at the Elder's Archive or actually a little bit up there after I digitized
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 187.497 191.91 her entire file because it was de deteriorating rather rapidly and
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 192.352 194.93 maybe of lesser value than some of the other things there
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 195.634 196.223 um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 196.672 201.196 So I scanned it and I have it and now I'm just wondering 
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 201.582 204.264 wondering what to do I'm gonna give a talk uh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 204.722 213.289 in a few days on the archive but like other projects it takes me a long time to sort of get far enough to  that I know what I'm doing with something
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 213.651 215.332 so I just spent a lot of time learning
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 215.903 221.68 um I did trace the type studies from Black Mountain back to the Bauhau This is a um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 222.724 224.708 a weaving uh um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 225.102 228.063  cloth sample book of some of the type designs
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 230.552 233.55 This is my favorite Bauhaus study um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 235.048 236.583 done by Haja Rose
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 237.135 241.239 of uh just zeroes and lines Isn't it gorgeous Hm
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 245.418 247.068 So it's A Million Random Digits
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 247.493 248.949 See I totaled them up
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 249.42 249.991 Yeah
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 250.537 253.844 Think John Cage used this quite a bit track some of them down
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 256.192 268.348 So those of you who weave or um might weave would know that weaving's all about numbers so every thread  every intersection of the thread corresponds to at least two numbers
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 268.924 276.544 um so even though you're looking at a very simple piece of cloth you could really draw it out numerically in its entirety
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 277.163 277.691 um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 278.383 280.294 So the piece that I did for the
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 281.088 286.743 the book was simply a transcription  uh a lovely transcription of that page space
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 296.488 300.123  I was giving a talk recently and then I did a little homework on
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 300.621 304.704 etymology of text and textile and they come from the very same
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 306.34 307.474  stem
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 308.061 310.64 to weave But I love the text
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 310.94 319.606 actually has a   uh even a more fabric description of style tissue of literary work literally that which is woven web texture
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 320.633 324.429 So nice the way it's there so  there early on so
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 325.913 326.502 that's it
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A b 327.157 330.535 Thought we could open it up to questions You gave us have plenty of time
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 347.688 354.306 um I'm curious about the Dickinson quotes um I notice from the images that there were uh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 354.798 365.186 it seem it seemed to me specifically that there's a bunch of similar markings but they're slightly different Do they correspond to a certain thing like from the work
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 366.009 367.502 Like the the the
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 368.206 368.618 the
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 369.007 376.025 the way that you sewed the fabric in just the pregnant did it like  how does that  how did you figure out what what what to put where
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 376.17 376.639 Right
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 377.001 378.7 um It's uh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 379.192 389.38 as faithful a transcription as I could make so what I did was I scanned Dickinson's manuscript books which you you have here you have a fantastic Dickinson collection
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 390.231 403.56 um So it's a two volume book of um the folio work that she did and there are actually a a ton more uh manu  uh her manuscripts that aren't in that edition so that are
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 404.428 407.771 far more beautiful even the strange the light fragments
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 408.39 421.069 um But I worked with that because it showed the variant system so all those crosses that you saw embroidered um precede words and the words correspond to other words preceded by a cross within the poem
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 421.513 425.603 um So there's this rather intense um system of
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 426.211 429.949 alternate or um other ways to read poems
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 430.446 433.905 uh and they're very strange I mean sometimes they're close like uh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 435.552 439.727  like further and farther which aren't really close at all
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 440.121 442.542 and sometimes they're like um
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 442.953 452.782 like the lines like 'tis is  'tis as if our souls absconded suddenly and the variant is souls and the variants below the poem are world selves and sun
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 453.061 453.491 Oh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 453.934 454.402 Oh
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 454.481 462.593 so either  any of those could happen And then when you start to read the variants wha  between poems so say souls i is a variant more than once
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 463.532 466.887 then you have a very complex way that you start to get to read
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A c 467.179 467.701 Yeah
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 467.737 467.961 x

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12 A a 60.06 62.648 Did a lot of shopping at Ross when I was writing these poems
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12 A a 62.81 65.472 I worked across the street from one it was kind of dangerous

Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 496.377 497.11 And then
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 497.871 501.1 at that peak which is also the scarp edge is steep
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 501.667 503.366 And despite the rumors
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 503.748 505.426 inaccessible drop
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 506.047 507.159 on one side
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 507.717 510.957 the shallow slope on the other where the wood grows
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 511.514 513.065 That is mainly conifers
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 514.602 515.528 To be master
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 515.746 516.269 meant
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 516.794 519.468 to gather all those things the ownership of which
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 519.851 521.029 proves master good
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 521.549 522.249 A tribute
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 522.875 525.649 All other travelers are bound to pay
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 526.74 527.681 Two friends
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 528.27 530.45 who thought to scorn such enchantment
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 531.554 534.677 were walking through this wood one day side by side
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 534.84 535.83 They were talking
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 536.075 538.96 An old story begun as they entered the shade
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 539.496 540.845 wherein the trees
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 541.572 544.92 address the pair of wanderers with promises of succor
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 545.444 545.999 When
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 546.531 549.856 first one friend and the other heard the branches whisper
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 550.252 552.99 as if to himself alone And suddenly
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 553.541 556.37 a most powerful odor overcame their senses
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 557.111 557.957 And a woman
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 558.276 558.937 naked
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 559.412 563.076 broad hips and sloping a shoulder stepped out of the thicket
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 563.479 564.119 and beckoned
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 565.829 567.194 Now both these men
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 567.619 571.932 in flight from a band of relatives who presently were pillaging their homesteads
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 572.24 572.694 hoped
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 573.429 575.88 in the remotest hollow of the forest to find
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 576.26 579.559 sanctuary and an abandoned mill of which they read
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 580.881 583.3 Yet the sight of this creature turned them
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 583.698 589.28 Where they fell to arguing which of them first should address himself to her who stood expectantly by
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 590.365 593.68 They decided finally the softest spoken should
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 594.747 597.55 he who had first heard the trees murmur
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 598.366 600.979 His companion making a joke of it remarking
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 601.259 602.174 your mother
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 603.062 606.149 saw to it you were raised up was a due respect for womanhood
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 607.532 610.136 No sooner however was this agreed upon than he
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 610.434 612.864 this pleasant man began to waver
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 613.832 618.47 Wondering whether the other might not be better for the job and even expressing doubt
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 618.625 621.865 that he himself had any rights in this matter Perhaps
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 622.132 622.867 he chuckled
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 623.14 624.869 I'm not really here at all
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 626.2 627.619 He was pushed forward though
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 628.359 630.68 But when he approached the lady she told him
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968 A a 631.325 632.9 she might only yield herself
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 1.73 3.984 I thought to go to Chicago right away
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 4.115 5.261 and suddenly
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 5.643 6.762 inexplicably
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 7.053 8.359 my will failed me
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 9.63 13.91 Was it that I'd gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 14.1 15.51 That I needed no one else
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 16.68 19.77 An older woman a second cousin took me in hand
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 20.41 25.74 but I was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 26.17 27.801 Whatever our bodies were up to
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 29.55 36.001 Meanwhile I kept a close watch on that ladder activity thinking how now I would be able to satisfy Hilda when next we met
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 36.65 39.205 The knowledge however acquired is power
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 41.77 44.72 I must confess my feelings towards Hilda were not unmixed
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 44.97 47.069 At times I would decide to banish her
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 47.66 49.27 for she deserved nothing else
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 50.04 54.57 But then I would see that she was already banished and that I would have to think of something else
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 58.512 64.02 Well the first thing I had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 64.735 65.939 That's another story
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 66.63 70.07 A story all in itself and one really very much like this
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 70.71 72.343 So I don't have to tell it here
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 79.32 80.63 A year had passed
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 80.8 85.199 and Hilda had grown some four or five inches so that she was now six feet tall
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 86.52 91.351 Her wrists which had been long with a kind of vulnerability I found very attractive
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 91.536 92.569 were now bony
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 92.81 94.426 as though she'd been hung from a beam
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 96.0 99.776 Her face deprived of its previous bloom was long and sallow
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 100.03 101.576 In short I thought her ugly
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 102.55 105.88 Pitifully so although when she spoke the voice was the same
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 106.03 108.458 and I was glad to feel the pain of that survival
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 110.053 114.195 Her place was by no means the palace she had caused me to infer she came from
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 114.77 117.332 I had to spend the night on a couch in the living room
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 117.83 122.469 but by now I knew this kind of evasion of the realities of one's circumstance was widespread
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 122.872 125.04 and I'd even begun to slip into it myself
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 128.72 131.46 Next day when her parents were at work Hilda
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 131.645 134.53 who had taken the morning off sat with me in the kitchen
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 135.13 138.08 while her boyfriend raced his motorbike up and down the block
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 138.62 141.403 looking up at the window from time to time sneakily
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 141.66 144.125 I caught his glance once when I was looking down
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 145.495 147.032 How Hilda must have felt
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 148.02 151.72 She had returned to a different perspective and now here I was
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 152.15 155.7 the living proof of a will she wouldn't be likely to meet many more times
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 156.16 157.991 in the corner she had settled for
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 158.86 161.74 For it was clear to me now that all was over between us
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 162.775 164.18 Listening to her talk
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 164.58 167.9 I began to despise the person I had been the year before
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 169.36 171.25 Still I had the will to stay
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 171.47 175.46 but the will to leave under those circumstances offered more possibilities
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 175.78 178.069 and so I bowed gracefully to the inevitable
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 180.3 183.31 When I got up to go tears did come to her eyes
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 183.765 185.514 That moment I remember still
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 186.73 193.195 and I recognized immediately a feeling to be stored up against the ease if not the indifference of times to come
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 194.02 195.592 Many times in the future
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 196.05 199.386 I was to conjure that farewell when I was filled with despair
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 199.98 202.23 and often it sufficed to tip the balance
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 202.57 206.51 so that it could be thought to have caused several destructive rages over the years
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 207.98 209.998 But it's all water under the bridge now
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 210.82 212.707 Hardly worth the trouble of telling
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 213.03 216.22 and it's past time already to think that I have told it poorly
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 216.6 218.377 and to see that like it or not
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 218.837 220.923 there's nothing I can do about that either
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 222.63 224.68 Yes it might have all been otherwise
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 225.12 229.352 and yet for what it has to say about the human will in one of its manifestations
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 229.737 232.002 I wouldn't change one moment of the misery
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 232.44 235.278 For an easier way is not necessarily a better
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 236.51 239.95 and I believe I can speak not only for myself but for Hilda
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 240.7 243.03 who found out what it was like to meet her match
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 243.43 245.01 A man who scorned to take
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 245.17 247.279 either no or yes for an answer
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 253.42 254.207 Okay
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 260.893 265.3 Now th these are a series of short pieces with a general title of tight corners
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 267.349 267.757 
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 273.114 275.926 Have I been reading about twenty five minutes Feels like it
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 276.367 277.128 What's the time
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 279.337 280.146 Yeah I have
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 280.54 283.093 Okay I'll read I'll read for about ten minutes more
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 291.7 295.62 The boy elbows bent supports himself with his hands
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 296.18 297.452 His body prone
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 298.12 302.58 so that his face may approach the surface of this small pond from which he drinks
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 303.782 305.624 At his back the lane goes on
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 305.93 307.305 and the sheep go with it
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 307.87 311.053 The black dog at their back possibly a reminder of the artist
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 311.861 312.978 or one's self
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 314.06 317.699 Further on one wants to say though in another sense it's higher up
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 318.39 321.849 the lane crooks out of the shade and finds an open meadow
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 322.58 325.85 from where there must be a better view of that squat church tower
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 327.2 328.335 But the clouds
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 329.25 331.119 the clouds are more surely the point
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 331.89 334.339 Such clouds as are no longer to be seen
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 335.293 338.026 A rhythm of contraction would pull one in
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 338.32 339.82 deeper into itself
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 340.38 342.23 before that open space
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 342.62 343.968 Meadow and sky
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 344.564 345.8 is granted one
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 352.71 355.495 These are very loosely sequential and uh it's
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 357.65 360.046 it's happiest for me if I just uh make up
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 360.49 362.278 a different way through it each time
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 362.885 363.475 So
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 365.13 367.924 The pause is only while the eye selects something to do
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 368.64 371.262 While they watch the cat while they watch 
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 371.61 374.94 While they watch the cat stalks up the path to the front door
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 375.7 378.43 raises itself by putting its front paws
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 378.64 380.832 as high as it can reach against the door
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 381.24 383.561 and then resting on its left forefoot
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 384.17 388.711 it raises its right so that the knocker is moved out until the arc of the paw
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 388.96 390.95 falls below the arc the knocker makes
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 391.28 394.829 and thus the knocker falls back against the metal inset in the door
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 395.37 396.57 and as they watch
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 396.69 397.93 the door opens
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 398.118 399.55 and the cat slips in
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 399.86 401.65 as a woman's face appears
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 402.055 403.329 peering into the street
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 414.74 418.07 The two men have been walking for a long time one thinks
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 418.6 420.286 though perhaps no more than an hour
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 421.07 427.093 It's now becoming obvious that he has chosen the less traveled of two highways out of town in the direction he and his friend want to go
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 428.351 430.3 His friend was right and he was wrong
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 431.3 435.49 They resolve to take the cutoff they are now approaching and to walk its length
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 435.94 437.7 if no farm truck comes along
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 438.09 439.651 until the other highway is reached
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 440.36 441.809 The heat is considerable
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 442.02 443.567 It is early afternoon
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 443.98 447.481 On either hand huge fields of wheat find no wind to stir them
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 448.52 450.601 The only food they have is a chocolate bar
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72 A a 451.51 455.193 The time comes to eat it and one unslings the pack and they take it out
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 0.122 3.098 When the bunk shook so hard stuff fell from the ceiling
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 3.714 5.319 he saw whose hand it was
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 6.191 12.181 But the woman had pulled him so strongly into her front that a button of her dress had dug in his cheek above the bone
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A a 12.489 13.902 and that pain took over

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 561.86 564.441 I feared scorpions in their silence
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 564.95 566.706 and walked each morning
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 567.07 569.164 into the rising mountain
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 570.05 572.812 I vowed not to become the nullifying

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 580.42 583.854 To speak with the elevated precision of silence
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 584.99 586.825 From the marrow of consciousness
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 587.4 590.26 the living aspect of which appears solid
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 591.06 592.37 but isn't complete
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 592.971 594.204 until we have left
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 594.724 595.549 the word
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 595.765 596.724 the mountain

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 609.46 610.78 Nothing is anyone's
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 610.97 612.226 formally speaking
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 613.01 616.543 Even if you walk along this particularity of gasping
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 616.744 617.82 ordination
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 618.48 620.785 A mind is more akin to the moment
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 621.365 622.543 If you could hold it
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 622.74 624.28 and walk alongside me
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 624.493 625.681 I'd be somewhere
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 626.12 628.884 Driven to the particle within miniature
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 629.13 630.754 fluctuations of light
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 631.2 634.956 Not visible light but what turns you and pulls you
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 635.109 635.987 from your bed
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 636.2 639.788 on a morning as such you would rather not be bidden
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 640.937 642.686 Wakeful refraction
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 643.05 644.9 is the missing testimony
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 645.095 646.096 of leaving
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 646.873 648.163 Where are you going
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 648.49 649.953 And how will you get there
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 653.449 654.72 Scorpion ode
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 656.145 657.97 I watched the reader read
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 658.92 662.217 and the scores upon calendars looked back upon me
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 662.43 666.82 I tried to read from the book but even magnified I could not see it
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 667.54 670.527 What scurried beneath the book I cannot say
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 671.93 673.43 I hung upon the walls
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 673.937 675.12 Not regret
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 675.726 676.556 but a ship
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 676.981 678.004 below a bat
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09 A a 678.83 681.033 A door partially open
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A a 0.035 5.69 um A fascinating thing and and now we've both had a chance to read more literary history
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 5.8 9.942 so so we know going back to Blake of course who was such an outsider and printed
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 9.95 10.412 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 10.175 13.559 and engraved  create his own engraving techniques his own books
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 13.759 14.568 but um
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 14.72 18.46 most l literary  most poets exist within
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 19.51 21.724 you know micro networks of
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 22.432 23.706 publishers or
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 23.85 25.944 bookstores that publish their work
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 26.094 30.535 that circulate to other poets and you can sort of trace what those networks are
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 30.41 31.027 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 30.96 32.362 and I'm not saying network in a
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 32.96 35.58 contemporary  bureaucratic sense I mean
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 34.608 35.38 Right yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 35.96 40.688 you could trace those connections by looking at the where the books f  the flow of the books
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 36.053 36.584 Yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 37.516 38.288 Oh yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 40.62 41.461 Absolutely
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 40.875 45.148 and who publishes them So you're really right at the center So while you might
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 41.817 44.474 Yeah that's one of the most interesting  yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 45.172 48.69 found it and I could imagine quite difficult because distribution is
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 49.14 54.436 always a a very difficult and unrewarding thing Nonetheless you learned a lot about the
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 55.07 56.237  what was going on
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 56.432 57.807 how things worked
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 57.084 60.195 Well yeah I did and I  but I I was also
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 60.42 62.556 st  I was traveling a bit
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 62.66 67.118 and visiting libraries and that's how I was selling the books that we were distributing
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 67.7 74.765 People rarely bought anything from a list that we would send out but if I would go around and visit people in special collections libraries
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 74.384 74.942 Yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 75.04 76.875 they would invariably buy
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 77.16 78.98 many things maybe
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 78.497 80.486 So that's when you got started with the
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 81.28 86.07 um  your relationship with with special collections and libraries and placing books
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 84.752 89.47 That started it the distribution and then  but then I realized when I did the Cage book I
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 89.918 93.2 I knew that if I went around and showed it to people that they
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 93.766 96.197  I would be able to sell this you know and
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 95.061 95.572 Yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 96.37 98.103 so what made it possible
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 98.58 99.716 um having that
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 99.975 105.842 end point you know that end user point in mind and I'd met a lot of people by then
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 106.43 110.647 um I did  early  in the early eighties I came out and
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 110.853 116.053 attended the  something called rare book school that was a summer program at Columbia University
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 114.523 115.172 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 116.504 117.527 and this was uh
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 117.61 118.446 filled with
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 119.28 123.04 all kinds of librarians from around the country and elsewhere
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 123.592 125.78 studying aspects of rare books
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 126.017 126.602 um
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 127.1 130.89 and that was very useful in beginning to meet people some of them I
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 131.0 135.544 still know now All this time and they were at the beginning of their career then as well
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 134.956 135.526 Yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 135.598 137.566 Now m maybe a
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 135.903 137.529 
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 137.794 139.26 unfair or a
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 139.51 145.85 stereotype but a lot of people involved with r rare books for sure but fine press printing
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 146.51 147.789 apart from you and
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 148.3 155.393 Charles Alexander and a you know a few others and leaving aside the cheaper use of letterpress by x Burning Deck or 
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 155.684 156.659 Tuumba and others
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 157.11 160.132 wouldn't have been interesting contemporaries especially not radical
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 160.42 160.957 uh
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 161.141 162.132 innovative
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 162.503 163.916 poetry they would publish
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 163.294 163.835 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 164.26 169.38 known works and it would be about the way in which those works were printed and set
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 169.778 171.116 or more conventional
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 171.5 173.44 writing so you were combining
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 174.18 176.57 very radical poetic content
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 177.19 179.415 radical in the sense of
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 179.83 181.05 unconventional
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 181.433 182.648 and contemporary
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 182.768 183.337 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 183.334 185.148 versus more traditional
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 185.46 186.039 Right
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 186.58 187.178 work
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 187.682 189.2  Yeah that's why I
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 189.89 190.597 wanted
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 191.535 192.681  x was I
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 193.14 196.818  my interest in the books that we were distributing was limited
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 197.61 202.54 to the physical aspects of the work and and and the con  and and nothing wrong with the content I didn't want to
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 199.517 200.128 Right
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 203.305 209.84 x I I I love Moby Dick x a chapter of Moby Dick x famously x

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 205.633 209.792  Yeah there you go  
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 210.106 213.08 x probably be more than one but one of the people you mentioned
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 213.25 219.836 It's a it's a beautiful thing to behold an x It's still not the same as doing a John Cage book or or
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 215.745 216.806 Absolutely
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 218.556 220.877 That's right Yeah Exactly Yeah

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 224.658 227.406 But what I'm interested in drawing on that for a second is
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 227.82 228.967 you know the syncretic
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 229.33 231.054 uh which is so important
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 232.07 239.502 to me in poetics In your case the syncretism has to do with combining aspects of a very traditional fine press printing
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 239.366 239.951 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 239.756 241.179 and knowledge of

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 245.95 246.801 content
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 246.714 247.277 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 247.36 252.111 that you that you put into that because a lot of us  I mean think about  the stuff
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 252.46 260.581 th that I was publishing as as kind of a nonpublisher publisher but still I mean x you know we typed stuff and we Xeroxed it  It was fine
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 259.025 260.133 Yeah yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 260.6 267.65 And it has a nice quality to it and I'm all for it but x a lot more people doing the kind of stuff that I was doing with desktop and
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 260.674 261.627 It's fine
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 267.88 270.28 the rest Lot less people
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 268.336 268.867 Mhm
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 270.83 272.35 even if they wanted to
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 272.725 274.693 could have done what you did because they just
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 274.761 276.339 w wouldn't have known how to do it
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 276.422 276.985 Yeah
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 277.41 282.576 Yeah they  no it wasn't  you're right you're right there weren't there weren't many models really I mean uh

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 286.341 287.62 uh people

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 298.615 299.638 very much in
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 299.91 303.197 the fine printing tradition and I think that what Granary
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 303.96 306.893 does did and does was to
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 307.23 309.443 push it further and
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 309.818 310.483 um
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 311.196 314.061 try to find a proper
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 314.69 318.33 relationship between all of the materials of
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 319.072 320.666 th the object
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 320.509 324.956 So this becomes a kind of a crossover into what you could call art as books now
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 325.224 328.25 w  at what point did you begin to see
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 328.7 331.24 your work at Granary as

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A b 346.309 349.66 though not the only thing is is that you did artist's books
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 349.79 351.641 Yeah I would say that um
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 351.831 352.704 I I was
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A c 353.108 355.722 aware of artist's books in

Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 203.055 211.187 He was talking at the front  at the Quaker's Meeting House in Philadelphia and he just sort of glazed over this little topic about all these men that he met in

Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 217.272 227.011 and I asked them at the Q and A to tell us more about that and

Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 236.213 241.464 that we're inst  and we're not talking about what's going on we're not talking about what we're doing
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 241.858 243.96 we're not talking about what they've been going through
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 244.372 250.169 And they go back to Germany and they marry German women and they vow to never come back here again
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 250.832 253.009 And it's something I think we need to think about
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 253.962 255.248 I think about it a lot
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 257.004 258.42 This is by Adonis
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 259.32 261.601 He's one of the Temouzi poets from Beirut
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 262.071 264.232 It's just a little poem that I wanted to read
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 264.941 266.486 It's called The Beginning of Naming
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 267.701 270.656 We have named every place in the name of a sword
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 271.514 272.87 And have started to build
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 273.449 274.68 a moon from chalk

Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 280.448 282.712 We have created a kingdom of mere things
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 286.889 289.714 So I just wanted to read one more thing and then I'm finished
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 290.181 292.58 um This is for my new project that I'm working on
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 293.26 295.286 We're um  as a collaboration with uh
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 295.993 297.015 Erica Kauffman
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 298.544 310.231 I'd  I forgot to print out the maneuvers We have three maneuvers we bring She writes in Brooklyn I write in in Philadelphia at the same time and I'd  we  I'd call her on her cell phone I don't have a cell phone so I'd call her from a pay phone at noon
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 310.786 312.801 and then we exchange these two words
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 313.766 320.842 But the maneuvers are not  this is not documentary poetry the maneuvers are not the poem They're just to sort of throw us off a
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 321.601 322.46 a routine
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 323.057 323.965 and um
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 324.733 330.874 So the poems are our own but we do share two words but I meant to bring the maneuvers but anyway I'm just going to read this without them
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A a 332.279 335.477 So this is my poem from the beginning of the series

Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 152.81 154.67 of all the rights I don't have
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 156.07 162.137 Something as serious as the indefinite detention of citizens becoming law was on page
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 162.227 164.948 A six instead of on the front page
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 165.65 168.07 Well at least it wasn't in the style section
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 169.74 175.6 Well let's hope that the clinical trials for the human rights mutation drugs are successful A S A P
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 176.06 177.36 Clinical trials
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 178.15 186.224 Yep The pharmaceutical companies are all over this one They need to get some new drugs in the pipeline because their top money makers are going generic
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 186.56 192.95 Don't worry the National Institutes of Health scientists are making sure the trials are the creme de la creme of research
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 194.11 196.04 Lib has an a ha moment
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 196.707 197.447 So
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 198.13 199.96 U S taxpayers are funding this
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 200.625 201.3 Right
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 201.977 203.042 Terrific
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 203.44 210.008 By law publicly funded clinical trial participants must be given standard of care for whatever is being tested so
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 210.214 211.413 for a human rights drug
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 211.61 213.8 that means they get universal healthcare
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 214.139 215.012 Then
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 215.26 216.565 when the trials are completed
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 216.632 218.963 we'll use the march in rights of the BayhDole act
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 219.068 221.079 to get the money to restructure our health system
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 221.99 225.102 BayhDole Is that some sort of welfare scam
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 225.74 227.06 Yeah you could say that
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 227.252 228.349 For the drug companies
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 228.56 237.355 The government gives our money to researchers to test and patent drugs Then the pharmaceutical companies license them and make billions of dollars on our dime
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 237.531 237.918 but
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 238.42 242.504 there's a little known clause in the law that says if the public safety is at risk
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 242.645 245.772 the government can march in and take back the patents
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 245.97 247.65 Deepening her voice 
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 248.065 250.632 universal healthcare for the public safety
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 251.46 254.774 It will be so cool when health is finally a human right
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 255.087 256.024 Well
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 256.234 258.907 health isn't a right it's something we do
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 259.01 260.69 If we think of health as a right
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 260.83 265.93 then it's something we're owed which by definition means it's something someone else has
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 266.601 270.476 In this case that would be the healthcare corporations and big pharma we don't want that
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 270.598 274.895 But we can take back our healthcare system and rebuild it as a cooperative enterprise
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 274.948 278.107 with the profits from the patents on taxpayer funded research
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 279.07 282.77 Now this will really be fun to do when we march in can I have my iPod
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 282.656 286.857  You bet we'll all be on a roll

Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 337.333 338.249 are on hold
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 338.44 340.61 after hearing that the festival's organizer

Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A a 368.534 369.151 x
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13 A b 369.285 370.434 Stop already
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 0.109 4.527 Why we say of an experience or of a practice that it is deep or sinister
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 5.279 8.926 On the surface he is dealing with the nature of the mystical or the religious
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 9.482 18.606 But beneath that and almost certainly unintentionally the broader question being asked is why do we adjectivize at all How do we come to say bad of that
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 19.489 22.305 It is in the context of this that he asks quote
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 22.784 33.408 But could I not just as well ask when I see someone killed is it simply what I see that makes an impression on me or does this come with the hypothesis that someone is being killed here end quote
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 35.501 38.711 You can see that I leave him with credit for his double interrogative
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 39.206 46.204 But I can't help but wonder what it is that makes him experience a difference between what he sees and what he thinks he sees
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 56.975 58.297  um
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 59.999 62.141 Now I'll read uh some newer poems
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 64.623 65.612 And uh
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 68.638 70.968 some of these were published in abacus that uh
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 71.373 75.73 David mentioned that was  that the title of the collection of which was titled Riot Now
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 76.416 77.835 Some of these I read uh
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 78.724 81.005  Recently at Saint Mark's and some of them I didn't
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 81.521 88.011 uh But again and like Michael because tomorrow's Valentines Day I tried to pull together some that uh
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 89.23 91.412 had something of that about them
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 92.019 98.447 And I'm going to read those first and then if time permits perhaps I'll read some of the others that uh have some other things about them
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 101.076 105.59 I want to touch your little nipples and put my hand between between your legs 
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 106.002 108.028 I want to hold you from behinds
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 108.459 110.231 so that your ass feels my cockhead
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 111.202 112.98 In the afternoon I finally kiss her
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 113.467 115.863 and in the evening repeatedly kiss her neck
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 116.535 118.204 I kiss your eyes and all over
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 118.673 120.7 I c  wouldn't kiss anyone instead
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 121.367 122.872 In the evening I penetrate her
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 123.358 125.263 In the morning we almost go to bed
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 130.259 133.147 Desire affection with an occasion really
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 133.899 136.387 Desire affection with a location
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 137.399 140.099 You strung and incredible tent across an abyss
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 141.063 144.491 There is no connection between a cardinal and the infinite number
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 144.957 149.211 I want to habituate the filthy pore of this and every other world for no reason
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 149.71 150.341 I love you
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 151.176 153.803 The world is moved with your little street tragedies
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 154.398 157.711 You always make think of licking the back of the neck of the proletariat
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 158.664 161.449 We'll see if you can get by with half of what you think you need
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 161.895 163.892 It's lust We'll call it lust
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 164.276 167.347 Her poignant breasts peer damaged by description
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 167.881 168.682 A vulva
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 169.245 173.48 Along the top of the hill the row of shining teepees we'll one by one set light to
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 174.046 177.905 Emboldened by love so to speak we came away in her hands
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 183.126 185.365 Her eyes took me with arithmatic accuracy
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 185.927 189.367 But this is years later in old San Juan in the heat of the night
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 190.217 195.096 Mary Angelica it is with great pleasure that I introduce you to Reuben and to Miriam
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 196.179 198.746 I remember Miriam and Reuben like it was yesterday

Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 205.215 209.778 I spend a lot of time thinking about the difference between a zero set and a null set
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 210.439 213.88 And I come up with you shaded African of the islands
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 218.597 222.535 This one has a title The title is uh The Idea of Order at Lizard Key
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 224.604 228.656 There are a lot of people out there who believe in a God without rightly knowing why
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 229.439 231.381 It must be because of the museums
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 232.503 237.057 Compare that with some lazy little quiet afternoon bombshell sex in the byways of Queens
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 237.554 239.174 That's what I was thinking about tonight
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 241.378 247.019 Lizard Key is a place in a I I forget whether it's a novel or a story by uh J G Ballard
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 249.131 251.084 Next time I read here I'll read that story
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 254.701 258.257 To see you in other places with other men's looks on her faces
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 259.04 263.71 I sent her in other place  in other pieces with other men's licks on your creases
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 264.459 267.22 You have an urge to live I wouldn't think to interrupt
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 267.808 269.525 No one comes alone to my house
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 270.161 274.858 Comme je t'aime je t'aime beaucoup Je temps je temps et je temps tout
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 276.128 281.158 It's kind of hard to understand if you don't look at it and especially if you have to rely on my ability to pronounce French words
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 281.667 287.174 But it's obviously uh Comme je t'aime je t'aime beaucoup and uh how I love you how much I  uh how I love you very much or something like that
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 287.52 288.436 and then um
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 289.077 293.149 It's kind of a play on words between t'aime T apostrophe A I M E meaning
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 293.701 297.152 you that I love or whatever and je temps or time
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 297.547 299.173 or uh sod it's kind of uh
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 299.99 304.444  how I love you I love you very much I time I time and I time too
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 308.784 311.011 An hour of this is worth a hundred days
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 311.562 315.184 The weather the way it is and thoughts of you the way you are are enough
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 316.117 317.246 Your neck is beautiful
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 318.108 321.87 The glazed eyes of the happy municipal people turn me on onto you
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 322.713 324.716 The long blonde alleys
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 325.638 327.294 I'll always feel this way about you
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 328.421 330.363 Worry your little head about me Dusty
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 330.769 334.066 Or if I douche my head where the stars were but that isn't you
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 335.013 338.867 Then time when every ounce of my body weighs as much as every other ounce of my body
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 339.329 340.852 It's then I think most of you
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 349.138 351.905  A series of Valentine's poems wouldn't be complete without
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 352.494 353.604 some mention of
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 354.672 357.227 this lustrous society that we live in
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 358.524 360.539 This is called Capitalism in Form
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 363.254 368.169 The fruits and vegetables are poorer alongside the poorer avenues to the east
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 368.848 371.524 But that's okay There's more cheap beer
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 372.517 375.256 The dirt in the glass looks inharmonious and bleak
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 375.763 377.432 See what I mean about the adjectives
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 377.926 380.026 To anyone who can or cannot see
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 382.262 392.971 If it has not been the program then it has always been the effect of the writing of the Quran Bible Torah and their near accomplices to limit human nature and to do so absolutely
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 394.105 399.689 It has similarly been the effect of secular Are there any literatures to repress human nature
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 400.381 407.741 And to have done so by instilling examples of thought and action always somehow so much less than what we might achieve
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 409.165 416.301 By appearing to be external to us literature has been a fabric of pegs against which we jolt of artificial limits
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 417.053 419.056 In the post prehistoric period
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 419.578 421.877 in other words at the beginning of the historic
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 422.28 425.982 there may have been a writing of content and event of actions
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 426.586 429.589  Nature is the emblem we would pick from that
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 430.718 438.563 The civilization of the languages was primarily a process of the opening up of them to the loads of the concepts of time
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 439.341 446.759 The culminated in the myths of romantic disillusionment a period which is just now flapping its flatulent last
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 447.61 450.359 Industry was its latest large motif
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 451.619 454.028 the writing and arts which are now starting
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 454.536 456.423 lapping the romantic as it were
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 456.869 460.661 reflect the beginning of the new age to which everything will be absent
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 461.14 464.975 in which pretense will be the genre of everything including desires
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 465.709 469.756 Again space will be the first to empty time right behind
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A a 470.211 473.069  We're talking about two three lifetimes
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 0.55 13.026 The beats were almost always serious too I remember That got me into the literary quarterlies and through the x writer's workshop and helped me understand my own dark corners and sharp angles and then one day I realized how much of what I was reading and often admiring
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 13.35 20.895 going on around me in the poetry world was a kind of picking of scabs and flashing the open sores and wounds as badges and credentials
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 21.25 25.334 and how O'Hara totally sidestepped that contemporary tendency by tone
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 25.81 31.507 and choice of vocabulary that cut through the hopelessness of so much poetry and replaced it with the joy of writing a poem
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 32.07 33.97 What a simple but wonderful revelation
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 35.02 36.775 the joy of writing it down
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 37.481 38.21 That was what
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 38.86 46.154 x  that was what it suddenly seemed to be about in a way that made me think of all I had heard the painters of his time were trying to do get across the action of the
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 46.182 52.194 creating rather than the product that was so finished it showed no signs of the activity the energy and spirit of the actual work
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 52.515 53.297 that went into it
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 53.77 57.108 O'Hara's poems were little excursions into the act of writing poems
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 57.54 61.485 with the kind of mindset that keeps us trying sex with strangers again and again
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 62.0 63.76 The hope that this time is going to be great
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 64.64 65.908 give us much pleasure
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 66.175 74.042 and satisfy a lot of frustration and totally annul the boring horrible deadening killing in fact effects of living the modern urban existence
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 75.808 77.637 I think I rewrote that phrase
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 78.4 86.02 But I still couldn't reconcile that achievement with the personal references though they were becoming more and more familiar and thus less and less elitist though still somewhat obscure
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 86.45 92.808 And one day I was teaching contemporary poetry to a college class and talking about a poem of O'Hara's I think it was a step away from them
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 93.01 100.32 After talking about the poem Steps and how it overcame the sadness of love's ending or going sour amid the big city grind and in discussing how it did this
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 100.521 107.48 mostly through the structure of the poem because by then I'd learned so much about movement and rhythm and construction I could see how well made O'Hara's poems are despite
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 107.81 116.305 or maybe because of their conversational flow and in the process of explaining why the poems were good from a strategic and structural point of view because they accomplished this message of hope
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 116.68 123.834 in the face of contemporary despair and despite wellfounded reasons for lamenting our condition or his condition in the specific circumstances of the poem
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 124.16 137.404 and did it through technical agility so refined the surface ambience of ease and a kind of glib grace was hardly disturbed suddenly I caught myself starting to cry and I never cried back then in fact except for a short interlude of about a year of weepiness I never cried period
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 137.78 148.39 except over old movies or musicals and it was that heartstring O'Hara had suddenly plucked in me through his poetry that sang so naturally and yet skillfully of overcoming stupidity and tediousness of so much of life
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 149.72 162.728 The true romantic only without the pretentious and really elitist selfconscious and selfsatisfied seriousness of the walking wounds of contemporary poetry because by mocking the tone of the real and original romantics partly through the use of quotation marks and italics
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 163.17 168.727 which is a sort of what campy dialogue often depends on as others have pointed out it means talking in italics
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 169.37 177.245 and exclamation points and exclamations Oh he was making himself vulnerable to a x scalpel unlike the confessional poets and others of his contemporaries
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 177.48 184.477 Even the seemingly honest beats who always exposed themselves in ways that demanded applause or appreciation for the courage of the exposure
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 184.484 187.91 or the extent of selfdestruction the exposure caused or exposed
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 189.3 204.087 et cetera But not O'Hara his defenses were the shrewdest and toughest of all because they weren't defensive at all but appeared to be all offensive only the offensive was mounted against his own and others' defensiveness thus he could be attacked for elitism when he's in fact he's our most democratic poet since Whitman
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 204.75 214.85 bringing that tradition full circle by reversing Whitman's posing as the common man brother to all which reduced everyone to the level of anonymity that Whitman's poems ensured would never really be his fate so he could afford it
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 215.497 223.464 I'm talking about the pose which perhaps became a reality much the way Ginsberg seems to have which is not the poetry because Whitman's poetry is often wonderful and amazing
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 223.68 231.339 and very much more the source of much that is associated with O'Hara and the New York school than many of the French writers constantly attributed with having influenced the New York scene
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 231.94 247.748 Although O'Hara is also sort of a Baude  Baudelairean reverse making the most of the worst of Baudelaire's pessimistic predictions about urban existence by preserving the best of perceptions and emotionalisms the city scene can generate but instead O'Hara elevates everyone to the level and attentive familiarity of stars
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 248.18 254.748 throwing in the names of personal friends alongside those of personal heroes and famous and worldrenowned producers and creators of the culture
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 254.99 261.354 that has come to be ours and which he defined before most of us and with the clarity of the lyrics of a Hollywood musical or a Madison Avenue add
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 261.74 266.144 Yet with all the subtlety and imaginative exuberance of a great wit and passionate lover
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 266.63 269.35 What an incredibly seductive combination for a poet
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 269.79 270.867 His poems are sexy
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 271.41 283.407 The language is often intimate the images voluptuous and often exotic the energy seemingly endless to the point usually reassuring and flattering with just enough elusive connections to make us want to put out the time and energy to make ourselves as attractively intelligent
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 283.63 287.161 and perceptive and experienced and in the know as the poems assume we are
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 288.2 290.964 He refused to accept an audience that was not as good as he was
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 291.038 298.97 and in that way included us all in the community of friends he admired and addressed and referred to along with the proper names and familiar rhythms of the most ordinary people and things
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 299.93 307.977 all of which he incorporated into descriptions and narratives that included the proper names and rhythms of the most extraordinary things the rest of us are only now x after the poems were written
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 308.014 308.577 written
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 308.767 312.962 getting hip to and how well they fit and work and complete the artistry of O'Hara's genius
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 313.71 323.13 He helped me realize that the reason I wrote poems was often simply because the rush the feeling that accompanied the writing of the poem especially when it seemed to be coming out good couldn't be duplicated anywhere else
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 323.52 332.868 It wasn't a substitute for anything else going to bed with someone beautiful and tough or eating a delicious and totally satisfying meal or outwitting a horribly abusive competitive creep in a conversation
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A b 333.23 342.938 and it wasn't a grueling act of anguish and pain getting in touch with all the crabbed secrets of the psyche and exposing to them to the wellorganized and systematic scrutiny of some poetic form or strategy no

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 9.857 13.783 the poem must preserve a place to remain in what is not real
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 14.652 16.921 The poem must be an active force

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 227.952 232.26 Last winter I had the pleasure of composing a somatic exercise
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 232.891 234.536 with my friend C A Conrad
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 235.735 242.473 Our exercise was based on downtown New York City cellist Arthur Russell's masterpiece World of Echo
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 243.37 248.084 It is difficult to describe Russell's World of Echo for anyone who hasn't heard it before
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 248.854 257.421 It has a rare spiritual quality which issues from Russell's songwriting voice and cello playing but also from the production values of the album
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 258.15 267.342 Perhaps the following passage from Tim Lawrence's biography of Russell Hold Onto Your Dreams makes palpable Russell's subtle accidental studio processes
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 269.202 273.875 During these sessions it became standard for Arthur to splice together separate tapes
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 274.424 282.073 and he would regularly grab a track from one tape and fly it into the multitrack of another while his onlooking engineer tried to stay calm

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 283.588 289.768 We would be mixing on a piece of tape and I would see the splice go by recalls Eric Liljestrand
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 290.133 294.647 It was all very confusing I could never really tell what we were working on until it was done
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 295.157 295.891 unquote
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 296.911 306.34 The ghostly accidents that arose from Arthur's insistence that they rerecord over old tape became became an integral part of the sonic fabric
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 307.814 313.63 At one point Conrad told me that he used the album to heal a knee injury that he had suffered
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 314.258 325.872 Russell was trained foremost as a musician and only afterwards as a Buddhist So the healing powers of his music I can only imagine come from the confluence of these two disciplines
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 327.022 336.341 For our exercise Conrad and I decided to have Russell's album playing on four different stereos throughout the five story house for a twelve hour duration
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 336.814 342.518 Twelve hours is a long time to do anything and especially to listen to an album triply on repeat
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 343.65 346.845 Among the constraints I recall imposing on myself
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 347.3 348.981 many had to do with memory
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 349.881 353.115 Trying to forget the last line I had written before continuing
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 353.598 357.409 Interrupting myself mid line then picking up with the line again
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 357.937 363.161 These exercises in intention and distraction I felt were true to Russell's music
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 363.673 370.225 So was a certain circularity that the exercises were trying to induce amidst interruption and disjunction
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 372.398 379.822 We also spent much of the nine hours improvising lines with a set of books I had brought with me from New York City to Philadelphia
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 380.196 384.613 many of which were of a wholly metaphysical or medical import
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 385.623 390.684 Among these books included the writings of Henry Corbin and his acolyte Christian Jambet
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 391.301 393.51 Oliver Sacks's Seeing Voices

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 408.416 416.45 I also remember reading a number of recently published poetry books including Jules Boykoff's courageous Hegemonic Love Potion
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 417.566 422.472 Russell perhaps more than any other composer I'd come into contact with
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 422.945 434.755 understood the importance of tuning his body and his mind as instruments coeval with his cello and the other instruments drum machines guitar tabla he would use throughout his compositions
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 435.519 446.838 Via studio production Russell gave access to the occult and otherworldly in ways similar to Conrad's use of his own body as a source of information and vision
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 447.19 449.862 explored through the somatic exercise
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A a 452.648 456.375 And to conclude I'd like to read um my contribution

Dorn-Ed_Complete-Recording_North-Atlantic-Turbine_London_1967 A a 130.532 138.645 but settled for a quiet kiss when halfway through it abruptly and to our amazement we found ourselves in some small station smiling
Dorn-Ed_Complete-Recording_North-Atlantic-Turbine_London_1967 A a 139.066 147.209 into the equally smiling face of a railway man idling on that minor and unremembered platform Nonetheless

Dorn-Ed_Complete-Recording_North-Atlantic-Turbine_London_1967 A a 275.136 309.844 And if black flies inhabit with the insistence of castanets the delta of Inuvik in you Aklavik around you Aklavik they form a core and critical shell of inflexible lust only in the permafrost is the new home of the children of the sun in whose nakedness is the desire not desire in whose beauty is the flame of red permafrost a thousand feet deep in whose frail buildings the shutter of total winter in whose misshapen sun the children bay

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 2.658 20.142 still under celebrated in our culture They  they've mapped these fears of seduction and pleasure onto the television the Game Bo  Boy the virtual world with its constant gratifications I mean it's not that there aren't issues with these of things but there's a kind of sense that Oh you know we'll we'll we'll put distance in there
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 20.516 29.902 And there's a kind of moral superiority in this critique that supposes that you know we should be didactic you know we we should teach people how to not have pleasure with mass culture
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 30.367 30.998 Why
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 31.394 59.814 You know that that's not  doesn't get at the systemic issues It doesn't get at what is what is a problem here um So and it takes for granted the idea that someone who's intellectual they're outside the culture they're superior to it right Artists  art for them is outside the ideologies right Resistance um you know the the  resistance is our job you know We are the moral conscience of the culture and if you challenge this as I have done on many o occasions and I ha I have uh something I want to put forward to replace  resistance
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 60.211 77.226 Resistance said a critic recently to me when I gave a talk in New York Resistance will die hard And he narrowed his eyes as he said it and he hunched up his shoulders in a kind of defensive way And they were very well fed and very well padded shoulders in a butter soft lamb leather coat
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 77.811 83.885 And I though Yes resistance will die hard Especially among those with career investments in its stock
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 86.621 90.644 So as I was writing this piece along came a press release from Joy Garnett
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 91.13 96.19 And it came through the email um and it b  it had in it this brand new painting that she sent
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 96.633 108.815 And I thought It was so wet it even looked wet on the screen It was like you know just sort of wonderful And the press release said Joy Garnett continues her exploration of the malleability of instantly globalized images
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 109.316 142.863 um She said she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates And I thought Yes this is so interesting She's like doing this um you know remediation project and just working with these images and it felt so much to me like the images in my book um of of real things Of things a person's obser observed or photographs and they're so striking that they sort of stop your day And I could tell she was having that same experience and that these things just come out during it stops her and she thinks What an amazing image But to really understand the image she has to remake it She has to repaint it
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 143.843 150.742 So again I know that experience I sit down I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 151.452 155.681 So why is that What is that doing What is Joy what is Joy doing um

Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 265.717 267.651 Going to read now this  I I can't find 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 269.293 270.838 just a breath 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 271.682 273.0 Form I haven't worked on
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 273.389 291.326 and so it won't got beat  uh and and anyway this form is is intended as uh sequences of light  I've I've uh been more um and and and I went through a period which I reacted against the cantos because it seemed to me that Pound is always i i  after all we had no other poems but the cantos since Pound began on the cantos
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 291.821 353.461 I've many different fascinations with the cantos They've always been essential I began with the cantos at about the age of eighteen or nineteen and and all my life have  had many different ideas of them Now recently I've been haunted by them again and they seem to me this time to open up a great freedom uh a a And that is a freedom in the relation to the way in which I compose things thematically all the way through And and and I thought if I were to open up let's say just call something just passages as you might call something just fragments Try to prevent it from forming into a poem and it's a Pindar poem or apprehension formed into a turtle that's symphonic The symphonic form uh uh or or the sonata form fascinated me uh They  uh I like to orchestrate a large form I like to have related movements and and and boxe  poems within poems a an and now I wanted to see if I could let that loose uh Now of course I can't do it immediately You'll find thematic progressions in this but but I have begun this poem in order to see if I can if I can open up and eventually have some of these passages much more free of it uh uh I now uh uh
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 353.712 361.934 uh uh there is a kind of poem that I have never in my life been able to do and and and that really fascinates me a total form with with the uh I
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 362.271 373.762 is spri  it's just Williams' Spring and All And I see the later Williams is very much uh what I do do uh All the later Williams is thematically composed and and and and and uh uh
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 374.084 415.913 uh and and has a th  regular musical progression But in Spring and All there there i there is a sequence of  I don't know what is it Something like thirty two poems It's much more than you could ever compose except by your intuition So what uh  uh that's what I'm sort of going toward and yet uh certainly at the beginning of this poem you you won't find an opening yet I'm going to read as far as as as I have typed and and uh because this'll be the first time I've read these in public  this is the first time by the way I've read that H D poem in public and and uh uh so the previous time I was certainly wasn't ready for it I wasn't quite ready this time That  I I can't get  it's one of the few poems that I can't get my distance from I am uh  for me the poem is a distance not a 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A a 416.268 423.388 not an  a a feeling I mean that uh but my feeling is so mixed up with the feeling of the poem is the way I put it I know the distance is there in the poem
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 0.205 13.786 But but but she  I think that you  that she's designedly in a way wanting to be there Well wh wh  but and and laying claim uh It's one of the places where you began the Eupheries because you realized it's something you laid on you because it's not coming from this
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 14.643 32.644 but but that that so her gnomic will be Now I know more than you do you little twerp And and the and the rune will be  I mean  And and gnomic in Emily Dickinson does not mean she knows something It means something  also It  no the the language knows something she's not going to  I mean uh this is the way I I don't 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 33.246 38.114 she kno she knows plenty but that's not what we're enc enc encountered that's so strange nor what she encounters
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 38.533 48.53 She'll go into speak from something she knows but to bring us clearly to the place where we are at the rune and then the  and rune is to evoke runic
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 48.952 59.475 gnomic is some utterance that that that i is very close to enigma and i is different from s symbol eni Enigma is something that cannot be transferred into metaphor
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 60.39 62.246 So I'm talking about the metaphoric here
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 62.653 67.062 in good degree when I go through these themes that are constantly operating in metaphor
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 67.562 74.278 One of the things that draws her to him is that she also experiences him as e enigmatic They rearrive
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 74.59 81.302 and and refuse a as I sai  so we're in the presence of a no  a a a metaphor that can't be located
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 82.037 90.762 that we begin to realize is metaphorical because it has no location and meanwhile there is an eni  an absolutely gnawing annoying
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 91.256 94.941 a a a a necessity for a location somewhere So place
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 95.432 96.583 uh the unloo  uh
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 96.942 102.063 has a lot uh and v  is very telling here The sea for instance and over beyond there
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 102.575 104.592  in horizon and beyond horizon
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 105.125 110.111 uh uh are are not global as they are in in in uh uh
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 110.531 125.803 in Whitman Although she's got experien  she's  I think in the early poem she has she has several references Columbus encircling sea encircling the globe as such globe is there in her mind but not not when she's going over there not when she's going to another land or another place
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 128.228 140.748 Well this one little poem is not only  what I w wanted to speak about in the way of  though of her striking the gnomic and the rune both go by being very striking and she begins to have a language which is d  like Spencer's 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 141.465 142.762 Absolutely
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 143.615 146.878 j  her she has a tense that looks subjunctive
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 148.789 157.049 uh Yeah uh we'll find that And then she also ha  will will strike out on her own fo for the serpent's figure glid
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 157.496 158.636 stealthily along
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 159.783 164.844 No accident at all I've got I think two versions of this There there it is
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 164.911 176.772 featured terms are themselves terms standing not symbols standing for something that comes immediately into question on and and and and openly into question what does that mean
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 179.927 195.052 uh But now rune is the one that evokes this Rune evokes uh uh uh wh wh where where gno gnomic's um  a gnomic covers in some way Or or it's uh like a husk of something that you can't get at Rune is to call up
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 195.529 206.459 the the the thing is vis visitation to encount  to call up the encounter with the thing an and that is very frequent mode These are the modes in Emily Dickinson You find prayer
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 207.061 212.269 certainly in in in the terror and and and  I mean all her life she inhabited a uh

Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 308.636 314.201 in a sense no matter what school she went to the poem so invade every level that
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 314.963 325.38 that she is not making mistake when at You and I because I is the name of a person This is  that was  Susan observes a Me is Mark likely to be the one you heard that other book people

Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 341.748 357.598 thi  everybody has faces right They don't dream that she's not  I mean she she doesn't leave you room to think Oh she's made a slip or she did  or or for instance uh did she do it uh did she do it for rhyme there uh Canter um  and uh we'll take take a look at where  that was number ten was it
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A b 357.987 358.472 Hm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 358.23 358.934 Yes
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 359.856 361.755 No no way Mmmm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 362.721 369.111 No way absolutely just I Exclamation point uh i in case you missed the the You and I
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A c 370.622 376.655 Well uh uh uh actually she might be rhyming it with employ or she does it was her line
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 371.417 371.914 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A d 375.344 375.933 I 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 376.74 379.822 But me would've been an uh absolute rhyme for employ
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 382.304 383.111 and I is
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 383.759 395.117 a very jarring one indeed She likes jarring rhymes but me would've been a a  I mean not w  me would've been very typical of her employ and we know she's  it's I is the name of somebody because me is the name of somebody too for her
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 395.773 406.897 Now it's   so her shifters are re are real persons within the poetry This is what I've been  I get at an and and I don't mean that she thought a heavy trip around but she must've recognized what she was doing At You and I
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 0.151 9.283 x seem preposterous some of it but so I underl un beneath this there seems to be such a period of Emily's
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 3.677 5.591 Luckily 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 9.452 12.819 in which he emerges even freer than the x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 12.96 15.275 whereas people do go through that period
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 15.838 20.967 uh x I'm thinking about early structures that you actually go through that you can call upon x you know x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 21.31 23.904 after all you've got a x different kind of poetry x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 22.962 24.497 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 24.92 31.882 x certainly Pound did not go through some such structure because he just dismisses like an eighteenth century rationalist
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 32.16 38.023 Well that ends up with no atheism no god nothing like as if nobody's talking about it x so he's just across from it
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 38.212 48.609 x It's not accessible yet at a very later stage he wants to take up the subject The same happens with the economics with e Emily's x here
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 48.79 56.098 her intuitions are contemporaneous with Marx's I mean in Marx's case a whole politics and a whole economics is being built x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 56.3 63.428 but the underlying intuitions the underlying feeling that it permeates all life x which is different from x is is the x 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 63.54 71.384 that something permeates every level of your consciousness is not reductive and and and and and that it it
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 69.254 70.039 Right
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 71.56 75.028 and to say that it's the real thing is so so x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 74.833 75.487 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 76.932 77.768 It is
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 78.5 83.81 i i it becomes more and more amazing as you read her that she does have all 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 83.93 88.16  h her sensibility is so related to that of people working in
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 88.35 91.975 at the same time but in other places that she couldn't possibly have
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 92.44 94.411 read specifically x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 94.64 98.356 I I was amazed for example with x lines in her work
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 98.62 102.605 They're identical with lines in Christina Rossetti and
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 101.858 102.587 Ah yes
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 102.78 103.864 I would check
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 104.734 114.181 the  I checked the first time her  Christina Rossetti's poems were published and they weren't published until nineteen sixty two and a lot of the lines that are identi  I mean eighteen sixty two
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 111.39 114.32 x she's got no reference
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 114.295 115.283 Christina Rossetti x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 114.469 118.815 and there's there's no possible reference in x absolute identical lines
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 118.573 128.356 And she did have Emily Bronte's poetry she had the Brontes' poetry and and that's one of the  that's the book she sends to the publisher and he's he's overawed and sends it back to her because it was a first edition
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 120.373 120.923 Yeah
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 123.956 124.621 Yeah
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 127.519 128.069 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 128.628 142.811 Even then rare and much sought after uh but x this is the kind of thing where you do we x  we need to x scholar just to find x  to find the manuscript when we all look at the lines to find out how could she possibly write a Christina Rossetti poem
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 142.023 142.747 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 143.28 146.008 x there was this uh amazing x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 146.19 151.612 nucleus of wo women that were born all  almost a identical time there was Susan Gilbert
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 151.96 156.419 and they were born five days or something like that or a week apart or something like that and then
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 157.07 160.388 Helen Hunt Jackson was born a month
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 160.51 167.546 before and there's only four days actually between her and and Christina Rossetti and x born x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 165.744 167.162 x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 167.98 169.429 exactly the same time
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 168.508 173.179 And and we can s  turn around and say that the American household at the Amherst
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 173.43 176.285 College level and the Rossetti h household
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 175.619 177.324 Oh they're almost identical
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 176.232 182.376 They're that x  that close that we haven't got a separation in in in in the social but we can
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 180.45 181.088 Yeah
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 182.385 190.737 when we go to the Dickinsons we realize that that that what has disappeared in America is this English household that the Dickinsons Amherst's was
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 190.764 192.812 in English through and through and through
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 193.269 195.399 And so it was going to be just like England
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 195.62 198.164 not not not  it's hard to pose
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 199.136 205.892 that she were even x say that that your family were continually marrying and and and and English
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 206.14 214.864 just by race but but the American family is not English through and through and nor is the English family x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 211.916 212.479 Yeah
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 213.034 213.522 Yeah
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 219.87 223.141 Another little poem that I'll just x read a
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 223.23 224.5 x a short
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 225.1 227.54 quote from uh in the same kind of
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 228.04 230.974 sense of counting in the material world
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 231.59 233.217 and contrasting it with
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 233.77 237.951 another kind of infinity is poem sixty three which includes the line
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 238.18 240.718 it springs from winter's rise
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 240.934 242.458 can the anemones
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 242.738 243.987 be reckoned up
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 244.226 244.659 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 247.502 248.152 Mhm

Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 260.239 261.912 No it wasn't uh
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 262.994 264.025 x was
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 264.448 268.149 That as it is in there The two that are italicized  yeah okay x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 271.512 273.401 What x
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 273.66 275.733 Oh I was just saying that this is a
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 276.13 278.391 a a a place where that
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 277.977 279.851 Can't be counted up Yep
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 278.899 279.464  the
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 279.678 283.697  the two kinds of infinity are brought together and and and
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 281.178 281.734 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 284.46 285.227 uh
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 286.62 288.21 put into a relationship
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 288.841 289.698 and she
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 289.032 294.56 x infinity is is is diffuse but when it's the impalpable it means it's numbers
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 294.63 295.354 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 295.17 302.88 And numbers are not diffuse at all It means that numbers extend Remember the other picture we have is that there's a limit x and at the limit
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 302.962 309.433 we're at the point of diffusion but it but it  but the  the factory is x  they called it the sea by the way
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 304.08 304.789 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 309.78 317.64 But the sea here was that there was was a sea of the finite that the finite was infinite that the particular was i infinite
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 317.914 319.878 That's what they faced numbers
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 320.101 323.299 which were were x but just there
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 323.618 327.853 went all way up and and became a sea and undid the mind
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 328.022 329.948 but they called it
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 330.38 334.513 And Emily is amazing because she's always facing both of them
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 334.472 335.228 Mhm
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 335.272 336.129 Without
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 336.368 339.296 flinching really And then she she loves the

Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 341.05 347.542 and is ready to to look at  ready to look at each robin and each anemone in someone
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 347.235 356.224 Also immediate to it one of the one of the debilities of our period let's say a x head or mind for instance we x preSocratics
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 356.419 363.828 or or I'm still amazed a and yet that's okay that's my disposition I I've got the x why x Heidegger
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 363.97 379.361 so forth and so on fill my head full of them None of this makes my whole experience of this Emily keeps  Em  in Emily's library we do not find the preSocratics right around the corner We don't and so forth so that many of these things we experienced as initial
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 379.411 390.393 they're initial in me by the way I x I don't read Heidegger because it's Heidegger I read Heidegger because I recognize but meanwhile I have so complicated the picture that I've almost lost the immediacy of of
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 384.748 385.361 
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A a 391.47 400.665 the great thing going to that manuscript is x immediacies regardless of my theory but that's  that has to be taken back for us from Heidegger In in Emily's case some of the most
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A b 394.67 395.204 Mhm

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 13.945 18.695 It's a long poem which is to say a long poem for me a longish poem
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 20.541 21.701 For a long time
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 22.324 30.308 what I wanted to do more than anything else was to get poems shorter and shorter and shorter and then I discovered I was too successful I stopped writing completely
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 31.047 31.778 Ach
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 33.007 35.374 And silence was great but I wasn't happy with it

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 39.562 40.428 It's uh
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 40.984 50.556 it's a poem which I wrestled with for a long time and put away untouched and then I was asked very recently if I would contribute to a book intended primarily for children
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 51.661 54.632 And this sent me back to this poem again
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 55.374 57.225 which is a fairy tale poem
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 58.23 63.662 Those of you who know me at all know that one of the overwhelming interests of my life is fairy tales
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 64.935 74.353 and for many years I tried to turn my favorite horrific fairy tale which is called the Juniper Tree into verse I was totally unsuccessful at doing this
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 75.126 79.868 And I've ended up doing a b  a a fairy from an altogether different tradition
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 80.452 84.32 I'm happy that I have some Japanese friends in the audience tonight
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 84.987 87.084 because this poem is in fact
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 87.873 93.409 a poem based on an old Japanese fairy tale which is called Momotaro
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 94.218 95.64 or the Peach Boy
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 96.459 98.159 I don't know whether any of you here
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 98.627 99.295 know it
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 99.763 101.304 or many of you here know it
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 102.04 104.661 but it is a poem which always deeply moved me
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 105.438 108.369 Once many years ago I was set to learning Japanese
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 110.177 114.979 under the auspices of the United States Navy as a matter of fact and the only thing I read
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 115.476 121.581 of all the material that we went through in the process of learning Japanese that ever stayed in my head was this story
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 122.627 133.816 I could still hear it going in my head for instance The noise that the peach out of which the little boy comes makes as it turns over and over in the river donburi donburi donburi
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 134.671 143.328 I can hear the boy's mother talking to him as she loads him up with kibi dango millet seed cakes the best kibi dango in all Japan
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 143.932 146.013 and I can hear the animals who stopped him
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 146.44 152.816 I've forgotten all the military Japanese I ever knew I can't tell you the word for a battleship or a gun
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 153.174 164.261 or an emplacement or anything else but I can t  probably tell you this story in Japanese though all the rest of it is departed from me And I'd wanted to work it and rework it and I've tried
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 164.67 166.335 tried to find a form for it
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 166.885 175.242 And it finally occurred to me as I under  with this sic  you see it's a it's a long  it's only one poem I'm going to read so I have an excuse for a long introduction right
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 175.624 183.337 uh As I thought about the uh appropriate form for this poem I decided I would return to a very ancient and honorable form very flexible
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 183.748 185.588 and very beautiful doggerel
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 186.549 194.876 This is a poem which is written in doggerel I dearly love a rhyme I'll do anything in the world for a rhyme and I don't much care how fast or how slow
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 195.679 197.527 I get to it in the line
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 198.529 202.858 The interesting thing which happened to this story which originally had a happy ending
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 203.748 212.917 Peach Boy goes out and he goes to the Onigashima the island of the devils and he conquers the king of the demons devils whatever you call them monsters
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 213.407 224.554 and he comes back home makes his family happy and he lives happily ever after But as I wrote this poem I discovered that the ending of it insisted on changing and I couldn't finish it until I changed the ending
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 225.987 234.36 And this finally turned out then to be a poem not only about what I always thought it was about which is the impossibility of finding a proper name for everything
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 234.89 237.028 anything this is a poem about naming
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 237.556 240.539 But it also turned out to be a poem about heroism
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 241.127 243.48 an antiheroic poem
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 244.17 253.0 And I suppose the reason it became an antiheroic poem is because the language which I learned reading the story of the little Peach Boy I ended up using on the island of Iwo Jima
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 254.093 265.501 and too many bad connotations are connected with it Anyhow I think all children always know that the so called happy endings of fairy tales are lies
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 266.603 267.125 Right
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 268.316 280.499 But they understand that we're courteous enough to lie to them and pretend that we think they believe in us when we tell them that everybody lived happily ever after You'll see nobody lives happily ever after in this
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 282.284 290.689 It's divided into sections which are the parts of the story The first part of Momotaro or the Peach Boy then is called The Finding of the Peach
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 294.041 295.565 An old woodchopper

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 303.381 311.055 And the name of his wife was Wife and the name of the days they lived was Day and the name of the nights was Night
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 312.115 317.766 But the name of the sum of them all was Pain for they had borne no child to bear their name
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 318.791 321.683 Until crouched one day by the bank of the stream
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 322.246 329.07 washing her wash and dreaming her dream the old woman saw a giant peach afloat on the water just out of her reach
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 329.704 345.505 Over and over it turned and the sun singing a song or humming a hum donburi donburi reach out your hand what is borne in the water may live on the land what begins as a peach may end as a man so wet your feet
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 346.226 347.758 and catch what you can
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 348.951 353.686 Like a child she clutched it clutched at the peach something to fondle
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 354.099 358.093 or something to eat like a child she held it tight to her breast
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 358.615 365.384 but knowing no names how should she guess what to call it or what would come next Peach she called it
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 365.879 366.973 carrying it home
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 367.474 368.725 to where the old man
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 369.668 370.596 waited alone
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 371.638 374.297 Part two is called The Cutting of the Peach
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 375.151 376.882 I'll cut it said the old man
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 377.587 379.51 since cutting was his trade

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 245.768 248.538 And it's a poem about the United Nations
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 249.391 256.492 I  which I was construing as You've got to bring your imagination down to the ground and ground yourself so to speak Otherwise
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 256.892 259.675 you get um uh any kind of uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 260.239 263.102 fantasy monsters
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 263.794 268.461 monsters of reason monsters of imagination uh irrelevancies
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 268.75 274.084 plunging the imagination plunging on a butterfly He's mired on Mothra
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 274.362 275.345 That's the way it ends
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 275.175 279.72 And he ended it but he ended it with this gesture of butterfly a pismire Mothra
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A c 277.493 278.751 Oh okay
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 281.024 281.79 Certainly
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 281.337 283.34 And I said Oh I see He's just talking
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 283.369 285.336 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 284.114 284.924  Yes
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 285.206 288.502 This poetry's no different from somebody actually talking for real
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 288.9 294.374 And the reason I hadn't been able to read him is that my father's poetry and all the poetry I'd ever
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 294.743 295.321 read
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 295.678 300.752 was supposed to be somebody talking not for real or a different style than real conversation
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 301.177 305.133 It's like if he reads a sonnet or it's a literary sound or it's a
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 305.416 309.014 it's a pun or on uh somebody else's poem or
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 309.447 312.31 it has some stale wash of another poem over it
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 312.741 315.429 But this was just absolute straightforward
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 316.258 317.072 uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 318.309 325.396 well uh conversation I guess or declaration or speech But the poetry was identical with intense
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 325.848 329.671 fragments of spoken idiom as you might hear at Marseille himself
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 330.403 333.626 And that was the first time I'd ever heard of such a notion
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 334.062 335.537 that the poetry could be real
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 336.033 345.322 or that realit  that it could be somebody talking for real instead of making up a poem like or making up uh  making it up to look good
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 346.831 349.839 And I don't know what it was that uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 350.779 355.941 I could  I don't know how uh  if I could even you know describe what my idea of poetry was before
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 356.814 360.637 I said I was supposed it I didn't because I just never thought it out
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 361.088 364.888 But it had never occurred to me that could be identical with actual speech
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 365.709 370.999  and once I understood that then I could start reading them And I began reading it and and that really
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 371.991 373.204 blew my mind then
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 373.548 375.418 After that he I think was  he read
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 376.167 381.161 let's see uh uh Pure Products of America Go Crazy and that was very moving
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 381.379 381.939 Yeah
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 381.844 386.757 because I fin finally understood that it was nifty I thought that I could put the accent in this other style
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 387.514 391.832 and we degraded per his destiny about how hunger can feed itself
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 392.611 395.497 And then the interesting thing was when he had to make an imagination
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 395.933 396.667 of Heaven
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 397.353 403.38 or what he desired it was a real down to earth  it's a very common while he  while the 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 403.485 408.522 Imagination is strange enough that it feels overwrought and stifling and some kind
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 404.426 405.232 strange 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 407.735 414.574 with deer going  everything is strange after deer going by and fields were stuck with this this goldenrod and the stifling
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 413.618 416.846 Stifling he would sometimes  somehow it seems to his stride
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 415.494 416.047 Yeah
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 417.313 421.151 No one to witness and adjust no one to drive a car 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 418.477 419.633 Witness and adjust
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 420.599 422.082 That's right
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 422.321 423.288 So
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 423.106 423.79 Now
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 424.249 429.89 uh Once i once I got the idea that he was talking for real
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 430.386 435.248 and then he said something as straightforward uh as uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 436.519 442.987 that we got to eat shit I mean w uh what he was saying that the way we are living it's like we're eating shit instead of uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 438.366 438.832 Yeah
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 443.655 446.075 instead of our desire to seem 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 445.415 447.014 That's to the hunger too
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 446.534 447.145 yeah
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 448.664 449.216 uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 449.005 449.601 Notes
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 450.284 456.386 that seems really radical to me and amazing that anybody would be saying anything so
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 457.152 458.075 interior
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 459.049 460.008 and frank
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 461.063 463.636 and uh realistic
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 464.357 467.177 just like you'd think to yourself when you're alone in bed at night
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 469.005 470.328 and um
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 471.171 477.107 somehow that turned  that changed  it turned me around completely as far as what poetry was supposed to be
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 477.635 480.026 because before that I'd been writing rhymed verse
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 480.541 482.401 imitating uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 482.897 484.815 Sir Thomas Wyatt that poet
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 487.49 490.937 I assume that's sensing your office calves and those
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 491.533 493.466 It's not simply a depressed state of mind
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 493.802 495.575 but it's a sense that the um
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 496.498 499.718 that the resources of the terminations of the 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 500.068 501.18 common world the
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 502.106 506.686 have really been dis  disappointing to put it mildly in the sense that they used to uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 507.089 507.706 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 507.34 518.925 uh nothing more than hope to use to to to to either act to to to to to re to  fact and or hope might've  might  might've proven the case
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 519.427 521.725 uh Chris Weetabix has been talking uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 522.285 526.603 the group of uh  not that if a younger a bit of undergraduate class
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 527.513 532.026 rehearsing the the political events of the last  of yesterday particularly
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 532.56 533.192 and then
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 533.528 538.692 disposition for example Alan uh had a piece from the Boston Globe which has been doing a
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 539.178 540.253 an intensive
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 540.777 543.895  investigatory business on the uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 544.502 551.11 uh sources of information of the FBI and the FBI had had obviously bee  had pulled back from
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 551.716 555.255 uh using its own people and covered uh uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 555.812 559.039 uh illegal uh uh information
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 559.409 560.223 This is it
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 560.665 568.917 And apparently it's got a whole sort of uh almost one wants to say a subculture of uh eager beavers and voluntary uh uh uh people 
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 568.511 570.117 Vigilante yeah
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 569.451 573.248 yeah Vigilante groups that are practically doing the same uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 573.589 580.742 investigations aforementioned uh all all illegal but not constituting uh you know federal developments of common agency
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 573.722 574.369 Funny
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 581.116 584.02 Anyhow we're talking about this book and this I'm talking about the
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 584.361 595.229 Sandinistas and could one think of it as simply good guys versus bad guys and Alan had seen them repeating in the s  in the  on the b the bathroom uh just uh moments ago that said If you
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 595.689 617.344 if you like uh Cuba you'll really  love Nicaragua  Saying that uh you know would that  the  Nicaraguan government were were simply sweetness and  light just yeah But in fact it is a very  you know it's a it's a it's a very uh one one party government with very determined attitudes and and very real senses of uh of social conduct being you know
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 599.132 599.997

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 622.62 627.529 Yeah really really very determining of certain conflicts instead of a sort of now that I think other
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 628.022 640.086 thinking of the Israeli college uh standing in business But I was thinking it's bleak indeed these days It was obviously bleak in Williams's time equally to think of what you could propose as a viable and uh
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 640.965 646.953 consequent world for these imaginations and or the practical violence up and beyond two hundred words forever
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 647.429 650.786  I felt that ending One time I'd fallen for that with two visits

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 786.835 789.582 One was what was his fight with T S Eliot

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 799.137 806.484 at their invitation at somebody's private house So he took me along because we had a wiener date and he said Would you like to go there
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 807.025 807.65 So
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 808.072 809.932  it was just a little
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 811.257 815.921 trying  it was a small uh poetry circle from the local Jersey retro scene
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 816.951 825.097 And I asked  uh first I asked  I was asking him for a long poem what kind of rhy  or rhythm what kind of rhythm or what kind of uh first line

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 830.386 831.207 That's helpful
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 831.193 838.787 Was sort of like in Pound or in uh more like uh  he did it what he did in Patterson and what he was doing then in Patterson

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 844.313 848.582 some x lines some short short lines balance
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 849.166 851.848 but he was saying for a long poem in the twentieth century
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 852.644 855.937 uh uh uh a great number of different first forms
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 856.194 860.371 um bro uh broken up uh you know you're broken for lies up within the
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 860.799 864.549 the uh m monotonous uh single first line
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 865.315 865.962 then
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 867.016 870.969 I said What is it uh  wh why don't you like the azaleas What is it
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 871.965 873.142 because he had said
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 874.027 880.337 he said he'd written a night he'd said that again to me that uh Eliot was such a genius that he'd set up all American poetry back
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 880.774 884.118 twenty years I said what  what'd you mean by that
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 881.793 882.789

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A b 931.88 933.275  Without knowing anyone
Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 932.636 933.98 and presumptuous

Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88 A a 948.491 951.689 um Johnsonian character Johnsonian um uh
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 0.131 1.105 Feels good
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 1.541 10.513 that joy lasts as long as your walk through the city and dissolves when you return home to your work to ho how far there is left to go with it
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 15.061 21.703 In the fall of nineteen ninety seven I moved into a two bedroom fat  flat just up the street from my previous residence
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 22.221 24.001 though here everything was different
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 24.51 30.491 Now I had one roommate instead of three which meant I could occupy the living space less anonymously
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 31.274 41.309 The reason I at times experience certainty that I started this book in the summer of nineteen ninety eight is that through the window of this new bedroom I saw my first concrete tree
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 41.801 48.32 I was struck by what I thought was an anomaly until I began seeing this type of tree all over that unique city
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 49.245 56.832 Within the first few sentences of the novella after that you will find the concrete tree outside my window written quite simply
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 57.251 66.502  Years later I would have to rewrite that passage as too many people unfamiliar with the concept concrete tree worried over its incongruous presence
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 67.09 82.025 A few months ago I addressed this concern by changing the text to The trees outside my window are the first in a series of architectural leaps intended to beautify this city these saplings protected by cylindrical holes of concrete
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 83.021 94.011 To those of you who also lived in this great cement city I apologize for such an overt description but there are certain things one cannot understand as o  if one has never seen them
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 94.735 104.201 For instance it never snowed in my previous city the city of the novella yet today it is late March in my new city and flurries blow past the window
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 104.574 110.963 I have called Chubby to tell her this and she sputters What what wrapping her mind around the concept
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 112.352 125.974 This is what you do when you're editing isn't it You move text around you delete something that does not have the anticipated effect on your trial reader You write down somewhere that you have deleted that thing then you put a question mark beside it
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 126.612 141.069 How many times have I been thrown into confusion when explaining to someone the cuts I've made that person being different from the trial reader and that person has responded with a violent shake of the head pressing the point I totally understand that Put it back in
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 141.943 155.09 The number of times I have done that matches the number of times I have run to a nearby park thrown myself on a bench and fallen over with my head in my lap my hands scraping the ground with the smallest of smiles on my face
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 155.799 158.673 Confusion is a gift I have always thought
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 159.209 161.217 That is the reason for the smile
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 161.899 172.049 Similarly when I am in the midst of an overwhelming sadness those moods that have no identifiable cause I begin to marvel over the ability to have such feelings
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 172.38 182.893 I write something down usually on a loose sheet of paper thinking the feeling's too fleeting for my diary and give that smile again buried in the typical frown of sadness
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 183.317 185.394 Because what I've written is beyond me
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 186.442 195.496 Eventually one comes to know what belongs in a book one is writing and what does not and eventually one changes one's mind on all of this
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 196.531 219.419 I finished the final version of the novella after that sometime late summer two thousand and three after two extensive rewritings and probably two less intense reworkings and countless line and paragraph edits plus two shelvings and one almost utter shredding and then I ran outside The relief I felt was tremendous though ultimately short lived
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 220.02 227.116 You have finished your novella I told myself You have made a place for it I was in my new city when I said this
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 227.969 236.507 I had changed cities because I could not stand to see the demise of my old one though I was aware that I had been living in its entrails for some time
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 237.043 247.847 But I do not think I need to reiterate my reasons for blinding myself to that reality As it goes I moved many places at first then finally settled on this new one
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 248.491 260.575 Why am I here I asked myself walking among its thousands of ghosts I could not find an answer but in the interim I met a girl and became enamored with her She will be referred to as M
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 262.043 269.269 I showed the novella to M once she had read my other work and upon finishing it she said Hm studying me
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 269.702 288.171 We were in a very large park I think she turned her head to see if this park mirrored the one referred to in the novel I didn't write it here I explained it to her She did not appear to believe me Well people will think what they want It is their right I suppose But After That could never have been written in this city
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 288.973 312.115 I wrote it in a place of perpetual sun a place that never rose above thirty degrees Celsius I've given up Fahrenheit in protest of the government It never sank below ten A place of crowds that did not overwhelm one as they do here A place whose incomparable ease explains the near flatness of the writing this flatness which I could never alter and always haunted me
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 313.224 317.916 That first summer in my new city the sensation of my own flatness was very strong
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 318.287 321.889 With M in the park I was struck by the persistence of it
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 322.226 329.222 this feeling which I thought had rid   I had rid myself of by simply maturing as a person had never left me
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 329.657 336.033 It had just taken on another form manifesting itself differently yet deep deeper with every subsequent book
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 336.621 355.97 It strikes often at the end of the day when I'm reviewing some work I have just written and I find myself thinking that it is not writing that I have done It is speech or air plain air It is zero It is a gesture a sign an indication of writing but not writing Not at all writing
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A a 0.207 7.502 Nowadays I'm more or less content to let a lot of things take their own courses like amiable rivers making blue lines down the map of history
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A a 7.983 16.19 I'm not saying that some things don't infuriate me They certainly do But I've learned mostly through stupid repetition the same patience I apply to my own works
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A a 16.56 31.226 Moving them out of range of good and evil is applicable in a romantic way I guess to things natural and unnatural Outside myself I'm on better terms though still able to bear grudges with most things and people more social socially amiable
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A a 31.842 37.237 no longer stand in a corner at parties facing into the wall smelling the school like plaster getting plastered
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A a 37.683 42.343 Now I talk it up and even when down never talk down but remain subdued

Halpern-Rob_Complete-BPC-Segue_3-3-07 A a 324.662 338.051 and I'm pointing out beyond the docks out to rock on the horizon as if the thing out there were already in here with us screaming something I'm not doing there

Halsey-Alan_Complete-Reading_BUS-MFA_Boise_10-15-10 A a 71.115 72.149 and it me meant that 
Halsey-Alan_Complete-Reading_BUS-MFA_Boise_10-15-10 A a 72.721 78.006 what I have to do all the time is to sort of look for the specific density of a poet's language and once you've found that

Halsey-Alan_Complete-Reading_BUS-MFA_Boise_10-15-10 A a 82.581 89.948  And with some poets even quite quite difficult poets y you can find that specific density quite quickly wi With Coleridge

Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 24.978 26.764 and she says he turned pale
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 27.306 28.231 But he left
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 28.741 33.83 Time and again he left and when he came back it's called coming back home
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 34.232 36.531 After a few months or whatever time
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 36.9 38.715 they'd get along until they didn't
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 39.589 41.346 We moved all over Texas
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 41.728 45.89 never more than six months in a place Usually it was closer to three or four
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 46.201 48.341 And they fought wherever they were together
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 48.872 67.682 so I never made any friends that lasted and everything was various depending on whether it was just my mother and me or whether my father was there and whether they were trying to run a restaurant together or whether my mother was working as a waitress Do you know that breakfast shift dinner shift swing shift vocabulary
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 68.159 74.562 Or there was a once when she worked in a candy factory coating chocolates and putting the identifying little swirl on top
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 75.206 80.718 What I remember most often is that we were just the two of us living in a bedroom in somebody's house
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 81.036 83.854 and my mother's salary would run ten dollars a week
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 84.23 88.416 and the room plus board for me and the landladies looking after me would run seven
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 89.235 91.462 I don't mean to make this sound pathetic
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 92.012 96.163 At some time during that when I was five I started school
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 96.633 98.079 and I was a whiz
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 98.56 102.266 I went through the first and second grade the first year
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 102.62 106.294 and I went through the third and fourth grade the second year
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 106.703 113.426 and the third year when I was seven I was in the fifth grade and broke my arm twice so I got slowed down
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 119.068 121.303 That would've been when we were in Mineral Wells
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 121.976 131.921 My father was with us then and we were living in a three room house with a yard and honeysuckle on the porch at the bottom of a hill that's notable for a line of twenty foot high block letters
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 132.28 137.458  filled with regular light bulbs that in the night glared out Welcome towards the highway
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 138.138 139.584 I loved that sign
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 140.035 143.528 It felt like being in church to stand at the base of those letters
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 144.678 147.479 Just to finish that part of the story
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 147.978 150.053 the next year we went to New Mexico
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 150.585 154.525 and I went from being a whiz to passing the sixth grade conditionally
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 155.199 157.686 I was a kind of house dummy thereafter
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 158.125 161.256 I don't remember whether I had any notion of what went wrong
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 161.793 163.738 It feels like years of chaos
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 164.606 167.339 My father finally truly left around then
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 167.884 173.821 We sat in my Aunt Thelma's house south of Albuquerque and he roamed in the night around the house yelling Nora
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 174.295 178.532 And my uncle Everett would yell back Nora doesn't want you anymore
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 178.995 181.005 and I've got a twenty two here
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 181.396 183.74 and my father finally left for good
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 184.478 187.138 But while I feel like that has to be told somehow
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 187.514 190.023 these few pages going the way they've gone
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 190.518 192.342 what I really want to mention
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 192.711 195.712 and it took me until yesterday to get it into the air
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 196.052 202.093 is that all that time penned right from the first reading was my darling pleasure
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 204.805 205.361 Ha
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 212.259 213.011 
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 213.568 214.103 
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 233.034 237.358 There was a running set of lies that got handed to me all the time I was growing up
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 238.067 243.024 Whenever issue number one came up all the women's faces changed and all the girls were lied to
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 243.752 247.367 I realize it was a conservative's and protective device
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 247.772 250.816 but at my end of it it added up to a lot of confusion
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 251.352 255.741 For instance my fourteenth birthday was marked by my first visit to a dentist
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 256.163 260.772 Dentists are on hard times in West Texas where the water has natural fluoride
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 261.112 267.969 My mother's nearing sixty and has had three fillings all her life long and she got those because she moved away from Texas
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 269.965 276.465 Anyway at the time I'm talking about we were living in York Pennsylvania to be near my stepfather before he went off to war
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 276.927 278.864 and it was my fourteenth birthday
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 279.161 281.604 and I was going to the dentist for the first time
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 281.995 290.352 and the bo  a boy who was maybe sixteen was going to come to the apartment later and formally ask my parents if he could take me on my first official date
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 290.869 295.005 They had agreed that he could ask so it seemed likely the answer was yes
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 296.01 297.629 While I was at the dentist's
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 297.98 306.582 my mother started to show Dutch the presents I had got from my friends three or four small things one of which was the classic five year diary
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 307.329 310.038 which fell open when she laid it down
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 310.378 314.565 to what I had immediately written in on receiving it so as not to forget
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 315.297 323.228 The entry was The week before in the movie house with my friends I had kissed the boy who was due to arrive around four this afternoon
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 323.864 328.236  It was there in black and white with ecstatic exclamation marks
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 328.825 332.838 That entry proved to be the first and last of that possibility
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 333.375 337.005 One thousand eight hundred and twenty four days down the drain
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 339.319 341.076 Precluded by stupidity
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 341.689 349.243 I had taken the abstraction of my diary as an allowance proof against getting hoisted on the hook because you wrote it down
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 349.613 351.681 the power of a defined occasion
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 352.285 357.241 And I learned the way it really was when I got back from the dentist and faced those two faces
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 357.591 360.057 me the birthday girl and them the tribunal
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 360.563 362.775 There was no doubt that I had made a mistake
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 363.631 366.032 My mother took me into the kitchen to talk to me
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 366.559 368.548 Kissing in the movies is vulgar
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 369.559 370.68 but worse than that
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 371.115 372.735 and she rang the shift on me
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 373.61 376.437 No girl should kiss a boy until they're engaged
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 378.885 380.114 I couldn't believe it
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 380.738 381.902 that she was saying that
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 382.712 383.804 I looked at her
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 384.182 390.291 and she looked as solemnly back as if she meant to stand by that statement against come what may
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 393.518 394.914 I just lost my place
Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A a 397.576 400.512 I couldn't believe it I mean she came off a farm

Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 121.91 126.761 and this is what the situation is on on a a sheet of oh  you know two sides
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 126.99 129.902 Okay but it  the poem doesn't end til that line
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 130.24 131.65 Alright um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 132.99 137.18 This line at the bottom here's one of these two line things that
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 137.333 139.574 to me are very important
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 139.785 140.257 I
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 140.35 142.533  again I mean I don't know
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 142.61 144.32 if she ran out of paper
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 145.41 149.039 or could she have said  why did she not say
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 149.76 153.759 Well I ran out She does line things up very carefully
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 154.29 160.728 But why does she not start he must pass the crystal angle over on that page and let this go down
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 160.96 163.324 What decision where that decision come
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 163.34 167.807 but whatever ha has happened you are left with he must
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 168.0 170.826 pass the crystal angle that obscure her face
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 170.97 174.69 which to me is a completely fantastic
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 174.869 176.57 line  two lines
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 176.717 177.537 and break
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 179.71 185.211 And it's a he now remember her sweet um t  her sweet turn to leave the homestead 
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 185.689 188.283 He must pass the crystal angle
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 188.4 190.292 that obscure her face
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 190.904 191.585 and then
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 192.1 194.512 up there he must have achieved in
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 194.62 196.841 person equal paradise
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 197.37 199.662 and then all those variants
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 201.029 201.747 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 202.68 204.797 and then that's the end of that poem
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 204.878 205.895 but um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 207.828 209.989 he must pass that cr x  the crystal
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 210.36 213.984 angle is is just  I can't get to the bottom of that line
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 214.362 215.011 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 216.8 219.925 It x has x obviously somewhere
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 220.15 221.94 reference to Revelations but but
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 222.22 225.463 I think that it's very important that there's a cross
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 226.02 227.59 over the word angle
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 229.29 233.984 Now you can go back and figure out and Johnson will show you what should go there but
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 234.75 237.381 uh I don't  to me that's not important
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 239.834 240.525 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 241.016 241.782 Let me just
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 242.095 243.732 thinking of x uh
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 244.18 247.78 distance be her  oh x  distance be her only motion
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 248.347 250.208 is a beautiful  that's another
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 250.37 253.392  now you see there with these crosses I don't know
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 253.48 256.386 distance be her only motion
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 257.63 260.61 x d don't you feel that there's some
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 262.842 265.911  I don't know x asking her something
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A d 266.136 268.623 That's what I thought x that's what I think
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 266.176 269.079 x um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A d 270.594 272.803 Like she might not be consistent either
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 271.127 271.808 Usually
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 272.619 276.62 No I don't think they x  see I I don't  I mean I think if you're looking for any kind of
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 276.81 281.151 answer or consistency you'll never find it I mean that's what x she's again  that's what she's
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A d 277.228 280.029 x yes x right
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 281.309 282.476 completely against
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A d 281.372 281.885 Yes
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 283.195 284.138 But um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 285.63 291.492 and that demurral all the things that demure I mean a demure woman but a demure
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 291.59 293.11 is both refusal
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 293.344 294.009 and
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 295.1 298.915 you know o okay I would do it It's it's two different things
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 299.671 300.309 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 300.82 306.149 The whosoever she's  she repeatedly used whoso and whosoever in this x
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 306.872 308.686 um  and then
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 309.6 311.565 there there's this short poem
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 311.862 312.81 after it
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 312.96 314.884 pain has an element of blank
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 315.41 319.944 One of my students um wrote a really interesting paper on
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 320.32 322.46 on Dickinson's use of blanks
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 322.59 324.592 Of just blanks in Dickinson
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 324.878 325.89 and um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 326.956 330.722 blanks as being charged things and um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 331.575 332.469 I mean I think that
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 332.57 337.66 this way of printing the poems and looking at the at the at  at the poems really
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 339.13 343.51 x very much shows  I mean that's true and that's really uh
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 344.25 347.041  then I love that new periods of pain
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 347.43 351.15 and then day the word day because you know when you're terribly depressed
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 351.93 355.217  you wake up and it's another day it's just another  you know
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 355.733 356.446  I think that
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 356.531 359.873 it's beautiful way that day is just fitting in at the bottom
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 359.961 361.165 and then the line
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 361.246 364.84 kind of spreads along after it rather than really under it
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 365.456 366.126 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 366.89 370.096 The three little crosses at the top were made by someone else
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 370.564 371.282 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 372.79 374.116 You know as as a marking
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 374.525 375.206 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 375.38 379.828 Another student  I had this minister who was in my class at Temple this year
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 380.01 382.441 and uh he he made this wonderful statement
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 382.552 385.37 work of Emily Dickinson is covered with crosses
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 385.886 388.07 and and I thought that was just gorgeous
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 388.227 388.903 and x
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 389.47 395.965 it is I mean not only are  is it covered with these crosses but it's covered with crossings and crosses that you don't know where
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 396.753 397.961 where you are
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 398.24 400.1 or what you  where you should be
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 400.671 402.746 um Any  anybody want to
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 402.892 404.743 say anything about any
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A e 405.084 406.352 I would x
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 405.992 406.587 Yeah
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A e 406.613 412.623 x the same x handwriting
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 407.817 409.267 I c  yeah
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 412.64 414.79 No they w  they're really  I mean
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 415.34 416.65 they they're very different
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 417.42 424.41 and they're not just plain dashes and sometimes commas look like dashes and sometimes the top of T's like up here
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 424.639 426.468 um This is like
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 426.837 430.733  these are sort of like x those see what I mean
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 432.477 436.139 And then they  x when you when you start um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 436.52 440.47 really x I don't know how x Dickinson because when you start worrying about it
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 440.831 445.334 see with how much space she leaves between poems x becomes a big
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 446.08 447.984 x to me it becomes a big issue
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 448.142 450.393 and then I wonder am I just
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 450.885 452.335  is this silly I mean
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 453.049 457.536 is it a mystery or isn't it x and then but the worst issue is the dashes
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 458.25 460.457 and I just  I think that um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 461.207 462.833 you x are really
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 463.108 469.058 the way to do it The ideal way to do anything x poem on one side and x printed uh
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 469.345 476.533 you know a x  a transcription on the other side But I think you would x  you know you would try to match those dashes
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 477.311 480.879 in the directional pull the way she does but you couldn't really
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 481.074 486.446 Anyways you've missed something You could never you see you couldn't cross T's like that
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 486.498 490.787 And this little mark here you couldn't x well here's
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 491.659 492.249 um
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 493.93 497.696 This is the x  we're sort of like um so much summer is on the
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 499.11 501.885  that'll be  that would be on the end of of
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 502.88 505.101 the series that I've just been talking about
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A c 504.466 505.458 x slides
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 506.31 506.803 Huh
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A c 506.509 512.181 We had the x but they both jammed in the printer and that caused the uh x got them out Want them
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 508.655 509.902 Yeah x
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 511.256 511.851 Okay
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 512.121 512.716 No
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 512.8 517.023 x just x I x I wouldn't dare try anything x and I think
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A c 515.564 518.239 Well if we could get x would be alright to x
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 517.923 524.206 But would  but look at this poem here x  I'm sorry it's so dim now but look at the crossed T's on this one
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 524.62 525.643 So much summer
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 525.89 527.541 me for showing illegitimate
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 527.9 530.515 Illegitimate alone on the line there
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 530.94 534.617 would a smile's minute bestowing too exorbitant
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 534.88 536.527 to the lady with the guinea
Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90 A a 536.724 537.964 This is one of these poems
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 0.23 5.67 Feels like home to me I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 6.097 7.44 Can everybody hear me alright
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 8.02 8.444 Okay
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 9.05 9.506 um
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 9.71 18.23 I'm going to read in two parts I'm going to read first from the new book lost parkour psalms and then I'm going to read some new amulet sonnets
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 19.71 20.637 So
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 21.239 27.35 um this book lost parkour psalms is is just out in France and it's a dual edition
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 28.007 32.7 in French and in English Th th  separate books but out at the same time
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 33.531 38.181 and in the title ps psalms within psalms alms
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 38.436 39.587 is in parentheses
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 40.327 44.47 And about parkour I just wanted to say that it's an activity
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 44.72 47.42 or a practice of moving rapidly
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 47.58 53.217 usually through an urban setting as would a stunt person be moving
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14 A a 53.439 58.11 and so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks

Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 164.172 166.201 aloud to to people So
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 166.659 180.31 uh now I have to again give you some backstory here uh There was  there's a film that came out uh in New York i It it was  appeared uh at a couple of theaters and it had a short run um a few months ago
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 180.964 183.055 uh called An Unfinished Film
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 184.093 184.397 
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 184.667 193.594 And uh the occasion of the film was that some footage from the Warsaw Ghetto was unearthed no one knew about
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 194.524 198.693 And uh and I f  I'm forgetting the name of this director
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 199.552 201.449 utterly brilliant director She
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 201.996 207.378 took this footage and put together this amazing film with voiceover and so on
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 208.071 215.668 uh And so this is a poem about watching that film Now let me just tell you if you don't know about the film it's not like um
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 216.27 220.557  it's not like the the um film footage of uh Theresienstadt
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 221.319 226.342 and uh maybe some people don't know what Theresienstadt was but during World War Two
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 226.779 227.887 the Germans
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 228.696 229.977 created a
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 230.669 235.693 er a f a fake or a mock u uh not  well no  a a fake uh
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 236.15 237.334 concentration camp
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 237.895 238.982 and they
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 239.624 250.588 they filmed everybody there and the people looked well fed and they were doing interesting things and they were happy These these were the Jews who had been brought from o  elsewhere in Europe and placed there
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 251.02 254.185 and it was you know it was kind of like a propaganda thing you know
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 254.807 258.634 um Well An Unfinished Film the person who
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 259.077 261.016 devised this this film
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 261.585 279.448 um had a ver  had something very different in mind because rather than just have it  well I mean I think initially they wanted it  the Germans wanted it to be for publicity but they kind of went a little too far or they really got too involved because it's clear from the from the found footage 
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 279.832 286.697 and by the way there's like a second camera and there may have even in  at certain points been a third camera so like the second camera will
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 287.646 289.924 show the first cameraman filming
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 290.353 297.568 the inhabitants of the ghetto who are being made to act in certain sc in certain scenes that have been uh orchestrated
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 298.108 298.392 
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 298.727 303.906 uh and uh and in fact one of the cameramen was found and was interviewed for the film
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 304.544 312.654  And there are people who survived the Warsaw Ghetto who are also  they they're filmed watching the footage and then making comments about it
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 313.285 314.13 and uh
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 315.387 320.104  we well so so so the scenes are  and this is like early in the Warsaw Ghetto
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 320.581 354.84 so there are people who have uh been brought there from all over you know And some of these people have more money than than others and you know So I mean you see p  you see bodies lying in the street It's not that the Germans are not trying to show that but what they decided to do was to show that and then show the way people reacted to that kind of thing So they'll have people  they'll they'll do twenty takes of people who are sort of well dressed and also poor people walking around a body that's lying on the sidewalk Or a bakery and there's a couple of things in the window and they'll show the
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 355.208 360.013 the really raggedy people looking at  looking through the window and then they they parade
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 360.442 361.737 the well shod
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 362.171 367.448 Jews in you know as if they're going to buy something and they do tha  you know you see one take after another
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 367.787 377.148 so w  I think what happen  you know the surmisal is that somebody eventually realized that uh this film was was a little too revealing
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 377.542 379.564 and it does say something about
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 380.527 386.449  uh what you know a s  a  uh perhaps a need to shame people rather than just uh you know
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 387.038 388.153 kill them you know
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 388.837 391.316 So anyway this is this is my uh
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 392.935 394.514 poem about that film
Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A a 394.887 400.891 and uh it  I don't know if anybody knows the poetry of Hugh Seidman but he writes these very terse

Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 267.988 270.854 in a in a effort to make it come back to life again
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 270.68 271.179 Right
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 271.311 271.735 but
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 272.0 277.91 the voice like can  it's like a reading voice to x and it just sounds like the the voice
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 275.194 275.731 True
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 278.03 282.072 isn't the voice of a person is it really alive and that's x
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 280.345 280.93 No
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 282.237 283.724 it slowed down last night
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 283.685 284.27 Right
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 284.248 287.552 and x I know they must have been ringing through his head
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 286.914 287.584 Sure
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 287.66 289.592 in that strange manner
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 289.85 293.185 which he really x didn't x  didn't you find the x
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 293.51 294.094 Yeah
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 294.085 297.906 x for example x and I were reading this radio play together
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 298.07 299.515 uh two days ago
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 299.96 302.099 and one paradox that she noted
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 302.588 307.5 I came out and say well w what do you think it sounded like since she has the socalled profess  no she has the actual professional
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 307.52 309.745 knowledge of that whole x
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 310.299 310.809 so
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 311.27 315.296 I was thinking do you think it was okay I mean she would just mail it and I don't want to listen to it again you know
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 315.497 315.921 
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 315.647 319.641 So you know anyhow she said yeah but x and she noted what was curious to her was that
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 319.91 321.53 there's a section of this play in which
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 322.54 326.251 one of the people speaking is is reading production notes
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 327.029 329.382 for the actual performance of the socalled play
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 329.788 330.298 and
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 330.541 332.75 that's part of the play is reading these notes
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 333.004 333.989 and the point is that
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 334.47 346.531 I was x  I was reading those notes and she said what was funny was that when you were reading those notes you were you were x like you sounded like someone not really reading notes but your voice became very relaxed and x you were reading notes to me
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 347.116 348.062 When you were reading
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 348.15 351.957 the parts that were proposed as conversational interchange
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 352.005 355.7 those were the parts that went peculiarly stilted and and not that you'd
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 356.295 358.255 you know fuck them up entirely but
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 358.33 361.613 those were the parts that didn't sound in that relaxed x
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 360.814 361.623 
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 361.78 367.404 And one  again one damn dilemma as a writer or as a poet more accurately hopefully is that
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 367.58 373.035 how to get the context to be that x in what you're reading so that the voice comes through x same way
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 375.35 379.383 Because reading something has x possibilities well as  otherwise
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 379.146 381.312 Yeah well I realized at your reading
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 381.66 383.95 at that  it got into that cozy sense
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 384.25 387.022 Well see I was x yeah
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 384.657 389.303 of being just  being read to which is very soothing and relaxing
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 389.221 393.881 I love that sense I suppose one of the real imprints on my own socalled consciousness would be the
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 389.815 390.384 x
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 394.03 397.389 being read to as a kid which was a beautifully x moment
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 396.174 396.802 Mhm
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 397.609 400.61 and also the sense which I've always been shy of but I've always
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 400.791 404.042 truly hungered for is the reading where you're reading to four to five
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 404.098 405.078 six friends
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A d 404.873 405.526 Uh huh
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A a 405.61 408.112 So that the residence is a completely uh
Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A e 409.167 412.196 clear  not clear but they really  have a really you know that
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 0.263 0.935 um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 1.634 3.421 uh It'll tell you a little bit about
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 4.439 5.083 um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 5.76 12.048 w when I come up against impediments and and um  which is often and then what I do about them
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 12.43 14.397 or at least how I did about them in this case
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 15.15 15.759 um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 16.134 20.057 I hadn't written for a long time and I uh had uh wrote uh 
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 20.514 24.653 um a thing a text you know words on a page um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 25.408 27.229 and I thought it was appalling
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 27.555 33.711 You know sort of dead and uninteresting and uh I'm sort of insulted by all this
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 34.088 38.693 reference to nature which you know doesn't seem to be very appropriate anymore
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 39.109 43.111 on and on You know self lacerating space that I live in and um 
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 43.555 53.65 uh and uh but I was desperate to get something new um and um  because one gets very tired of one's work
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 54.1 57.833 um And uh  so I needed something new
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 58.807 59.666 um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 60.67 63.336 So I did something which was um 
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 65.272 69.994  I'm interested in  as I said today in in Charles' class I'm interested in the
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 70.427 88.268 the the idea of language as a set of examples um and that its its best way of of proceeding is by uh coming up with one example or another u um uh and I guess when I think of the example as as something that is both
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 88.671 96.219 possibly typical or or um common  in common and something that's also equally an exception
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 96.663 97.14 um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 97.874 98.746 So
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 99.083 105.059 uh one of the places  of course one of the very best places to find an example is um in um
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 105.487 106.457 the dictionary
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 106.955 112.519 uh because it's full of all these definitions  Bet you didn't know that And uh
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 112.907 122.651 so um  so what I did was I I have this uh wonderful little concise uh OED that I've had for at least twenty five years
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 123.077 131.36 uh and um you know how the a  what th what the diction  I'm really giving you my secrets here You understand this uh
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 131.724 145.132 y You know how you'll have a word and then it will just show you the way it's used but they won't say the word again because it would take up too much room So they give you the the example of its use
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 145.736 162.836 So what I did was in the proce  I took this narrative thing that I'd written and I started breaking it up and what I did was that there was  there would be a word and what I would do is find find these examples and uh sometimes keep the words and sometimes erase the word Everyone's leaving Is it just sort of tiresome
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01 A a 163.539 165.395  Bye

Mirakove-Carol_Complete-Reading_New-reading-Series_a-Voice-Box_10-18-09 A a 305.437 327.46 In any case I'm still going to go ahead  with the project and I'm going to read  um one poem that's a translation of uh an excerpt from a book by a poet named Florencia Walfisch who is a year older than me living in um Argentina and she went to um Oaxaca in ninety seven at the age of twenty seven and

Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 280.345 287.73 The leaves large for so small a tree moved one against the other in the deep green air
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 288.272 292.453 And the light amid bays and inlets of the leaves rippled
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 292.862 298.95 where the ripe figs hung purple in that green pool almost bursting
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 299.418 301.394 in the cool water of the air
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 303.031 305.141 It was fearful to plunge
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 305.738 309.462 Although all summer's rightness hung there
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 309.951 315.5 In the deep pool it moved rippling in the muscular light and shade
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 316.11 317.396 And it was fear
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 317.884 327.436 in its multiple saying forms the rank rightness of the fig swelled out and abandoned fearful to reach to

Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 336.557 341.628 and I saw in your eyes still in that pool of air
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 342.14 347.124 the livid bruise of the same indifferent fall
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 353.368 354.172 The Hawk
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 356.771 369.845 The hawk's cry from the tall sky fell but my hazel eye against a blue and lidless eye was set My stare went only into blue distance wastes of air
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 370.187 374.356 each augury of Hell invisible to my sense
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 376.574 380.809 There was an eagle set on a molding book in the attic
Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A a 381.478 388.76 Full of moth holes he was yet terrible in my childhood I pulled his feathers but they stuck

Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 2.652 3.891 Is something the matter
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 4.91 7.421 Of course the last minute revisions said
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 7.905 16.68 Of course if you A if you have an imaginative memory memory I may be creating a clearer picture of Helena than I actually saw or perhaps even overstating my first impression of her
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 17.008 26.324 That it means that over the course of my life I've encountered certain faces that unlike the ever millions that pass by form a clear and permanent image in my mind
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 26.71 33.934 A few such faces blind the people who I only met once others to strangers and then of course still others to my closest friends
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 34.526 41.391 I can still see Helena's face as though she were sitting right here in front of me questioning me with the look she wore so often
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 41.823 46.612 I never saw this look nor the essence of her face captured successfully in a photograph
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 46.98 49.941 so it was her movements and changes that made her remarkable
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 50.707 56.166 She was it turned out exquisitely dependent on the transient energy of inanimate life
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 56.539 58.695 whether I knew this the first afternoon 
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 59.275 65.102 whether I knew the first aft  that first afternoon she would soon inspire me to great imaginary acts of life was unimportant
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 65.56 72.768 For in the realm of the possible ideas are unstable and the only comfort is finally you believe that they are true
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 76.316 81.694 Helena's faraway demeanor without is somewhat present even when the plums were under discussion
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 83.457 89.721 The bling she brought to class were complex enough to send the rest of us into an unusually lengthy if filled silence
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 91.059 97.419 She finds these poems usually ten to fifteen lines long looked clustered and smeared in their small Xeroxed typewriter face
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 97.923 101.896 She signed an MPN as though she were a ship H M Bennett
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 102.614 110.589 She had a peculiar vocabulary and sense of poetic narrative and as she read I thought I could hear each word weave and twist into the lines and stanzas
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 111.219 111.755 Quote
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 112.561 118.97 scratched meek spread in sullen ears and windowed thy hands turned merely brittle and to bone
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 119.676 124.224 We glance in the poem Odin's wovens are the very fits that struck me
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 124.545 131.307 The hard sounds of the brutal beaks and bones mixed with the mythological illusion sent my mind into a whir
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 131.858 133.111 When later I looked up
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 133.506 138.371 Odin comma ravens of in my E S Hamilton I found this
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 138.92 143.814 The Norse god Odin unlike Zeus is a strange and a sullen figure always aloof
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 144.329 151.174 On his shoulders perched two ravens Each day they fly through the world to bring back  bringing back the news of men
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 151.602 154.549 One raven is named Thought and the other Memory
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 155.666 163.554 The implications of such discoveries made a little wedge in my psyche a tiny aperture through which uncharted thoughts had a new point of entry
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 164.045 173.948 On this recent threshold sat a memory met up with the barely distinguishable mouths of desire and from then on worked together to perceive this new beauty of created forms
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 174.435 181.789 The possibility that poems could be much more than inner feelings began to unfold in my mind and I saw the poem as a made thing
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 182.073 185.66 saw that and constructed no less than the pattern of intricate tapestry
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 186.263 189.095 As we hold in my vase this snowflake
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 189.864 196.547 I was stunned with disbelief to look down and see out of one frozen drop the most perfect crystalline form
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 197.349 208.659 So my new understanding gave me the clarity I needed to write a poem as Robert Duncan wrote so beautifully but of not mine but of a made place that is mine it is so near to the heart
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 210.547 211.018 
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 211.849 214.612 Think I should skip just to the front No okay
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 215.32 215.895 um
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 216.259 220.841  You can tell I'm from California that like I just had my first snowflake very recently in my life 
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 222.639 228.47 This is from the second chapter it's called um Echo Ooh which is the secret of written intelligence
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 230.711 233.288 In this I'm jumping back into um my past
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 234.29 241.686 I discovered the duplicitous nature of language quite late in my life from in my family correct English was practically an ethical ideal
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 242.372 255.993 My mother in law to brother Robert had a fixed idea about words which were either right or wrong correctly used or unforgivably misused Using a strict principle they created elaborate vocabulary contests to try and catch each other in the middle of an unintentional malapropism
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 256.387 261.71 They spout out obscure words and used cleverly planned conversation topics to showcase these words
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 262.464 265.512 My mother would trap my brother and then he would return the favor
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 265.841 272.0 As I watched from the sidelines the two of them turned a large vocabulary into a finely honed tool of intimidation
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 272.402 281.836 This vocabulary weapon was compounded when my brother Robert obtained a two wrong and said the condensed Oxford English Dictionary through a mail order book club offer
Moxley-Jennifer_Complete-Recording_Segue-Ear-Inn_NYC_4-27-96 A a 282.785 287.55 It came in a blue cardboard casing with a magnifying glass in a long thin drawer at the top

PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A a 160.88 183.352 From one generation to the next going onto one knee with a spoon Furniture fabric depicting the farmworker's struggle going onto one knee with a spoon The people will neither read nor write going onto one knee with a spoon Inheriting seemingly ghostlike qualities going onto one knee with a spoon
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A a 183.857 194.351 Going onto one knee by sedition the troubled boy is a laughingstock a world lit only by fire the destruction of letters by fire
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A a 194.839 206.035  Going onto one knee by sedition picking through ruins was drying their hands out Going onto one knee by sedition to recognize the investment

PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A a 229.03 231.273 That's it thanks 
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A a 231.839 232.324 
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 274.73 279.983 Hello uh That was that was really nice um Just want to thank Steve because I think
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 280.392 284.11 part of the reason we're here is because we met but two years ago in uh
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 284.684 290.166 up in Sonoma at the University where David and I read and we met and we talked
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 290.563 299.207 and then uh Steve Tills asked us back to talk because we were talking about our mutual interest in troubadour poetry and and then um he asked us to give that
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 299.721 301.93 discussion or talk that we did up in Petaluma
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 302.428 304.527  And from that I think came
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 304.991 306.771 this event here and
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 307.152 308.087 thanks to Louie
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 308.544 310.074 for putting this together and
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 310.4 311.549 for doing these talks
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 312.919 314.456   So I'm going to
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 315.08 320.422 read some poems from Artificial Heart and then I'm going to think I'll read a couple of new poems and I'll come back to poems in Artificial Heart
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 327.766 330.598 This is like in seven little pieces but I don't read the numbers
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 331.595 332.731 New Picnic Time
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 334.097 350.002 Out of this close horizon there are animals breathing unlike a child's drawing of a nativity Orbiting circles with brown Xs farther off pedestrians make parallel lines and collapse into distance or becoming one of several skylines in charcoal or finger paint
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 351.41 367.967 At zero hour an Earth unrights itself becomes an indelible number line counting backward to embrace its new horizon indefatigable zero the high lit window a person tethered to a desk this city and its outline its rivers its cemeteries
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 369.464 385.906 Invisible the orchard keeper's mansion is everywhere The heart becomes one last stone of an existing growth in a squatter's earth Thus in persons and in plants also stone and the brilliant element of fire into the helix and throughout the electrics salt
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 387.633 395.438 Beyond this image decomposing desire and as always with a mouth there is earth because it calls fear is redundant
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 395.847 409.884 and that animal sound in late night is only its own speech becoming one becoming air Books outlasting buildings outlast sweat and the broken human form of body labors whose face is the same as another
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 411.467 433.405 Nothing spoke for itself Every action implied a rhetoric so it may recognize itself To teach to celebrate virtue to persuade by example to lead the court to its ideal self through wonder same page same fable trajectory A window The young father dreaming A hand a face a feeling It was a sound he heard
PhillyTalks10_Complete-Reading_03-01-99_UPenn A b 435.125 443.928 The way of earthworms and coffins of dead infants cobwebs and deformity of windows and the children they expose the signs they carry shame
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 0.644 4.069 You expect to be instructed by instructions and um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 4.723 15.846 you don't get very instructed by them you know And they're very French in the sense that you know it's just sort of kind of like French theory You're like reading along and you go What  You know  Can you run that by me again
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 11.111 12.697 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 13.701 14.38 Ha ha
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 14.916 15.525 Ha
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 16.311 16.907 um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 17.64 21.691 and I liked the way the wit  this quote was um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 22.123 28.038 similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry in in math
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 28.562 42.357 i  a a symmetrical equation i it's the same in both directions You go though all of these procedures and it's the same so nothing actually happens and but all this stuff happens And so you start out with the same thing at either end and um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 42.78 48.941 a and I I was interested in that idea So it's a kind of i  it's a kind of stasis and then symmetry is a kind of stasis
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 49.048 49.63 Hm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 49.346 50.668 and um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 51.433 57.915 uh but it's a it's a kind of quivery stasis that isn't really stasis because it just then it sort of collapses and then you have a kind of
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 58.247 68.07 anti stasis So this this quote seemed to do that for me uh in a way that it was interesting and the only thing that I think that you take from it
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 68.42 77.852 is a sense of symmetricality and that persistence in the situation And that relates to my reading of David which is to say you just have to stare into it and persist
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 77.966 78.485 Mhm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 78.229 91.17 uh So I was just interested in evoking that It doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote it seems anti explanatory And yet it seems kind of to have an uh nuance to  er i  you know numinous quality to it I liked
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 84.833 85.484 Yeah
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 93.394 100.5 That was very clear in in so many points to just said that paragraph Yeah I'm taking notes Now that's
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 96.545 101.552 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 100.701 102.37 That's wonderful So
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 103.117 108.899 So uh so things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 109.689 118.425 Well ye  i if asymmetry as you point out symmetry and not symmetry are the same So an asymmetry ass assumes lack of symmetry and so you know
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 114.277 116.133 They make up symmetry yeah
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 119.506 120.143 x
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 119.561 121.791 So how do you ever get to
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 122.323 126.083 change I mean how does one get  how does one
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 127.067 133.107 how does one think that through so tha  how can one articulate that statement so that change is
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 133.804 136.137 so that the fact of change is encompassed
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 136.822 137.757 Think of death
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 137.999 138.505 Yeah
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 138.473 145.968  It's changed I mean there's there's  somebody in in  I was just in buffalo and somebody said  asked me a question and it was uh
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 138.987 139.507 Uhhuh
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 140.033 140.461 Yeah
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 146.582 154.435 uh What's your position on change Do you think change is  good Or are you against  change
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 148.991 152.117 x 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 154.833 156.702 And uh 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 157.246 165.637 and I I said it just  it  you  we don't have a choice and uh it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes and uh
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 166.139 176.334 uh and yo  when when things are bad you w  you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change And when things are good you don't want things to change because things are good and change would be bad
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 171.593 172.174 Mhm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 176.737 189.154 But you always want something else so you want change because you think things are going to get better Things are not going to get better and it's amazing that we think that  they are
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 178.957 179.379 Mhm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 183.826 185.729 My book said the same thing It's like 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 186.839 189.108 that's true um That 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 189.665 192.301 if the newspaper would review them they'd call them bleak
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 192.722 202.071 Well you know if you're not  if you don't think things are bleak you're not really grasping  what's going on 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 193.392 193.912 Yeah
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 202.615 203.196 Yeah
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 204.884 210.098 Well that kind of brings up for me the question of this um one might call this social imaginary
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 210.552 214.414 of um using um a counting
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 211.962 212.488 Hm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 215.595 218.274 system um For example David you
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 218.623 224.527 were using ten lines and uh you know you're inventing this sort of combinatory
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 225.167 234.837 uh twenty poems ten lines each um within various combinations Is there any um  anything that you attached to
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 228.396 229.522 Mhm mhm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 235.295 242.746 of um  some of larger social import to the use of that sort of counting structure other than merely as a
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 243.175 245.022 as a means to an ending to you
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 243.88 247.14 No absolutely It uh it bec  everyone counts the same
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 247.571 248.128 Uhhuh
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 248.568 250.599 Everyone in this culture counts the same
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 250.984 253.739 So  I mean we're agreed on ten then twenty
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 254.247 256.274 and how you get there
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 256.726 257.447 you know
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 258.145 258.775 So
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 259.368 260.989 uh so because  
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 261.923 263.25 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 263.743 267.788 well it's hard to single one book out but certainly this book
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 268.535 270.914 was concerned with epistemology
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 271.342 273.263 and  how
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 274.064 281.223 when the words never mean exactly the same thing for any one of us as uh nonetheless of society is possible
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 281.581 287.128 whereas I was looking for things like  i was thinking of things like teaching children to read teaching children to count
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 287.907 290.323 and how that is there as some kind of
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 291.171 296.995 outside to each one of us although it's inside us you know That's why it's outside there It's inside us here
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 298.408 300.616  And uh I could say more about that but
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 302.024 305.523 seems more useful to keep responses to like a paragraph
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 306.131 321.1 When you said Everyone counts the same in this culture I thought Boy that's way not true because I thought you meant   some of us are more equal than others 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 312.581 314.315 Oh not  no no no
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 314.884 315.318 No
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 315.7 316.783 No but they should
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 317.792 318.55 That's right
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 319.225 327.558 And but you see  yeah but that's als  but that's  the the way you heard that statement is also correct for this book because there  I believe there's quite a bit about
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 328.192 334.802 social inequity in this book although it's not called by the usual terms Just that they uh  because they had they had Lenin
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 335.221 336.298 Now they've gone limp
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 335.564 336.989 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 336.964 338.242 limp after being
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A c 337.646 338.239 Hm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 338.68 339.689 so uh
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 341.389 343.737 so long engorged that they are now limp
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 344.422 345.009 So
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 345.241 345.902 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 346.593 347.382 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 348.069 376.511 One of the things that I find really fascinating about this whole process um is that it allows um me as a reader to watch each of you as a writer tackling a not exactly parallel but it's the closest thing to it project in ess in essentially the same space Reading the other's work and then constructing something to say out of that process And I am intrigued that both of you to one degree or another um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 377.382 389.229 I would say flirt with narrative in um as though it were behind or related to the text You picking the film that I take it has not ever seen um
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 389.927 391.456 even though you know I 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 391.268 398.126 Which is so symmetrical since the filmmaker has also not seen the film that his film was based  on
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 394.383 395.422 Lots that he 
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 396.003 396.54 Mhm
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 396.059 396.682 Right
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A d 397.214 420.499 And and I and I think David does that as well suggesting a a narrative he never spells out with puns and merit and symmetries and and and n  and actually never bringing it to the surface but then he'll be back to it on on multiple occasions which actually seems closer to the relationship to your text actually and its its relationship and I'm very intrigued in the kind of parallelism
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A b 405.728 406.333  Uhhuh
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 0.594 1.565 To me it was
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 2.03 5.356 particularly telling and why I find it a compelling argument
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 5.64 6.435 because it does
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 6.78 7.717 challenge
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 7.84 10.214 in some ways and initiate a bit of a rupture
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 10.687 11.822 with a l
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 11.9 14.803  uh a poetics of desire and a libidinal economy
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 15.057 16.112 but it also
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 16.65 17.058 x
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 17.29 19.537 initiates this act of pointing
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 20.06 22.06 um which I see a lot
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 22.25 25.13 of in work of my contemporaries
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 25.348 31.072 who are spread out not located um geographically in any particular area
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 31.34 35.26 um that their work p points to particular social facts
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 35.43 37.322 usually that are disgusting
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 37.75 44.396 or not so much that the facts are disgusting but the people are disgusted by the facts they're disgusted by their economic situation
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 44.602 46.013 They're disgusted by
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 46.27 47.501 in Canada how
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 47.847 52.54 following the fifth term of Reagan administration America Canada has to
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 52.815 54.655 mock the same thing and
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 54.96 56.183 and how um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 56.65 58.07 arts funding is being
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 58.24 60.46 stripped away and essentially
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 60.914 63.609 uh a gospel of facts from the right
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 63.8 65.222 has been initiated that
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 65.647 66.541 x debt
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 66.769 67.22 and
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 67.27 70.04 a national debt cannot be challenged in any way that
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 70.719 74.43 that so the gospel x we can't spend because there's a debt
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 74.69 77.773 We have to somehow get rid of this debt before there can be
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 78.08 79.391 any social uh
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 79.85 81.935 any social services left again
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 82.03 83.993 So I was interested in it for its
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 84.05 85.28 ability to
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 85.61 88.995 make some sort of challenge and rupture and also because
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 89.26 92.74 it um articulates this movement towards
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 93.085 94.316 pointing at
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 94.46 95.8 and registering
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 96.01 99.35 disgust and anger with these social facts
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 99.75 100.995 Having said that
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 101.179 102.357 I think that
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 102.83 103.906 it's also
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 104.22 106.545 an contingent poetics I don't think
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 106.71 113.352 a poetics of disgust if it gets taken seriously if it gets picked up by and discussed by anyone and I
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 113.58 115.0 hope it does because
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 115.55 120.312 having spent the time editing the issue I think there's a  it's a really interesting collection of people
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 120.48 122.534 I think it's a contingent poetics
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 122.86 124.837 Which is something that I see emerging
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 125.01 126.802 cross many different communities
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 126.93 128.34 where the kind of larger
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 128.44 131.139 plans that lead to larger works
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 131.212 132.016 are being
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 132.18 134.42 shunted aside in order to have
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 134.53 136.606 a contingent poetics that's
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 136.76 138.914 based on a more momentary
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 138.981 140.794 set of social relations
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 141.01 146.22 and then we could again invoke the homology of social relations in the text there
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 146.34 148.138 or if social relations have sped up
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 148.328 149.842 then one's poetics
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 149.9 151.66 aren't going to be locked in
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 151.77 153.765 How are you going to address a rapidly
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 153.912 157.771 transforming social sphere with a static poetics
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 158.191 160.6 So I see this as a move from
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 161.28 162.864 desire to disgust
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 162.941 164.172 but also from
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 164.86 166.723 um a more stable
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 166.87 168.475 long term plan
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 168.649 174.351 which um Michel de Certeau would register as a strategy towards a shorter term
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 174.42 177.236 tactic of the um contingent
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 181.86 182.845 
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 183.484 192.422 I feel there's a bit of a presidential debate sort of here Quite quite interest I'm just waiting for the x commemorative coins x very very nice
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 192.487 195.646 It'll look so great painted on plates um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 194.572 195.151 Yeah
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 197.15 198.84 I mean it it it sounds
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 199.86 202.452 x this is going to be crude because I haven't read the issue
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 202.973 204.268 and uh
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 204.778 208.09 of the people you mentioned in that issue I think I I know
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 208.23 211.375 some of the work of all but uh one of them but
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 212.244 213.25 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 214.15 218.0 had never thought of them in terms of a of a collectivity
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 218.373 219.225 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 219.431 221.86 and uh which I think actually one of the constant
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 222.11 223.87 sort of underwriting issues
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 224.38 226.113 um that goes on
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 226.79 231.05 for poets of my generation looking at poets of your generation
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A a 231.064 231.606 Mhm
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 231.747 235.17 Steve Evans today um in his poetics uh
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 235.69 237.864 uh email discussion once told me to
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 238.21 239.571 change my song
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 239.7 245.792 uh about this um and uh I responded that I will when it's warranted
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 246.228 247.357 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 249.12 251.498 It it sounds to me from the description
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 252.04 253.93 as though um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 254.14 255.756 having reinvented
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 256.42 259.331 a Brechtian poetics um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 260.649 264.604 there would then be a positing and I'm not sure exactly where
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 265.049 266.227 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 266.47 273.64 sort of the um  the uh inverse x you know and identified our toe and I don't know who that gets to be whether that gets to be
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 273.99 277.671 people of my generation generally or a specific phenomenon
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 277.914 278.889 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 279.284 280.376 Within that
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 280.587 281.658 and
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 283.5 289.926 it feels to me  it it feels to me in that sense um invariably problematic because  of course I I
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 290.14 293.206 I'm one of these people who tends to think that you know
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 293.35 297.736 you want Brecht and Artaud sort of constantly talking to one another
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 297.984 298.9 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 299.23 300.59 At the same time
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 300.886 301.573 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 301.791 302.755 while listening
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 303.062 304.074 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 304.54 306.793 and it it seems in that sense to me um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 308.004 308.984 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 309.245 310.177 problematic
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 310.24 313.69 It also seems problematic to actually think of the tactical
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 314.04 319.2 um as an advance and and and and some of what you say in your piece
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 319.318 321.126 especially towards the beginning of the
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 321.64 324.176  of that one letter um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 324.847 325.928 um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 326.19 327.638 about um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 329.24 330.909 historical inhibition
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 331.16 332.65 It answers a question I think that
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 333.267 338.526 goes on in society in a variety of different fashions x it shows up again x
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 335.591 336.186 Mhm
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 338.928 340.504 the the five um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 341.05 343.088  the five terms of Ronald Reagan
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 343.36 344.56 um 
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 345.78 347.7 in the um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 347.84 350.744 sense that x the fall of Eastern Europe
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 350.918 352.042 is is like this
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 352.35 354.532 very odd phenomena uh
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 354.82 358.385 No leftist I knew in the United States with the exception of about
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 359.39 362.107 ten real sort of retro nostalgic
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 362.164 363.106 x
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 363.55 367.08 um ever imagined that um 
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 368.044 369.46 the Soviet Union
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 369.72 373.67 the good old Soviet Union was anything other than this massive deformation
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 374.07 378.527 of uh socialist discourse which also had the funds
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 378.67 381.19 to subsidize um
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn A b 381.29 384.591 enough people in any given country to screw up their
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 0.147 7.364 All the texts in the book somehow took place in a space that he defined as the Middle East
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 7.766 11.571 and in fact many of them really didn't or don't
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 11.913 15.621 in a in a mental space or even in a physical space
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 16.08 20.551 and part of what I was up to there was to
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 24.63 25.694 include
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 25.988 32.693 the sense of those spaces in wherever I was um And this is something that I've found to be
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 33.554 34.551 extremely
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 35.005 36.314 difficult to do
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 36.736 42.828 under again American circumstances I find very few writers who are able to do this and I
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 43.782 44.198 got
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 44.776 50.88 permission or instruction you know permission in the sense of of Duncan's permission to to
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 51.357 57.917 enter a meadow through the work of of uh  through the wonderful work of Etel Adnan the Lebanese uh writer
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 58.296 69.607 who as she says u uh now wr writes in English and paints in Arabic  u um because essentially she grew up without a language
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 64.158 65.345 
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 70.024 82.423 or with many languages um These are things that can be seen as advantages or disadvantages depending on how you look at it Growing up in a colonial atmosphere with displaced parents who
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 82.993 89.874 had several languages which were not the dominant languages et cetera et cetera She ended up writing in English and somehow
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 90.341 94.429 placed herself in American English but brought in
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 94.78 98.832 all of this experience and to me that was something that was very instructive
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 99.302 101.718 um and something that that
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 102.18 105.36 allowed me to try to think about ways in which
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 106.308 107.862 places could
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 110.747 112.521 be themselves and
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 113.031 118.66 not at the same time because I think there's a privilege given to place which I have tried to
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 119.041 123.695 somehow contest at the same time as I invite it and embrace it
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 124.252 125.102 um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 126.757 136.486 So where I am exactly in all of that is is extremely difficult I mean I  there have been n number of years in which I've simply worked in translation because
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 136.839 137.953 I didn't know where I was
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 138.532 141.077 in terms of where I would begin my language
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 145.527 145.968 That's it
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 146.795 148.036 Yeah I don't see  that
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 148.366 149.314 that's that's good
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 149.951 150.935 I mean its a good answer
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 152.605 153.143 um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 156.012 158.186 How about if we read a little bit
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 158.73 159.348 and then
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 160.168 161.275 open it up to
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 161.697 162.449 discussion
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 163.36 164.027 would that work
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 164.532 164.972 Yeah
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 165.259 166.825 Can I ask a question first
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 167.088 168.098 You certainly may
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 168.678 169.229 um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 170.215 172.099 So I just scream it at her
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 171.72 173.255 No just  I'll repeat it Speak it
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 172.484 177.882 uh Okay um I'm actually  this is such a simple question I'm just wondering what you heard
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 178.659 180.536 that made you say that's my voice
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 181.383 184.961 Oh well I didn't  I don't  uh a are you asking that of me or of him
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 184.614 190.97 I'm asking you yeah uh Answer to the  a question about the answer that you gave before that uh
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 185.704 186.249 Oh okay
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 186.365 186.848 Yeah
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 190.628 191.117 Yeah
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A c 191.294 192.585 the name too it's
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 192.56 193.973 y Yeah um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 194.683 204.827 Right well v voice is a word that is so burdened with theoretical quasi theoretical poetic qu quasi p poetic overtones that 
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 205.386 221.566 I I did use  there was a specific word I used when I described this before but I think I want to back up and and try and say that a little differently because uh it c  the idea of voice can very easily be confused with the idea of a person or poet having a voice which is a w is a way to eliminate
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 221.96 225.651 talking about that person's w work and style and method and
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 226.333 236.575 hm the results thereof and so forth rather  um pretty much or at least in my view or for me people that So uh what the wq  so in a way the question is What did I hear and was it a sound
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 237.305 239.85 y you know because the first thing it was was a sound
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 240.315 241.305 it was a sound
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 241.905 244.382 of a thought of a way of thinking okay So
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 245.466 252.022 the phrase that I used that you heard me read at the end of um Absence Sensorium
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 252.86 257.32 We will crush the arrogant kingdom in our days that's right from the liturgy
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 258.262 260.076 uh that essentially is
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 260.693 261.317 um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 262.079 267.807 and there are actually  many other in what  in that that that are a way of my trying to bring forward
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 268.301 274.101 a liturgy Now the liturgy would  I'm going to take two minutes on this The liturgy is is
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 274.578 277.397 actually a r  a a a place where
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 278.009 282.432 it's a  an anthology The liturgy is an anth  the the liturgy that is the standard liturgy of
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 282.751 288.044 of the tradition I grew up in which essentially is conservative Judaism and  uh w which means
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 288.564 291.114 Orthodox Jewish liturgy translation okay
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 291.477 291.881 uh
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 292.535 293.061 is
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 293.428 296.645 a residue of the rabbis around the
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 297.134 297.572 uh
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 298.012 306.088 turn of the Common Era round  of the first few centuries That's what it  what  and and then again another layer from the uh
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 306.763 309.94 the saf the Safed Kabbalah especially around
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 310.624 317.653 the s the Sabbath All the liturgy around the Sabbath is from  a lot of it is from the sixteenth century from the town of Safed where a lot of
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 318.012 320.41 Iberian Jews wound up and there was a really sort of
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 320.856 336.366 very intense m uh mystical and Messianic body of thought that finds itself  its way into that So what I was hearing I didn't know that actually at that  I mean the point at which I heard these sounds I did not know what this stuff was I didn't understand I was hearing history
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 336.838 345.69 or people individuals or an anthology So for me what I heard w was a sound that sounded like the way I would think
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 346.241 352.633 And then when I went and started to g  look into it and uh by no means am I a scholar and I don't like to pass myself off as one
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 353.14 354.278 I'm not you know
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 354.71 360.607 um uh thankfully which means  that means I could stop reading it when I  feel like it I know that  yeah uh
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 361.207 365.874  If you know what I mean I don't  have not  I don't have the responsibility to be a scholar So um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 367.853 374.129 but that's what it meant What it meant for me was to act  what it turned out to mean for me was to actually hear
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 374.646 375.423 a group
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 376.093 377.004 a bunch
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 377.837 379.873 a a succession of people
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 380.262 382.747 wh whose individual intellectual work in
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 383.116 388.079 well poetry because all intellectual work in that group of people in that historical group
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 389.69 392.335 was poured into this I mean in other words they weren't they weren't
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 393.119 396.126 doing  science They weren't  you know they weren't actually writing
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 396.86 397.382 uh
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 397.815 400.896 quote unquote secular literary works so that this
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 401.646 402.731 work that they did
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 403.107 408.914 that uh w was colle  is collected in midra  in the Midrashim in the Talmud and so forth is
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 409.628 411.33 all of their 
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 411.697 417.538 all impulses of thought poured into a single vessel which makes it extremely rich at least for me
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A b 418.02 418.488 So
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 418.783 421.503 uh Just to  yeah to a to add to that um
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 421.98 430.416 there's a phrase some of you may be familiar with The uh uh  Nathaniel Mackey's phrase of uh Music is wounded kinship's last resort
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn A a 430.945 436.732 uh which is something that I've come back to again and again and it's I think an amplification of an idea that

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 131.046 143.29 In order to live at the pitch of contemporary life we acquire the ability to forgo the intervals of time that are actually needed to consolidate and make part of ourselves what we have already experienced
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 143.771 149.447 Because of the multiplicity of life's possibilities and demands there is little time for this
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 149.898 159.613 Thus we gradually harden ourselves to accommodate reality and even further forget what it is like to imagine really digesting something

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 206.75 215.193 Is it possible to surface unconscious aspects of the identity making mechanism and thereby experience the nexus of the percept coloring process
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 215.603 226.448 I think this is done and can be done again and again in new ways by reading and writing poetry What makes us what we are is determined by what makes us see what we want to see
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 226.799 235.079 On a social level the gradual assertion of the rights of individuals is determined in part by the value that the society places on the individual
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 235.426 243.084 This value not only determines what a society can do to protect the individual but what contributions individuals can make to society
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 243.5 248.295 If all individuals are equal are all individuals then equally expendable
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 248.656 253.259 On the other hand can an individual shed society and thereby transform it
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 254.75 266.512 The determination of the value of protecting the individual is also fostered by the concept of genius It may be that genius is fostered by a mutation of a society's ills with its strengths
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 266.908 272.786 Genius has a way of affecting society deeply although it is asl  always the product of an individual
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 273.116 281.169 Another aspect of genius is that it is an idea that returns to all individuals of value by demonstrating that individuals can make a difference
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 281.534 295.034 in helping reshape society Just as importantly the age of machines has intimidated human beings to the extent that they demonstrate the immense potential power of not individualizing Equivalence of mass produced parts
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 295.646 310.524 Society is tempted to imitate the powerful machine by making its members conform to their ways to producing so uniformly Of course the individual soon realizes the value in learning what are the aspects of non res  reproducibility which are a value

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 318.987 342.438 I've lived with time so long as a limiting and controlling reality that I'm ruined with thinking of it like this I need new images for time I am tired of being pushed in front of it like a child being urged to take its first step or like a pet being dragged along its staccato steps lurching forward one moment and then seeming to drag on forever Locked in a room waiting for its chance to get out
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 342.842 354.158 I can learn to accept a concept of time that is inexorable leading to one inescapable outcome But I can never accept a mechanical view of time that allows for no individual experience

Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 363.249 375.575 We think of the known as the conquistad conquistador of the unknown Two fast terrai  two  vast terrains each pitched in darkness one advancing on the other and the other in grave retreat
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 376.03 384.709 Probably a more apropos portrayal such as may exist between two people let's say allows for a more dynamic yet webbed relationship than that
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 385.113 397.724 And partly because the two quote sides are exchanging something vital to both like a hot potato that neither completely wants yet neither can completely get rid of either over time the relationship transforms both
Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A a 398.055 408.229 At the boundary point between the two there are leaks clusters of origination that might erupt briefly but frequently at this peripheral zone then melt away

PoemTalk-198_On-three-Larry-Price-poems A a 19.24 22.72 so the idea has somehow become the presenter of the monologue

Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 229.293 231.989 Because it seems as if the players have multiplied

Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 232.545 236.539 That is if every self has alterities of various kinds
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 237.021 241.591 and the ethical goal is reciprocal alteri  reciprocal alterity
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 242.747 246.721 it's  there's been a a um  um to morph

Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 252.965 257.005 And that's what I had noticed in the terms of a r of a relationship with mom
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 255.495 256.168 Hm
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 257.455 264.105 do this uh A lot of things need to be said and I wondered whether if anyone else noticed it they would like to comment on it
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 264.807 270.485 That is the ample problem with simple alterity when um one is fissured into writing praise
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 271.56 281.67 um Just the small mathematical question you know um Subject to other  subject at uh uh alterity within the subject and subject
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A d 275.476 275.964 Right
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 282.333 287.865 other abject and I th and I think that you know with regards to the Levinas in question of
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 288.244 298.075 you know the feminine and and the other uh and that's then becoming confounded with women and the question of whether women that occupy the masculine relation to the feminine 
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 298.549 312.633 then sort of framing what is left out of that as actually  and in between a sort of um uh uh destroyed ground which might be the enemy the Palestinian for Levinas uh it might be uh uh
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 310.041 310.454 Huh
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A b 313.054 337.313 it it might be the unmarked  the unreclaimable body and that  and so for me the ethical question had less to do with um the constituent of misrecognition between our own alterity and others which is an asymmetrical landscape and and we're negotiating But uh the further violence of uh an unmarked terrain which enables even plotting self other Hm Yeah x Mhm Yeah
Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A e 334.935 339.76 So putting the third in is really putting a third's attrition within

Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 57.617 61.494 and looks earnestly into the eyes of a girl that isn't there
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 61.973 64.902 then smiles and looks aside coyly
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 65.522 66.332 No money
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 66.883 69.06 And he turns away in disgust

Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 98.209 103.25 But instead of continuing to read about people I wonder if I can read about a dog
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 104.376 105.118 uh
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 105.563 107.099 This is somewhat longer
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 109.103 114.886 The highway I was walking on went through a marsh There were no houses Nothing but the mar
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 121.198 125.514 No one else was walking on the highway in the blazing sun
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 126.06 128.547 I saw the dog a hundred feet away
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 128.876 130.428 a burly fellow
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 130.851 136.683 half Chow I thought half German Shepherd Shaggy hair plastered with mud
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 137.154 140.062 The dog saw me too and came running towards me
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 140.617 143.578 I walked on afraid the dog would bite
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 143.89 148.974 I could hear the nails of his paws clicking on the pavement but he passed me
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 149.387 150.42 never looked at me
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 150.87 152.83 and ran along as I walked
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 153.238 154.759 ten or twenty feet ahead
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 155.262 157.19 ten or twenty feet behind
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 157.845 160.069 I did not like his looks at all
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 160.588 165.596 The heavy brow the square jaws a shaggy dirty fellow
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 166.395 174.576 The road was as lonely as ever marsh under the blazing sky and the motorcars went speeding past
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 175.427 184.177 I could see the pavement of the street on the other side and the bright blue sea It would be cooler there and I might be rid of the dog
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 185.082 192.424 The dog looked up after a while saw me on the other side and he came towards me straight through the traffic
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 193.135 203.633 I stood stock still waiting for the dog to be hit Sure enough the second or third car struck him and sent him sprawling on his back squealing
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 204.058 206.103 The brakes of the car screeched
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 206.526 210.228 The dog leaped to his feet was knocked down again
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 210.986 213.023 and then came running towards me
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 213.622 215.106 You dope I said
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 215.52 224.051 But I was touched at his devotion Now we went on side by side the dog close to me and I no longer afraid
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 224.547 233.919 Now and then we came to a stairway leading to the beach below other dogs who were running about on the sand and the dog was eager to go down
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 234.709 235.643 But he stopped
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 236.139 240.806 waiting for me at the head of each stairway and as I went on followed
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 241.546 245.425 The street turned at last and we were back on the highway
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 245.88 255.403 Now I was afraid to cross for fear the dog would be hit He stood beside me looking up at me watching my hands and feet ready to spring forward
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 255.993 265.103 At last there was a break in the traffic Only two cars coming I could cross easily go part of the way let the cars pass and then cross over
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 265.534 270.474 But I was afraid the dog would rush on and be hit No I said Oh no
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 270.805 274.117 And we walked along the edge of the highway without crossing
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 275.054 278.683 As the dog ran on beside me sturdy and true
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 279.162 284.6 I thought of his lifted face the deep brown eyes watching mine Yes
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 285.021 291.54 I should like to keep him walking so together We came to some houses These were at the sea
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 291.835 298.699 Cottages refreshment stands even a small merry go round I stopped at a stand
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 299.87 305.922 What should I get my dog to eat I asked the pleasant girl behind the counter She smiled at me
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 306.205 312.209 and leaned over the counter to smile at the dog as he stood beside me wagging his tail
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 312.584 314.61 Hamburger she said Dogs love it
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 314.953 315.663 Alright

Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 324.91 328.434 I walked to the corner of the stand The dog followed
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 328.78 330.416 and I put the meat down
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 331.533 333.114 The dog looked at it
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 333.565 340.388 his tail drooped his eyes were glazed with fear and he was off as fast as he could go
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 340.815 342.818 bolting over the sand hills
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 346.074 347.311 That's about it

Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 424.794 431.322 Eighty or ninety men were in the cabin as the launch pulled away There were no lights in the cabin and no room to turn

Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 453.685 457.556 and slowly gained back to an even keel
Reznikoff_Charles_Complete-Recording_St-Marks-Poetry-Project_NYC_1972 A a 458.733 465.78 The men began to feel water running against their feet as if from a hose Cap shouted one the boat is taking water

Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 273.526 274.476 
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 277.931 282.74  Yes and it is just about that way with the ocean
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 283.158 283.828 too
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 285.277 290.887 The song rippling along and the sea in stitches nipping and tucking
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 291.957 297.294  And the river yes it is that Indian lagoon a broad leaf of blue
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 298.037 300.886 A vine narrowing and straying
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 302.827 309.73 There is that bird place stuffed stuffed with wings necks heads and outcry
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 310.442 314.744 and a thousand settle in for the night's dark needs
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 315.842 322.26 Oh those elbows of birds pouchy gullets slow motion legs
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 322.601 325.243 and necks like a shepherd's crook
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 326.362 331.709 What Egyptian mystery hangs by a feather on this egret here
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 332.708 339.723 And what alchemical right bleeds in the pelican's breast 
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 340.136 344.03 Yes that white ruffle of the horizon line
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 344.501 346.373 and the ginger sand
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 347.131 351.345 The pine poking itself outward in green fringe
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 352.005 354.719  Hibiscus double yolk
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 355.239 369.162 and yoga palms stretched like flying fish  breathing deep the shoreline fills to the clouds The cliff
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 370.128 374.382 and soul drinks in the gale and the song
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 376.036 377.64 Heliotrope
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 378.242 379.838 sun turned
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 380.636 382.415 sun turning
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 383.489 392.043 sun how you do do it here yes in this land of swelling air
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 392.525 396.196 Water fruit and flowers
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 396.725 400.923  This place of fruitful swelling
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 401.592 402.494 Yes
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 402.829 404.561 that's what it means
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 404.943 406.183 Your name
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 406.686 407.947 Florida
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 408.529 411.434 
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 412.296 413.078 Now
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 414.571 416.415 let's dry out a bit
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 417.077 424.271 with a piece called How to Rake Water  Begins with Dry water
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 425.718 429.741 The pool of tines through sand
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 431.281 433.032 rakes water
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 433.439 434.82 into waves
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 437.502 441.693 Dry water pools into dust
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 443.599 445.546 Take the stream of time
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 446.153 448.619 and rake it into hours
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 449.581 452.478 Let the dry flowing future
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 452.815 455.879 slake the Earth's thirst
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 457.828 465.026 Water wings whip the great shapes of flying and rake the buoyant water
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 465.454 466.954 into circles
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 467.631 473.385  I am this water  and this rake
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 474.452 476.408 combing my ocean
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 476.943 478.994 into piles of stone
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 483.142 484.395 Water 
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 485.276 487.766 spread thin turns into rain
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 489.235 492.619 holds within banks the cup of seas
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97 A a 494.227 499.71 runs down the mountain's chin and foams in the green beard of trees
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 2.219 4.07 This is a morality play
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 4.565 6.647 It is preparation for departure
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 7.493 14.181 The he and she cause pain with their confusion though it is unintentional
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 16.147 20.161 On homophonic terrain which or witch
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 21.014 24.828 Something trails along after them slight but not dwindling
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 26.052 29.827 While the water laps at the lips now away and now open
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 30.241 32.938 one a portal and the other a spell
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 37.116 39.614  uh And this is a little bit longer and I
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 40.005 47.325 uh I was c certain that I was writing fiction um but uh I have been told since that it is not fiction
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 49.493 49.844 
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 50.213 52.671 This is as close to fiction as I believe I can come
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 53.938 55.487 It's called Crow and Robin
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 56.503 61.408   Nearby I hear the sound of wood planks clunking against each other
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 61.767 64.456 and through the trees comes the clack of hammers
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 64.841 66.341 sometimes a buzzsaw
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 67.646 70.687 The man laughs and says Have you ever murdered a man
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 71.772 73.783 His coworker makes no reply
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 75.072 80.1 The man begins to sing a song but stops interrupting himself with his own laughter
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 83.097 88.189  At home I sit at the kitchen table and look out through the window at the neighbor's garden
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 89.019 90.28 I think about you
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 91.268 94.779 Rather I imagine that I am you
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 96.303 102.184 What would you make of the ragged peonies and why the neighbor  why hasn't the neighbor cut them back as they die
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 103.749 106.95 From inside your body how do peonies smell
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 108.015 115.813 I am embarrassed by the limits of imagination that is how my desire fails as empathy and settles into voyeurism
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 116.72 118.739 Have you ever deadheaded a peony
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 119.465 125.866 I want to know not how the old felted browning petals feel but how they feel to your fingertips
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 127.359 134.67 I wonder if I'd ask a stranger as you must ultimately be a question arising out of genuine curiosity
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 135.854 142.015 I wonder if I'd dare to trespass into my neighbor's flowerbed and cut down her ugly used up flowers
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 145.942 149.502 Across the street Griffin Griffin is three and a half
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 150.34 153.58 He walks to the edge of the driveway holding a bouncy ball
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 154.472 157.864 He aims carefully and then sets the ball down to roll it
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 159.5 161.224 The ball rolls evenly
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 161.89 167.205 Griffin's one year old sister totters carefully toward her brother on her new walking legs
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 167.964 171.571 The ball connects with her shins bringing her to her knees
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 172.082 174.796 Her face bounces down and then off the ball
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 176.366 180.672 Griffin retrieves the ball and walks back to the edge of the driveway starting again
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 181.907 185.426 Griffin honey calls a babysitter Griffin
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 190.791 191.991 I thought it was funny but
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 195.08 198.55 Outside my window on the second floor two birds squabble
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 199.149 202.86 One is a robin and the other looks to be a crow big and aggressive
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 203.526 206.176 The robin is getting beat up but stands its ground
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 206.765 210.907 A huge gust of wind causes the bough to move from due north to due east
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 211.298 214.267 The birds rotate before my eyes parallel with me
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 215.871 224.735 The wind carries the package of itself on the arguing bird voices until a pedestrian walks by and the crow is startled slides off the bough and goes away
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 226.244 232.254 I wanted the crow to be ashamed to leave the branch ashamed that it had forced itself on another bird's home
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 233.47 242.826 Then I realized that I am the crow and you are the robin and a sense of adoration and admiration spreads through me like a new version of the weather
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 244.175 251.557 The crow comes back again and again and I hear the raised voices of the birds merging with the bigger agitated voice of the wind
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 254.751 259.472 Is it really wrong to look for evidence that will prove what you want to believe anyway
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 260.81 266.764 I often find what I'm looking for on a chain of continuity the leading to or following from
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 267.528 274.841 Here in the sequence of reason proof that things may be connected off kilter without there are realizing the link
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 276.763 280.17 This morning as I was listening to the radio I heard this story
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 281.548 284.812  A semi truck is pulling out of a gas station driveway
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 285.51 292.278 Just as it pulls out onto the street a man in a wheelchair rolls in front of it and gets stuck in the grill of the truck
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 293.197 300.212 The truck driver drives four miles at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour completely unaware of his front loaded passenger
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 301.429 306.951 When the truck finally stops the wheelchair is detached from the truck and its occupant is unharmed
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 307.574 310.431 He describes the experience as Quite a ride
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 312.251 314.222 That was on NPR too I will say
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 316.668 323.105 Could there be more to the crow than its obnoxiousness Doesn't it too have a right to be hungry to need shelter
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 324.295 330.233 I watch it trying to get its glossy head into the bird feeder meant for finches and sparrows Very smart
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 331.089 335.598 If I were the stand in for the crow then could I convince someone to love me
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 336.498 343.905 I imagine watching you watch the crow your good humor but your sense ultimately that this bird is not subtle
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 345.02 348.691 A pest you think it should blow away in a summery gust
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 350.191 356.833 Coming home from work I see my young neighbor Griffin running up the empty sidewalk looking back over his shoulder
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 357.39 359.369 As though I think with amusement
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 359.744 361.46 there was someone following him
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 365.179 372.569 I am raking up the fallen mess of leaves and sticks in the yard when I notice that the woman next door is carrying sticks and branches out to the curb
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 373.174 375.688 We both continue without acknowledging each other
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 376.341 385.271 After a while I see the man across the street sawing off a half broken branch from a tree and then that another neighbor is silently raking up debris from the storm
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 387.333 391.975 Far down the street some day laborers are talking animatedly in Spanish
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 392.295 395.033 Otherwise there are no human voices
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 399.479 402.595 In the middle of the night I wake up to terrified screaming
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 403.369 405.412 One creature preys upon another
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 406.365 412.91 And after the screams quite near the wounded animal takes up a desperate snoring breathing
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 414.145 416.715 I turn on the porch light and the breathing stops
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 417.64 419.915 then starts again more irregular
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 421.464 427.657 I can't see what is out there even though the sound of it is so sharp that it's in my nostrils and on my tongue
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 428.666 430.789 I wish you were here to comfort me
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 431.637 437.408 But I make my fear correct itself I would be you the self at a loss
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08 A a 438.329 442.335 The invisible hand that rests on the shoulder of its own body guiding it
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 0.288 1.79 Forward and to the right
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 3.95 5.421 Zeroing in on
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 6.18 8.871 a rhythm of speech that moves from heart to heart
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 9.37 10.69 Zeroing in on
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 10.95 13.4 and in the moment unable to hold onto it
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 13.56 15.62 The suspension a kind of start
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 16.0 18.575 way classic in its sundry appeal
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 19.13 20.96 that accordion way of life
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 21.3 22.841 People sitting everywhere
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 23.16 25.378 to walk in and see all those people
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 27.328 28.222 not even
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 29.12 34.375 I stumbles and falls becomes an empty underscore italicizing nothing
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 35.41 39.09 Hundreds of thousands of email messages gone forever
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 39.26 41.972 Deeply buried in unwound time
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 42.672 43.545 Flickering
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 43.642 44.814 I'll get right on it
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 44.989 45.851 Get it right
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 45.955 46.604 and
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 46.74 48.4 that's not what I heard
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 50.82 52.23 Reading by hand

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 283.24 286.152 it's been coming out  we've been working on it since I think about
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 286.35 288.582 two thousand I mean it's been almost ten years now
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 288.9 291.71 and through correspondence on the internet
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 292.144 293.097 and um
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 294.04 296.48 uh I guess about three years ago

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 297.755 298.334 uh
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 298.53 304.153 completing it and getting it out and it's it's been published in a series of small books I didn't bring a copy
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 304.53 307.77 um but um they're quite beautifully designed they're
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 308.582 309.072 kind of
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 309.164 311.207 nice pocket size and each one
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 311.61 313.109 has um

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 331.626 333.07 I found that in doing it
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 333.3 335.196 it's th  I sort of have to
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 335.38 337.178 reinvent how I do it every time
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 337.677 343.392 So I'm going to read the the latest one and this one I guess is just out I haven't seen it yet but it's it's uh part nine

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 355.567 356.344 thinking about

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 358.521 361.915 the story takes place which is kind of back in the day and then
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09 A a 362.09 367.35 the time in which the writing has taken place which really has has covered you know almost a ten year period

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 17.048 24.047 The letters are secure in their variously circumscribing words The words represent a kind of packaged application of signification
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 24.447 30.481 Letters are elements in a toolkit for spelling words Think about it Train whistle leaves us speechless
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 31.955 42.269 Imagine letters Imagine letters breaking the boundaries of words Imagine words breaking open their envelopes never to be the same broadly speaking into an eventually undifferentiated state

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 48.973 79.356 All words are lures all dreams means Some meanings lost others mostly draws the slim files of random data fragged and tossed The lessons scattered at bus stops Forgotten angles on past lives Situations not right Solo entries onto barren planes suggesting mighty stories savored late at night Collapsing in piles on hotel room floors circulating high above commercial districts Emptying out into freeway sounds at night Standing for thoughts never uttered eyes shut tight against material operations going on as if on their own
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 81.266 82.192 Next to nothing

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 104.02 108.122 Cascading granularity moves us forward and to the right
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 108.964 110.493  Zeroing in on 
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 111.107 126.223 a rhythm of speech that moves from heart to heart zeroing in on and in the moment unable to hold onto it the suspension a kind of start way classic in its sundry appeal That accordion way of life people sitting everywhere to walk in and see all those people
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 127.299 128.448  not even
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09 A a 129.536 134.245 Eye stumbles and falls becomes an empty underscore italicizing nothing

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 0.168 29.496 The desert brush is burning the cocoon of hammock or sack which is the hennaed man who's carried by the boys They're carrying the wrapped cocoon on poles the earth before them is cracked But above it it is lined covered by the heavy sky They trot on its sticks It isn't being dead The only Paradise is not being dead The hennaed man is but the boys aren't From above the lines and ridges of the brown desert when one is flying only when one is flying
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 29.886 41.965 It is a waste area Amid one's heart as which an organ pumping blood it is illuminated A barren desert with tracks on it a track leading to a vast lake which is a pale blue from above
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 42.293 60.254 If this occurs it goes into it at the moment it is seen I saw it when flying There's a haze of billows of smoke and ridges Man who's risen by sycophancy is remembered for no reason as defenses Yet one is continuing and seeing whatever occurs still
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 60.728 90.72 Cocooned sack in which the hennaed man is swathed and carried by the boys is occurring their walking sticks on the cracks is manual On a hot day rode in the cab across the city and the cab driver played hymns on the radio while singing a different hymn at the same time in a cracked voice If he wasn't singing counter to a hymn he'd murmur about how we have to believe to it I had the thought He can't be without this in the city driving because it's occurring Occurring is in silence this hasn't happened before

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 98.0 182.444 These men who are cousins are construction workers who were nomads for the joy of it To have a job so as to leave It comes from this This is a way of life in which there are no marriages or connections though there are children Catching up to the hennaed man whose head is hanging out of the sack Flippering head to head on the desert it's hanging from the cocoon swaying on poles on which the stick starving boys are struggling There is no minute movement Laying them out on a mat dabbed to clean them though the hennaed man is the one dead who'd been alive for only an instant and they who aren't wrapped him and are moving with him toward the billows of fire on the plain That or spirals They are not moving to one of these The swans flap up honking or hooping as they're coming shimmering in a V on itself so they're simply the thin topaz air The desert is crisscrossed with a few roads from above The man loving celebrities and the wife are in a car that has broken down on one out there They get out and are standing beside it which is pushed out and is burning in front of them and there's nothing inside them The muscular movement is coming from some black robes blowing with no eyeholes That or outside them the man and the wife who's weeping with the burning car outside them He's quiet isn't jeering from inside movement from in him standing The desert is outside them and the moon is It's out in front of them so that it's in it Bright moon is in front of them
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 182.766 195.108 In the deserts that's on fire the black robes blow out on it not in the line of the spirals They're going at a trajectory with no movement in them I want so much to be w where I was before I was me
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 195.448 209.348 trying to be in the night as day pushed out and so it is in the day when it is night The moon is in front It is on the plane The moon is in front of me so that there is nothing in me Yet on the rim the girl spits on me for a flicker
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 209.71 221.315 The girl spitting on me her being so immature that the friends stare at me creating a conformity to which if I object I'm merely self serving It is invalidated by having occurred in me
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 221.668 267.37 To be what I am before I am me It is pushed out in the moon in front which is before rather than me Looking at the dog lying in the gutter whose thin layer of sheath of fat is seen on the ribcage which is open The friends create this conformity with is limpid occurring before They don't have faces staring Why did one see them before They'd say it is self serving to see this and so anticipating Breathing in and out The breath is in the moon that is out side in front It isn't in me so it doesn't matter if one is walking It is in the trees that are in the blue sky Birds go by So the day is in the night at once I felt joyful these events happened slowly before me
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 267.949 272.398 He's holding the tips of the ribcage like fins and the member put in the end

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 278.424 295.638 Seeing on the street the blue burnished face banged up walking I followed him who'd been on the garbage He continues walking ahead Being outside is simple It's pushed out there The tool is completely distorting and having a feeling highlights that putting a lining under it
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 296.056 304.207 Walking in is in it This lovely moon that was out there in the day orb in front of me The hennaed man alive for only an instant
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 305.479 323.898 had never been alive and so the breath is outside without the moon This stick starving boy's trotting on the desert carrying the cocoon as seen in reverse I couldn't sleep and yet couldn't sit up either I have to see the night but with my eyes closed from being tired and therefore immature
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91 A a 324.282 345.344 Communal is completely simple being outside only with the moon in front of me walking with no one there is not doing anything What one sees inside It is moving backwards or turned around the hennaed man alive for only an instant who's never been alive is it And not being myself riding up the street a while ago people coming out or standing
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 0.16 2.474 To a moment or like a moment

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 4.621 9.106 w wanting to like continue it just a little long longer as a unifying
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 9.877 11.09 time capsule
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 13.45 16.155 A kind of pressing  that kind of pressing that
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 16.486 19.798 that Bob was describing as the pressure of O'Hara
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 21.521 26.022 Like he wants to have a moment which is kind of vague when you read it like on the page
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 27.037 27.683 Yeah
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 27.663 29.41 But yet as you said before
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 31.176 32.397 in relation to the poems it
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 32.764 34.692 like it occurs quickly as a procession
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 35.179 36.4 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 35.362 36.623 but as recorded
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 37.226 40.147 it seems to somehow want to just
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 40.459 43.994 push the limits of what would otherwise be considered a moment
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 44.483 47.614 And you also use the expression resonance and duration
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 48.061 49.785 I think that that is sort of a
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 50.736 51.367 kind of a 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 52.045 52.915 oh boy
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 53.893 54.516 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 54.46 56.074 a characterization of this moment
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 56.928 61.246 Right well it's the conflict between the fact that you can apprehend
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 61.852 65.802 an huge amount but you c  but in order to write that to say it
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 66.296 67.509 i is um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 68.473 73.821 it c  in the um  a and the fact that you're x  u uh if you're unable to write that uh
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 75.111 81.265 would be it's impossible and also that your perception or your being in the moment the moment doesn't exist anyway
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 82.094 84.074 um So it's attempting to
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 84.487 85.7 to realize that
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 86.099 89.491 In other words that you've completely fabricated this and your sense of the moment
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 90.768 93.123 uh it has never existed and it isn't there
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 94.551 102.606 um So I relate that to that previous question of whether something's being nullified In a sense there is that that uh it has to be your understanding
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 102.995 107.616 that you can only exist in the present but you're never in it and that it
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 107.927 108.446 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 108.419 110.279 and that you can't um 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 111.221 113.48 and that it doesn't exist  anyway
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 113.621 117.013 So you don't want to be limited by the boundaries of a coherence
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 114.122 114.641  So 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 117.384 119.132 that itself is 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 119.97 121.566 I would say doesn't exist
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 120.912 134.748 Right well it's kind of as if if you had the moment as a frame so to speak if that made any sense that you would the the the writing will go past  it will kind of go past that boundary and it will show you that it's past that boundary by being so big
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 135.28 137.514 or um through something like that
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 138.296 141.881 but it demonstrates that tension of being inside or outside of something
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 143.302 143.861 It's
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 144.373 156.438 Is it also illusory because it's an example of uh like what you've been talking about fabricating um a sense of the moment or a construct of the moment out of the past out of what you remember
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 156.785 171.379 Is that is that relevant is that relevant to your  I mean once you get past the moment you're still writing that moment has passed You're in a sense remembering something or what it was like when that moment was taking place which still is is  you know it's not possible
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 172.941 180.788  uh Yes u uh right but you would always be  it's simp  it is simply that that you would always be behind time even if you're sitting right here
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 174.156 174.635 Time
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 181.406 181.997 um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 182.615 184.657 There's no such thing because you're  not
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 187.258 191.259 if you're in s  in the second y  it's already behind you
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 192.014 192.485 I'm
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 193.11 197.045 I'm interested in this this whole idea of um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 198.593 202.316 constructing um o of of um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 203.105 209.297 constructing some kind o of oh um uh linguistic surface or a poem out of
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 209.625 222.062 the past out of what's  you know out of what's remembered in a sense The images like you know here are not nullified because they're still they're still something left over and and that is
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 222.321 226.827 just a sense of of what's been constructed out of what what he remembers
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 227.258 232.369 I'm struggling with it a lot because I'm having a really hard time trying to um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 233.009 236.449 articulate what I'm thinking about and I have been thinking about this a lot
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 236.773 242.806 um in terms of my work w uh  in the poetry of John Ashbery which I think has a lot which 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 243.597 261.908 the discussion today of O'Hara's poem has a lot of of resonance with  I see him as also constructing this this kind  th this you know this this linguistic web and and his you know wr  u uh and working in like just extended long sentences and that kind of thing especially in things like a s  um um The System
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 262.858 263.345 But
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 263.84 266.067 it's  there's still a sense of
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 266.715 267.569 u um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 268.176 283.711 even though the surface  you know even though you know it's h it's highly rotten rhetorical and superficial there's still somehow something being remembered into the  you know into the present of experiencing that text and and I was wondering if you kind of thought about 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 284.125 285.322 the I mean uh  
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 286.092 298.318 anyway I mean this is what um um you know that what I was thinking of anyway is is like the work of of Ashbery especially like in his longer more you know more meditative kind of works I think it works with with that O'Hara
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 298.861 300.549  uh
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 301.742 303.97 Yes  uh Let me see I don't know

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 338.303 340.498 crossed paths in terms of
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 341.383 348.84 sense of immediacy or something I haven't been  to be fair I missed it I didn't quite uh say much we'd be talking about how Duncan's not speaking for something

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 371.006 381.254 he would use the vocabulary of saying that is uh i in the heightened sense because actual  experience is that But in other words it's not something that is removed from one that is um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 381.964 393.417 in the nature of say of uh religion which is a doctrine which you learn in which you are distanced from God or um uh  you are that and you have to realize that huh
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 392.686 396.645 So you're s so you're saying it's it's not  like the platonic reading is not
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 397.319 405.164 reading a bit more than junk meaning uh uh the experience as something that  as a reflection of something out there rather than the important thing itself

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 417.703 418.956 in terms of
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 419.339 425.468 damned enemies in poetry and being very different I was interested in this point of intersection we were talking about

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 428.299 432.939  the uh   I've done readings of Duncan in terms of
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 433.441 434.926 sort of platonic
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 435.778 437.015 way of the part in
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 437.436 440.916 experience or the material of what's actually going on
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 441.834 442.743 is
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 444.154 445.048 not
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 445.841 451.089 as you said not as important as what what it suggests Sometimes in the realm
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 452.294 456.299 and that soul is sort of not really world and I'm  so I was interested in 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A b 456.945 459.818 what if anything the idea of human ex  we're talking experience
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 460.549 466.539 Well that  it's confusing because one doesn't know what transcendent realm or whatever I've

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 466.95 477.159 because what I think he's trying to do in the HD book is to say  to bring it back to something that  where the one self or all objects or all beings are
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 474.54 475.593

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 488.889 491.227 But then  that's 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 492.146 492.784 um 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 493.521 497.34 so that's what's being read that's what's being seen it's the um

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 500.578 504.672 and that's what he means by words like magic or writhe um
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 505.192 509.81 It's apprehending that aspect of something in the actual being uh
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 506.019 506.753 
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A c 510.382 514.858 rather than removing it from one's self as a um   er

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 202.374 207.238 So I uh I wanted to talk about the blog a little bit more before it gets too far away from that
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 207.629 208.433 um
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 208.713 217.425 And I was really curious  I mean you talked a lot abo  you talked a little bit about how it's a way to educate people without the filter of the university
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 217.288 217.995 Grotesque
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 218.048 220.492 G grotesque filter of the university
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 219.052 221.774 You like that word 
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A b 220.276 222.623  You said it
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 222.439 228.689  um And I I remember a couple of years ago when you disabled comments on your blog
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 228.534 229.215 Yes
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 229.091 230.931 and the reasoning you gave was
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 231.11 235.829 trolling and flaming and I know the Buffalo poetics listserv kind of had the same thing a few years ago
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 236.0 237.687 and um I mean it's
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 237.85 242.753  the the first thing I thought of was a sort of generational thing because I think for the young people in here like
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 242.88 248.053 we see YouTube comments or these kinds of things that you know you know you know what to ignore and you know what to listen to
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 248.25 252.02 um So I was curious if you think there is any sort of like general
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 252.28 254.33 uh  generational divide in
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 254.58 259.25 you know language we accept if there's a valuation of language in the discussion
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 259.42 261.49 um that kind of goes on on the internet
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A c 261.791 262.692 um If x
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 262.421 270.614 Well x actually it's more gender than a than a generational one at least with regards to the blog but I  I'll try and deal with both of these
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 270.928 271.785 um

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 284.43 287.53 uh was beginning to extend further and further
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 287.818 294.483 um There were a number of people  are a number of people not just on my blog but elsewhere on the net
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 294.785 295.647 um
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 295.71 300.57 who do seem to be completely unaware of the implications
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 300.714 305.228 of some of their language when they use terms of color and gender
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 305.36 312.323 when you know it's the x  you know there's the joke of the old Saturday Night Live routine Jane you ignorant slut

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 319.53 324.2 and uh not catching every one of those every day 
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12 A a 324.34 326.07 meant that I was

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 120.481 126.85 The weaker this orientation and calculation are the less organized as regards paragraphs our speech will be

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 154.029 161.962 In such a case a shift occurs in the speaker's attention from the referent of his speech to the speech itself reflection over one's own words

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 250.76 257.558 Logically these lead to a third sentence or conclusion a higher level of meaning Some lawyers were once girls

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 312.418 326.791 And uh the assumption is that s  This is why we talk language is again the sort of thing that you can only integrate with the previous sentence by making that what I am going to continue calling a syllogistic leap or a syllogistic movement above the level of the sentence

Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 284.355 285.92 Mostly they complain
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 286.9 289.77 Boober bangs the lid for them to calm down
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 291.544 292.764 It doesn't work
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 294.06 301.129 At the last annual convening of the International Monetary Fund Boober spoke to a packed house about toad stuff

Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 309.971 312.29 Sometimes Boober and me smoke pot
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 315.0 319.512 Other times usually while banging Boober has a twi twitch of sympathy
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 319.71 325.487 but always for himself and he calls the phone and it and it says anything so he bangs on it too
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 325.754 332.291 and I feel sorry for it and hang around with all these other things in the room wondering about this banging toad in my life
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98 A a 334.21 340.326 Boober gets a by gosh by golly expression which on a toad looks like all their other expressions

Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 9.473 11.572  Well let me read the fourth okay
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 13.401 15.143 Brief Moments with Tchaikovsky
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 17.016 17.523 
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 17.906 19.34 You are in for a rare treat
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 19.95 22.522 Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky is in a playful mood
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 23.561 34.841 Over here he declares pointing to the croissant sitting atop what appears to be a raisin Is the extraordinary Pere Lachaise Cemetery with the magnificent Marc Antoine Charpentier far beneath its crust
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 35.421 38.734 You will have to imagine the sounds of the Baroque concertino yourself
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 39.307 43.902 If you want to know I think in my best moments I am worthy to nourish the same patch of ground
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 44.615 48.017 or vice versa he adds with a wink biting off an end of the croissant
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 48.332 51.838 and leaving Carpentier exposed to the close air of the parlor
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 53.072 57.799 Any particular Baroque composer I enquire whose concertina I'm supposed to be imagining
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 58.676 63.176 I didn't say the composer had to be Baroque Peter counters airily Only the work
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 63.717 64.883 What about Porcini
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 65.791 67.55 I had to confess I was stumped
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 67.92 73.912 The only composer I knew by that name was a local and rather inept butcher who somewhat resembled the results of his trade
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 75.407 82.939 My host who by this time had finished off both the Pere Lachaise Cemetery and the remains of poor Charpentier was looking particularly sly
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 83.834 88.71 What instruments are used in this concertino by Porcini that you have in mind I ask carefully
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 89.307 95.637 But I could see that I had waited too long that Tchaikovsky had entered the tunnel of self absorption and was already far out of earshot
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 97.094 100.674 I will enter the salon of the immortal soul he continued to himself
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 100.995 104.22 flinging open the closet with an elegantly melancholy flourish
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 105.166 108.549 Staring at the not overly expansive view he mumbled aloud
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 108.995 117.954 I would never have tried to support myself by playing the piano by simultaneously reading a book in a Hamburg bordello like my cunningly controversial colleague once did
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 118.374 120.164 It was Brahms if you want to know
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 120.884 124.574 And I know what women are like too They're different and I don't understand them
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 125.386 127.808 He pointed indecisively at the further wall
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 128.144 133.782 See that promontory over there A beautiful siren used to sit and comb her tasteless mass of tresses
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 134.348 137.79 Once I approached and the smell was absolutely horrible
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 138.304 140.917 But alas I will never see her splendid face again
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 142.393 142.756 
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 147.041 147.932 
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 155.91 157.741 And these are earlier obviously
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 159.598 161.782 Not in geological time particularly but
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 164.378 165.359 historical time
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 166.991 169.059 And The Allegorical Figure of Brooklyn
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 170.802 176.652 And the allegorical figure of Brooklyn is right here there where you're standing and here's how it works
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 177.304 179.908 The lamps go on and we walk through miles of parts
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 180.375 184.997 The rain and the sleet are brought on We travel to Queens for two weeks of vacation
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 185.403 190.574 The sun returns and the grass and farms the villages of Brooklyn continue to grow
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 191.053 194.215 And the spacious terrace and oily sand of Brooklyn breathe
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 194.647 201.452 rocked slowly by the figure and back toward home on the BMT we smile at the tender figure and wave goodbye
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 212.499 213.178 North
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 214.756 216.207 The direction not the poet

Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 227.834 231.29 Nineteen sixteen seven with its fatal look of artificial brevity
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 231.841 234.579 your life as if an illusion putting you near the window
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86 A a 234.963 237.782 and promptly all the winds and currents ruffle the curtains
