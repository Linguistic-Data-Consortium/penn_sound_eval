POPEYE CHUCKLED AND SCRATCHED HIS BALLS IT SURE WAS PLEASANT TO SPEND A DAY IN THE COUNTRY THIS NEXT POEM MUST DATE FROM ABOUT NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR WHEN I AT LAST JUST COULD NO LONGER ESCAPE TEACHING AND AND BEGAN TEACHING POETRY TO STUDENTS AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE AND FOUND MYSELF IMMEDIATELY ASSAILED BY THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS POETRY AND WHY IS THIS A POEM AND WHY DO YOU SAY THIS is not AND WHAT IS POETRY ANYWAY AND SO THIS CALLED WHAT IS POETRY BUT THE TITLE HAS NO QUESTION MARK AND I do not THINK IT WAS PROBABLY VERY HELPFUL TO THE STUDENTS BUT IT WAS PART OF MY FINALLY BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS POETRY MYSELF HAVING DONE IT FOR A LONG TIME with out EVER HAVING ASKED MYSELF THAT QUESTION AND IT ENDS AS SO MANY OF MY POEMS DO OR OR RATHER THEY INCLUDE LINES OF B BITS OF CONVERSATION OVERHEARD VERY OFTEN WHEN WALKING DOWN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK WHERE YOU HEAR RATHER PECULIAR THINGS some timeS WHAT IS POETRY THE MEDIEVAL TOWN WITH FRIEZE OF BOY SCOUTS FROM NAGOYA THE SNOW THAT CAME WHEN WE WANTED IT TO SNOW BEAUTIFUL IMAGES TRYING TO AVOID IDEAS AS IN THIS POEM BUT WE GO BACK TO THEM AS TO A WIFE LEAVING THE MISTRESS WE DESIRE NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO BELIEVE IT AS WE BELIEVE IT IN SCHOOL ALL THE THOUGHT GOT COMBED OUT WHAT WAS LEFT WAS LIKE A FIELD SHUT YOUR EYES AND YOU CAN FEEL IT FOR MILES AROUND NOW OPEN THEM ON A THIN VERTICAL PATH IT MIGHT GIVE {us / u. s.} WHAT S SOME FLOWERS SOON {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} THE LAST LINE IT MIGHT GIVE {us / u. s.} WHAT SOME FLOWERS SOON THAT I OVERHEARD A BOY SAYING TO A GIRL IN BRENTANO'S BOOKSHOP IN NEW YORK AND DECIDED TO KEEP IT THE NEXT ONE AT NORTH FARM WAS WRITTEN IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND ALTHOUGH NORTH FARM OBVIOUSLY COULD BE ANYWHERE AND I do not EXPLAIN IN THE POEM WHA WHAT

PRONUNCIATION PLACE DESCRIBED AS BEING NEAR HELL BUT NOT EXACTLY IN IT AND ALWAYS WITH THE EPITHET LOOMING AND PROSPEROUS NORTH FARM AT NORTH FARM SOMEWHERE SOMEONE IS TRAVELING FURIOUSLY TOWARD YOU AT INCREDIBLE SPEED TRAVELING DAY AND NIGHT THROUGH BLIZZARDS AND DESERT HEAT ACROSS TORRENTS THROUGH NARROW PASSES BUT WILL HE KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU recognise YOU WHEN HE SEES YOU GIVE YOU THE THING HE HAS FOR YOU HARDLY ANYTHING GROWS HERE YET THE GRANARIES ARE BURSTING WITH MEAL THE SACKS OF MEAL PILED TO THE RAFTERS THE STREAMS RUN WITH SWEETNESS FATTENING FISH BIRDS DARKEN THE SKY IS IT ENOUGH THAT THE DISH OF MILK IS SET OUT AT NIGHT THAT WE THINK OF HIM some timeS some timeS AND ALWAYS WITH MIXED FEELINGS WELL THIS IS A FAIRLY RECENT POEM OF THE PAST FEW YEARS do not KNOW EXACTLY WHEN CALLED AT FIRST I THOUGHT I would not SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I {can not / cannot} THINK OF ANYTHING I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WROTE IT SO I will not INTRODUCE IT EXCEPT I SEE IT HAS THE PHRASE THE UNRULY SUN OBVIOUSLY A THEFT FROM JOHN DUNNE AT FIRST I THOUGHT I would not SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT THEN I THOUGHT KEEPING QUIET ABOUT IT MIGHT APPEAR EVEN RUDER AT FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD

POEM IS CALLED NO LONGER VERY CLEAR AND WELL {it's / it is / it has} NO LONGER VERY CLEAR TO ME WHEN I WROTE IT OR WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WROTE IT how ever I I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE PUBLIC RADIO STATION IN IN NEW YORK CITY WNYC HAD A BENEFIT CONCERT AND THEY ASKED ME TO CONTRIBUTE A POEM WHICH WOULD BE SET TO MUSIC BY A NUMBER OF CONTEMPORARY COMPOSERS OR AT ANY RATE THEY WOULD WRITE MUSIC SUGGESTED BY IT IF THEY were not ACTUALLY SETTING THE WORDS AND PHILIP GLASS MORTON GOULD TANIA LEON WERE AMONG THE COMPOSERS AND ONE OF THEM WAS THE COMPOSER JOAN TOWER WHO IS ACTUALLY A A FRIEND OF MINE AND AND COLLEAGUE AT BARD COLLEGE WHERE SHE TEACHES AND SHE TOOK TWO OF THE LINES AND WROTE PIANO PIECES THAT SHE SAYS ARE BASED ON AND THEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOING TO DO ANOTHER ONE TO MAKE THREE BUT SHE has not DONE IT YET
