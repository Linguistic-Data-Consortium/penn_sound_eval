Piombino-Nick_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn_NY_4-22-89 A Subject 0.422 408.229 SCIENCE IS KEEPING WORK IS WEEPING TO BE DECOROUS IS NOT TO BE FORMALISTIC THE FIRST MAY SIMPLY BE SHOWING SENSITIVITY TO A FORMAL CONTEXT THE SECOND CREATES A CONTEXT IN EVERY DAY PRACTICE TRUTHS ARE DETECTED BY APPREHENDING CADENCES THESE ARE CONFIRMED BY A KIND OF SUBLIMINAL SOUNDING THAT EMPLOYS ASPECTS OF VISION AND TOUCH CHARM FURTHERS PROPAGATION THEY COULD INTERRUPT OR STOP ANYTHING BUT TRUE CELEBRATION CELEBRATION CEREBRATION COULD THIS HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ACT OF MENTAL FREEDOM PIERCE THE MEMBRANE BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY AND SOMETHING STARTS TO LEAK THEN FLOW HAPPINESS IS ALWAYS CONVENTIONAL IRRITATION SURPLUS STIMULATION WISDOM DOES IT CONSIST OF LITTLE MORE THAN ACCEPTING HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN IF SATISFACTION IS THE MEASURE THIS IS EASY TO SEE PERFECTION IS A KIND OF SURFACE WHOLENESS MUST BE BOUNDED BY A SHELL OR SKIN TO BE A UNIT IS TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE AND AN INSIDE PLACE YOUR BETS THEN LAUGH AND THE GAME COMES TO AN END SO SOON IN CASE YOU MIGHT FORGET EXAGGERATE ADHERING TO THE WORLD BY MEANS OF GLUE IDEAS ARE USEFUL MAINLY WHEN {they are / they were} WET BUT THE DRY REMAINS FASCINATE REALITY IS LIKE A SEA THE WORLD CONTAINS MANY THOUGHTS AND FEW IMAGES o. k. i am GOING TO READ A FEW MORE JOURNAL SELECTIONS AND THEN BRUCE SANJO'S TURN SEVEN ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT IN ORDER TO LIVE AT THE PITCH OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE WE ACQUIRE THE ABILITY TO FORGO THE INTERVALS OF TIME THAT ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO CONSOLIDATE AND MAKE PART OF OURSELVES WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF {life's / life is / life has} POSSIBILITIES AND DEMANDS THERE IS LITTLE TIME FOR THIS THUS WE GRADUALLY HARDEN OURSELVES TO ACCOMMODATE REALITY AND EVEN FURTHER FORGET WHAT IT IS LIKE TO IMAGINE REALLY DIGESTING SOMETHING SEVEN THIRTEEN TIME OUT OF TIME THE MORE I AM HEARD THE MORE I MUST RESORT TO SILENCE TO BE HEARD THE FASTER I GO THE MORE STEALTHILY I MUST MOVE SEVEN FOURTEEN THE IMAGINATION FORTHRIGHTLY ENCOUNTERED CAN NEVER BETRAY AND WILL ALWAYS REVEAL FOR THIS KIND OF ENCOUNTER TO BE OPEN INTERNALLY how ever IS AS DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTLY AS RARE AS IN EXTERNAL ENCOUNTERS SEVEN EIGHTEEN LIFE PRESENTS ITSELF TO {us / u. s.} ALL AT ONCE AT ALL TIMES IN ITS ENTIRETY SEVEN TWENTY ONE IS IT POSSIBLE TO SURFACE UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF THE IDENTITY MAKING MECHANISM AND THEREBY EXPERIENCE THE NEXUS OF THE PERCEPT COLORING PROCESS I THINK THIS IS DONE AND CAN BE DONE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN NEW WAYS BY READING AND WRITING POETRY WHAT MAKES {us / u. s.} WHAT WE ARE IS DETERMINED BY WHAT MAKES {us / u. s.} SEE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE ON A SOCIAL LEVEL THE GRADUAL ASSERTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IS DETERMINED IN PART BY THE VALUE THAT THE SOCIETY PLACES ON THE INDIVIDUAL THIS VALUE NOT ONLY DETERMINES WHAT A SOCIETY CAN DO TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE TO SOCIETY IF ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE EQUAL ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS THEN EQUALLY EXPENDABLE ON THE OTHER HAND CAN AN INDIVIDUAL SHED SOCIETY AND THEREBY TRANSFORM IT THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALSO FOSTERED BY THE CONCEPT OF GENIUS IT MAY BE THAT GENIUS IS FOSTERED BY A MUTATION OF A {society's / society is / society has} ILLS WITH ITS STRENGTHS GENIUS HAS A WAY OF AFFECTING SOCIETY DEEPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS ASL ALWAYS THE PRODUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL ANOTHER ASPECT OF GENIUS IS THAT IT IS AN IDEA THAT RETURNS TO ALL INDIVIDUALS OF VALUE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HELPING RESHAPE SOCIETY JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE AGE OF MACHINES HAS INTIMIDATED HUMAN BEINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DEMONSTRATE THE IMMENSE POTENTIAL POWER OF NOT INDIVIDUALIZING EQUIVALENCE OF MASS PRODUCED PARTS SOCIETY IS TEMPTED TO IMITATE THE POWERFUL MACHINE BY MAKING ITS MEMBERS CONFORM TO THEIR WAYS TO PRODUCING SO UNIFORMLY OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL SOON realiseS THE VALUE IN LEARNING WHAT ARE THE ASPECTS OF NON RES REPRODUCIBILITY WHICH ARE A VALUE SEVEN TWENTY SIX ANXIOUS EMBATTLED SAME THING SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT i have LIVED WITH TIME SO LONG AS A LIMITING AND CONTROLLING REALITY THAT i am RUINED WITH THINKING OF IT LIKE THIS I NEED NEW IMAGES FOR TIME I AM TIRED OF BEING PUSHED IN FRONT OF IT LIKE A CHILD BEING URGED TO TAKE ITS FIRST STEP OR LIKE A PET BEING DRAGGED ALONG ITS STACCATO STEPS LURCHING FORWARD ONE MOMENT AND THEN SEEMING TO DRAG ON FOREVER LOCKED IN A ROOM WAITING FOR ITS CHANCE TO GET OUT I CAN LEARN TO ACCEPT A CONCEPT OF TIME THAT IS INEXORABLE LEADING TO ONE INESCAPABLE OUTCOME BUT I CAN NEVER ACCEPT A MECHANICAL VIEW OF TIME THAT ALLOWS FOR NO INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE EIGHT SEVENTEEN EVERY PLACE HAS ITS ELSEWHERE ITS neighbour NOT YET COMPLETELY KNOWN ITS STRANGE PART WE THINK OF THE KNOWN AS THE CONQUISTAD CONQUISTADOR OF THE UNKNOWN TWO FAST TERRAI TWO VAST TERRAINS EACH PITCHED IN DARKNESS ONE ADVANCING ON THE OTHER AND THE OTHER IN GRAVE RETREAT PROBABLY A MORE APROPOS PORTRAYAL SUCH AS MAY EXIST BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE let us SAY ALLOWS FOR A MORE DYNAMIC YET WEBBED RELATIONSHIP THAN THAT AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE TWO QUOTE SIDES ARE EXCHANGING SOMETHING VITAL TO BOTH LIKE A HOT POTATO THAT NEITHER COMPLETELY WANTS YET NEITHER CAN COMPLETELY GET RID OF EITHER OVER TIME THE RELATIONSHIP TRANSFORMS BOTH AT THE BOUNDARY POINT BETWEEN THE TWO THERE ARE LEAKS CLUSTERS OF ORIGINATION THAT MIGHT ERUPT BRIEFLY BUT FREQUENTLY AT THIS PERIPHERAL ZONE THEN MELT AWAY
