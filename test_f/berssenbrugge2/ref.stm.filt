Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A Subject 0.154 439.929 SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORD FOR HAPPINESS THAT WAS FORMERLY INNOCENT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM WHEN STIMULATED PRODUCES A CHARACTERISTIC SIGN THE SINUS EXTENDS ITSELF DURING STRESS AND COLLAPSES SO THE A AUTOPSY FINDS ONLY A MEMBRANE TOUCHING A WALL PRODUCES THE SOUND OF TOUCH ON ANOTHER WALL FEEDBACK BETWEEN HEALTH AND FATE UNFOLDS SO FAST {there's / there is / there has} NO WAY ONE STEP IN THE CHAIN CAN BE BASED ON THE PREVIOUS ONE AN ASSOCIATED SMEAR OR AURA REQUIRES HER TO BE IN A BODY IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS LACK OF CLOUD COVER CAUSES THERMAL ENERGY ON THE DESERT TO RETURN RAPIDLY TO THE SKY AT NIGHT OXYGENATING MOLECULES MAKES LIGHT LIGHTING THE ORGANS THEY TURN WHITE {there's / there is / there has} A SPACE YOU SEE SOMETHING AT THE FAR EDGE AND YOUR EYE GOING OVER THIS SPACE MAKES A HOLE LIKE WATERY MASS IN A GOURD THE FEELING OF OLD ORGANS NO LONGER CRUCIAL TO OR INSIDE THEMSELVES WHILE REMEMBERING PEOPLE YOU LOVED WHICH FLOWED FROM THE PHYSICAL ABOUT WHICH YOU MADE DECISIONS TO MAKE THIS WHOLE ANY OBJECT BRINGS INTO BEING SOMETHING NOT IN NATURE AN INTERIOR MEASUREMENT YOURSELF NOT YOURSELF BURSTS OF GROWTH WHEN YOU SLEEP HER BACK BLEEDS A SPRAY OF BLOOD ON THE SNOW SHE SITS ON HER HANDS PHYSICALLY PREVENTING HERSELF FROM SCRATCHING THE CHILD HER SENSE OF THE WORLD BEING CRUCIAL TO OR INSIDE ITSELF OF MEMORY AND SPECIFICITY LIKE SCRIPT THESE CELLS GROW FOR YEARS IN A PETRI DISH THE SICK IMMORTALIZED CELLS do not KNOW TO STOP GROWING WHERE YOUR EYE GOES OVER SPACE TO THE HORIZON MAKES A HOLE BUT WHERE THE SKY MEETS THE EARTH THE FRAGMENT IS NOT THE SAME AS A WHOLE DESERT FERNS COVERED WITH REFLECTING HAIR MAY INSULATE THE FRONDS RADIATIONS OF A STATE THOROUGHLY EMBODIED AND DISSOLVING ENCOUNTER REFLECTIONS OF LIGHT THERE IS AN ENGINE HE can not SEPARATE FROM THE LOVED PERSON TO SHED THE LOVED BODY SO THIS IS THE FIRST POEM I I WROTE SINCE I FINISHED THE FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL MANUSCRIPT IT HAS A MORE NARRATIVE STYLE {it's / it is / it has} CALLED SUSIE KIKI ANNIE AND {it's / it is / it has} IN THREE PARTS SUSIE KIKI ANNIE ON ITS OWN TERMS MY PROJECT WITH THEM DEVELOPED A GENTLE MOMENTUM THE VULNERABILITY OF THEIR SITUATION ENGENDERED BY AN UNASSUMING SPIRIT OF PLAY AND TOGETHERNESS ON MY WAY TO WORK i have HAD SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS STANDING IN A GROUP CLOSE TOGETHER I ASKED EACH ONE TO TELL ME HIS OR HER THOUGHTS AND I TRIED TO REMEMBER THEM ALL MY SISTER HAS JUST FIXED THE MOTORCYCLE OF HER FRIEND TOM AND { she's / she was / she is / she has} WAITING FOR HIM AMONG THEM A FOX TURNS TO LOOK AT ME AS IF IN NATURE BUT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DRAWN IT {it's / it is / it has} SYMBOLIC WHAT CAN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE MY SISTER ENCOMPASS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL IF SHE WERE NOT MY SISTER OR IF I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORMAL RELATION A PROJECTOR IN THE DARK CASTS A LINE OF LIGHT UNDER THE DOOR ENERGY OF THE GAP BETWEEN MY SISTER AND THE STRATEGY THAT CONSTRUES HER AS PURE APPEARANCE DISPERSES ALONG THE WEB OF FAMILY INTERRELATIONS {there's / there is / there has} A STRINGENT PHYSICAL LINK BUT WHAT GOES ON INSIDE HER SEEMS CLOSE TO FREEDOM I KNOW AS MY POWER OF IMAGINATION SO STRONG IT APPEARS AS A DELIBERATE LOSS OF INFORMATION ONE FOX AN OPEN STRUCTURE EMPTIES LIKE A FUNNEL ONE FOX ENTERS THE WORLD IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN IMAGE {there's / there is / there has} A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM IN WHICH SHE IS INVOLVED WALKING BETWEEN ANIMALS ASLEEP AND LATE LIGHT LIKE BLOOD UNINTERESTED IN THE ALLEGED REALISM OF THE FOX WHILE SHE SEES IT AS ACTUALLY BEHIND THE SCENES THEY WATCH ME IN SUSPENSE THERE IS A MUTE PROBABILITY OF A RECIPROCAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING LATELY i have BEEN INTERESTED IN FAILING TO MAKE SOMETHING EXCITING EQUATING THE ACT OF WALKING FROM ONE TREE TO ANOTHER WITH UNDERSTANDING I TRY TO SPEAK TO HER IN A WAY IN WHICH SHE MIGHT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY AND ANSWER BACK THE SITUATION IS AN IMAGE OF HER GATHERING A TOY HORSE FROM BESIDE EACH CANDLE OF MY SISTER ON A WHITE HORSE OF THE HORSE STEPPING BACKWARDS IN WATER SHE STANDS THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND TAKES OUT OF HER POCKET ONE OF THE TOY HORSES SHE TELLS ME ABOUT IT AS IF I WERE ALSO A LOVER OF HORSES BUT I AM NOT AS SHE WELL KNOWS THE WAY IN WHICH SHE SHARES HER HAPPINESS AS A MATTER OF COURSE GIVES ME A SENSE OF GUILT BECAUSE I DO NOT FEEL THE HAPPINESS ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE STORY WHO EVENTUALLY DIE CONSIST OF TINY LINES SCRATCHED INTO REDDISH GROUND THE WHITE OF AN EYE IS SCRATCHED AWAY BUT THE PUPIL IS INK MANY APPEAR SLEEPY AS IF THEY HAD JUST WAKENED UP SQUIRREL LITTLE CAT FAWN SHE WEARS AN OILY SMOCK AND CLOTHES WITH A RUBBER DAISY ON EACH ONE LIGHT GLINTS OFF HER GLASSES AS SHE WAITS WITH AN AWKWARDNESS {that's / that is / that has} BOTH CONSPICUOUS AND NONCHALANT SHE FEELS THEIR PRESENCE IN THE WOODS AS AN A PRIORI MODEL LIGHT SUBJECT TO DECLINE HER EMPATHY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO READ THE STORY AND SEE IT AS A PICTURE AT THE SAME TIME IS THIS STORY OF DEFEAT AND DISAPPOINTMENT UNCERTAINTY INTERFERENCE MALFUNCTION TRANSCENDED BY THE PRESENT SITUATION OF COMPETENT EMPLOYMENT SHE LOSES TRACK OF HER THOUGHT THEN RESUMES AFTER LAUGHING AT HERSELF THE HORSE TAKES A SMALL JUMP IN THE AIR AND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARCH BACK I SEE MINNIE MOUSE INSTEAD OF A THIN GIRL IN A COTTON SMOCK THE AMBIGUITY RELEASES ENERGY NO ONE ENTERS THE FAMILY UNIT EXCEPT THROUGH THE MAGNETISM OF THIS ENERGY STOLID GIRLS SCOUT LIKE AN OLD MAN WILD GIRLS IN A MEADOW IN THE AFTERNOON ARE SUBJECT TO AN EVALUATION IN WHICH CHEAPNESS can not BE AVOIDED SHE MARKS TIME WITH HER HAND AND THE HORSE CURLS ITS NECK AND HEAD AROUND HER
