Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A Subject 8.762 403.619 i am GOING TO READ JUST ONE POEM FOR MY SECOND TIME AROUND {it's / it is / it has} A LONG POEM WHICH IS TO SAY A LONG POEM FOR ME A LONGISH POEM FOR A LONG TIME WHAT I WANTED TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS TO GET POEMS SHORTER AND SHORTER AND SHORTER AND THEN I DISCOVERED I WAS TOO SUCCESSFUL I STOPPED WRITING COMPLETELY AND SILENCE WAS GREAT BUT I was not HAPPY WITH IT THIS IS THE NEWEST POEM I HAVE WRITTEN {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} A POEM WHICH I WRESTLED WITH FOR A LONG TIME AND PUT AWAY UNTOUCHED AND THEN I WAS ASKED VERY RECENTLY IF I WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A BOOK INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR CHILDREN AND THIS SENT ME BACK TO THIS POEM AGAIN WHICH IS A FAIRY TALE POEM THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME AT ALL KNOW THAT ONE OF THE OVERWHELMING INTERESTS OF MY LIFE IS FAIRY TALES AND FOR MANY YEARS I TRIED TO TURN MY favourITE HORRIFIC FAIRY TALE WHICH IS CALLED THE JUNIPER TREE INTO VERSE I WAS TOTALLY UNSUCCESSFUL AT DOING THIS AND i have ENDED UP DOING A B A A FAIRY FROM AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT TRADITION i am HAPPY THAT I HAVE SOME JAPANESE FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS POEM IS IN FACT A POEM BASED ON AN OLD JAPANESE FAIRY TALE WHICH IS CALLED MOMOTARO OR THE PEACH BOY I do not KNOW WHETHER ANY OF YOU HERE KNOW IT OR MANY OF YOU HERE KNOW IT BUT IT IS A POEM WHICH ALWAYS DEEPLY MOVED ME ONCE MANY YEARS AGO I WAS SET TO LEARNING JAPANESE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY AS A MATTER OF FACT AND THE ONLY THING I READ OF ALL THE MATERIAL THAT WE WENT THROUGH IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING JAPANESE THAT EVER STAYED IN MY HEAD WAS THIS STORY I COULD STILL HEAR IT GOING IN MY HEAD FOR INSTANCE THE NOISE THAT THE PEACH OUT OF WHICH THE LITTLE BOY COMES MAKES AS IT TURNS OVER AND OVER IN THE RIVER DONBURI DONBURI DONBURI I CAN HEAR THE {boy's / boy is / boy has} MOTHER TALKING TO HIM AS SHE LOADS HIM UP WITH KIBI DANGO MILLET SEED CAKES THE BEST KIBI DANGO IN ALL JAPAN AND I CAN HEAR THE ANIMALS WHO STOPPED HIM i have FORGOTTEN ALL THE MILITARY JAPANESE I EVER KNEW I {can not / cannot} TELL YOU THE WORD FOR A BATTLESHIP OR A GUN OR AN EMPLACEMENT OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT I CAN T PROBABLY TELL YOU THIS STORY IN JAPANESE THOUGH ALL THE REST OF IT IS DEPARTED FROM ME AND {i had / i would} WANTED TO WORK IT AND REWORK IT AND i have TRIED TRIED TO FIND A FORM FOR IT AND IT FINALLY OCCURRED TO ME AS I UNDER WITH THIS SIC YOU SEE {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A LONG {it's / it is / it has} ONLY ONE POEM i am GOING TO READ SO I HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR A LONG INTRODUCTION RIGHT AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE FORM FOR THIS POEM I DECIDED I WOULD RETURN TO A VERY ANCIENT AND honourable FORM VERY FLEXIBLE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL DOGGEREL THIS IS A POEM WHICH IS WRITTEN IN DOGGEREL I DEARLY LOVE A RHYME i will DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD FOR A RHYME AND I do not MUCH CARE HOW FAST OR HOW SLOW I GET TO IT IN THE LINE THE INTERESTING THING WHICH HAPPENED TO THIS STORY WHICH ORIGINALLY HAD A HAPPY ENDING PEACH BOY GOES OUT AND HE GOES TO THE ONIGASHIMA THE ISLAND OF THE DEVILS AND HE CONQUERS THE KING OF THE DEMONS DEVILS what ever YOU CALL THEM MONSTERS AND HE COMES BACK HOME MAKES HIS FAMILY HAPPY AND HE LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER BUT AS I WROTE THIS POEM I DISCOVERED THAT THE ENDING OF IT INSISTED ON CHANGING AND I could not FINISH IT UNTIL I CHANGED THE ENDING AND THIS FINALLY TURNED OUT THEN TO BE A POEM NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT WHICH IS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF FINDING A PROPER NAME FOR EVERYTHING ANYTHING THIS IS A POEM ABOUT NAMING BUT IT ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE A POEM ABOUT HEROISM AN ANTIHEROIC POEM AND I SUPPOSE THE REASON IT BECAME AN ANTIHEROIC POEM IS BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE WHICH I LEARNED READING THE STORY OF THE LITTLE PEACH BOY I ENDED UP USING ON THE ISLAND OF IWO JIMA AND TOO MANY BAD CONNOTATIONS ARE CONNECTED WITH IT ANYHOW I THINK ALL CHILDREN ALWAYS KNOW THAT THE SO CALLED HAPPY ENDINGS OF FAIRY TALES ARE LIES RIGHT BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT {we are / we were} COURTEOUS ENOUGH TO LIE TO THEM AND PRETEND THAT WE THINK THEY BELIEVE IN {us / u. s.} WHEN WE TELL THEM THAT EVERYBODY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER you will SEE NOBODY LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER IN THIS {it's / it is / it has} DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS WHICH ARE THE PARTS OF THE STORY THE FIRST PART OF MOMOTARO OR THE PEACH BOY THEN IS CALLED THE FINDING OF THE PEACH AN OLD WOODCHOPPER AND HIS OLD OLD WIFE LIVED IN THE FOREST FOR ALL OF THEIR LIFE AND THE NAME OF THE CHOPPER WAS CHOPPER AND THE NAME OF HIS WIFE WAS WIFE AND THE NAME OF THE DAYS THEY LIVED WAS DAY AND THE NAME OF THE NIGHTS WAS NIGHT BUT THE NAME OF THE SUM OF THEM ALL WAS PAIN FOR THEY HAD BORNE NO CHILD TO BEAR THEIR NAME UNTIL CROUCHED ONE DAY BY THE BANK OF THE STREAM WASHING HER WASH AND DREAMING HER DREAM THE OLD WOMAN SAW A GIANT PEACH AFLOAT ON THE WATER JUST OUT OF HER REACH OVER AND OVER IT TURNED AND THE SUN SINGING A SONG OR HUMMING A HUM DONBURI DONBURI REACH OUT YOUR HAND WHAT IS BORNE IN THE WATER MAY LIVE ON THE LAND WHAT BEGINS AS A PEACH MAY END AS A MAN SO WET YOUR FEET AND CATCH WHAT YOU CAN LIKE A CHILD SHE CLUTCHED IT CLUTCHED AT THE PEACH SOMETHING TO FONDLE OR SOMETHING TO EAT LIKE A CHILD SHE HELD IT TIGHT TO HER BREAST BUT KNOWING NO NAMES HOW SHOULD SHE GUESS WHAT TO CALL IT OR WHAT WOULD COME NEXT PEACH SHE CALLED IT CARRYING IT HOME TO WHERE THE OLD MAN WAITED ALONE PART TWO IS CALLED THE CUTTING OF THE PEACH i will CUT IT SAID THE OLD MAN SINCE CUTTING WAS HIS TRADE let us EAT WHAT LUCK HAS BROUGHT {us / u. s.} WHY SHOULD WE BE AFRAID BUT HIS WIFE WAS LOST IN WONDER AND TALK THOUGH NOT HER TRADE WAS WHAT SHE DID WHEN SHE WAS NOT HANGING IN A GLADE THEIR WASH OR THE WASH OF OTHERS OR MENDING WHAT WAS FRAYED HOLD OFF SHE CRIED OR LET ME who have HELD IT TO MY BREAST DRAW THE KNIFE ACROSS ITS SKIN AS SOFT AS A CARESS
