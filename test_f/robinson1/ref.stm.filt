THOUGH IT IS UNINTENTIONAL ON HOMOPHONIC TERRAIN WHICH OR WITCH SOMETHING TRAILS ALONG AFTER THEM SLIGHT BUT NOT DWINDLING WHILE THE WATER LAPS AT THE LIPS NOW AWAY AND NOW OPEN ONE A PORTAL AND THE OTHER A SPELL AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND I I WAS C CERTAIN THAT I WAS WRITING FICTION BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD SINCE THAT IT IS NOT FICTION THIS IS AS CLOSE TO FICTION AS I BELIEVE I CAN COME {it's / it is / it has} CALLED CROW AND ROBIN NEARBY I HEAR THE SOUND OF WOOD PLANKS CLUNKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THROUGH THE TREES COMES THE CLACK OF HAMMERS some timeS A BUZZSAW THE MAN LAUGHS AND SAYS HAVE YOU EVER MURDERED A MAN HIS co worker MAKES NO REPLY THE MAN BEGINS TO SING A SONG BUT STOPS INTERRUPTING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN LAUGHTER AT HOME I SIT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AND LOOK OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE neighbour'S GARDEN I THINK ABOUT YOU RATHER I IMAGINE THAT I AM YOU WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF THE RAGGED PEONIES AND WHY THE neighbour WHY has not THE neighbour CUT THEM BACK AS THEY DIE FROM INSIDE YOUR BODY HOW DO PEONIES SMELL I AM EMBARRASSED BY THE LIMITS OF IMAGINATION THAT IS HOW MY DESIRE FAILS AS EMPATHY AND SETTLES INTO VOYEURISM HAVE YOU EVER DEADHEADED A PEONY I WANT TO KNOW NOT HOW THE OLD FELTED BROWNING PETALS FEEL BUT HOW THEY FEEL TO YOUR FINGERTIPS I WONDER IF {i had / i would} ASK A STRANGER AS YOU MUST ULTIMATELY BE A QUESTION ARISING OUT OF GENUINE CURIOSITY I WONDER IF {i had / i would} DARE TO TRESPASS INTO MY neighbour'S FLOWERBED AND CUT DOWN HER UGLY USED UP FLOWERS ACROSS THE STREET GRIFFIN GRIFFIN IS THREE AND A HALF HE WALKS TO THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY HOLDING A BOUNCY BALL HE AIMS CAREFULLY AND THEN SETS THE BALL DOWN TO ROLL IT THE BALL ROLLS EVENLY GRIFFIN'S ONE YEAR OLD SISTER TOTTERS CAREFULLY TOWARD HER BROTHER ON HER NEW WALKING LEGS THE BALL CONNECTS WITH HER SHINS BRINGING HER TO HER KNEES HER FACE BOUNCES DOWN AND THEN OFF THE BALL GRIFFIN RETRIEVES THE BALL AND WALKS BACK TO THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY STARTING AGAIN GRIFFIN HONEY CALLS A BABYSITTER GRIFFIN I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY BUT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR TWO BIRDS SQUABBLE ONE IS A ROBIN AND THE OTHER LOOKS TO BE A CROW BIG AND AGGRESSIVE THE ROBIN IS GETTING BEAT UP BUT STANDS ITS GROUND A HUGE GUST OF WIND CAUSES THE BOUGH TO MOVE FROM DUE NORTH TO DUE EAST THE BIRDS ROTATE BEFORE MY EYES PARALLEL WITH ME THE WIND CARRIES THE PACKAGE OF ITSELF ON THE ARGUING BIRD VOICES UNTIL A PEDESTRIAN WALKS BY AND THE CROW IS STARTLED SLIDES OFF THE BOUGH AND GOES AWAY I WANTED THE CROW TO BE ASHAMED TO LEAVE THE BRANCH ASHAMED THAT IT HAD FORCED ITSELF ON ANOTHER BIRD'S HOME THEN I realiseD THAT I AM THE CROW AND YOU ARE THE ROBIN AND A SENSE OF ADORATION AND ADMIRATION SPREADS THROUGH ME LIKE A NEW VERSION OF THE WEATHER THE CROW COMES BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND I HEAR THE RAISED VOICES OF THE BIRDS MERGING WITH THE BIGGER AGITATED VOICE OF THE WIND IS IT REALLY WRONG TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE THAT WILL PROVE WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE ANYWAY I OFTEN FIND WHAT i am LOOKING FOR ON A CHAIN OF CONTINUITY THE LEADING TO OR FOLLOWING FROM HERE IN THE SEQUENCE OF REASON PROOF THAT THINGS MAY BE CONNECTED OFF KILTER with out THERE ARE REALIZING THE LINK THIS MORNING AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO I HEARD THIS STORY A SEMI TRUCK IS PULLING OUT OF A GAS STATION DRIVEWAY JUST AS IT PULLS OUT ONTO THE STREET A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR ROLLS IN FRONT OF IT AND GETS STUCK IN THE GRILL OF THE TRUCK THE TRUCK DRIVER DRIVES FOUR MILES AT SPEEDS OF UP TO FIFTY MILES PER HOUR COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF HIS FRONT LOADED PASSENGER WHEN THE TRUCK FINALLY STOPS THE WHEELCHAIR IS DETACHED FROM THE TRUCK AND ITS OCCUPANT IS UNHARMED HE DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE AS QUITE A RIDE THAT WAS ON NPR TOO I WILL SAY COULD THERE BE MORE TO THE CROW THAN ITS OBNOXIOUSNESS does not IT TOO HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HUNGRY TO NEED SHELTER I WATCH IT TRYING TO GET ITS GLOSSY HEAD INTO THE BIRD FEEDER MEANT FOR FINCHES AND SPARROWS VERY SMART IF I WERE THE STAND IN FOR THE CROW THEN COULD I CONVINCE SOMEONE TO LOVE ME I IMAGINE WATCHING YOU WATCH THE CROW YOUR GOOD HUMOR BUT YOUR SENSE ULTIMATELY THAT THIS BIRD IS NOT SUBTLE A PEST YOU THINK IT SHOULD BLOW AWAY IN A SUMMERY GUST COMING HOME FROM WORK I SEE MY YOUNG neighbour GRIFFIN RUNNING UP THE EMPTY SIDEWALK LOOKING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS THOUGH I THINK WITH AMUSEMENT THERE WAS SOMEONE FOLLOWING HIM I AM RAKING UP THE FALLEN MESS OF LEAVES AND STICKS IN THE YARD WHEN I NOTICE THAT THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR IS CARRYING STICKS AND BRANCHES OUT TO THE CURB WE BOTH CONTINUE with out ACKNOWLEDGING EACH OTHER AFTER A WHILE I SEE THE MAN ACROSS THE STREET SAWING OFF A HALF BROKEN BRANCH FROM A TREE AND THEN THAT ANOTHER neighbour IS SILENTLY RAKING UP DEBRIS FROM THE STORM FAR DOWN THE STREET SOME DAY labourERS ARE TALKING ANIMATEDLY IN SPANISH OTHERWISE THERE ARE NO HUMAN VOICES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I WAKE UP TO TERRIFIED SCREAMING ONE CREATURE PREYS UPON ANOTHER AND AFTER THE SCREAMS QUITE NEAR THE WOUNDED ANIMAL TAKES UP A DESPERATE SNORING BREATHING I TURN ON THE PORCH LIGHT AND THE BREATHING STOPS THEN STARTS AGAIN MORE IRREGULAR I {can not / cannot} SEE WHAT IS OUT THERE EVEN THOUGH THE SOUND OF IT IS SO SHARP THAT {it's / it is / it has} IN MY NOSTRILS AND ON MY TONGUE I WISH YOU WERE HERE TO COMFORT ME BUT I MAKE MY FEAR CORRECT ITSELF I WOULD BE YOU THE SELF AT A LOSS THE INVISIBLE HAND THAT RESTS ON THE SHOULDER OF ITS OWN BODY GUIDING IT
