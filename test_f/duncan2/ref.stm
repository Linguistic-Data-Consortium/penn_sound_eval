Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A Subject 0.205 406.897 But but but she  I think that you  that she's designedly in a way wanting to be there Well wh wh  but and and laying claim uh It's one of the places where you began the Eupheries because you realized it's something you laid on you because it's not coming from this but but that that so her gnomic will be Now I know more than you do you little twerp And and the and the rune will be  I mean  And and gnomic in Emily Dickinson does not mean she knows something It means something  also It  no the the language knows something she's not going to  I mean uh this is the way I I don't  she kno she knows plenty but that's not what we're enc enc encountered that's so strange nor what she encounters She'll go into speak from something she knows but to bring us clearly to the place where we are at the rune and then the  and rune is to evoke runic gnomic is some utterance that that that i is very close to enigma and i is different from s symbol eni Enigma is something that cannot be transferred into metaphor So I'm talking about the metaphoric here in good degree when I go through these themes that are constantly operating in metaphor One of the things that draws her to him is that she also experiences him as e enigmatic They rearrive and and refuse a as I sai  so we're in the presence of a no  a a a metaphor that can't be located that we begin to realize is metaphorical because it has no location and meanwhile there is an eni  an absolutely gnawing annoying a a a a necessity for a location somewhere So place uh the unloo  uh has a lot uh and v  is very telling here The sea for instance and over beyond there  in horizon and beyond horizon uh uh are are not global as they are in in in uh uh in Whitman Although she's got experien  she's  I think in the early poem she has she has several references Columbus encircling sea encircling the globe as such globe is there in her mind but not not when she's going over there not when she's going to another land or another place Well this one little poem is not only  what I w wanted to speak about in the way of  though of her striking the gnomic and the rune both go by being very striking and she begins to have a language which is d  like Spencer's  Absolutely j  her she has a tense that looks subjunctive uh Yeah uh we'll find that And then she also ha  will will strike out on her own fo for the serpent's figure glid stealthily along No accident at all I've got I think two versions of this There there it is featured terms are themselves terms standing not symbols standing for something that comes immediately into question on and and and and openly into question what does that mean uh But now rune is the one that evokes this Rune evokes uh uh uh wh wh where where gno gnomic's um  a gnomic covers in some way Or or it's uh like a husk of something that you can't get at Rune is to call up the the the thing is vis visitation to encount  to call up the encounter with the thing an and that is very frequent mode These are the modes in Emily Dickinson You find prayer certainly in in in the terror and and and  I mean all her life she inhabited a uh a realm in poetry that needs prayer so we'll find prayer an And uh an an and uh  and an absolute certainty that that's where she is mystic A certainty that she'd got to dwell there But this one little poem is e  uh uh just an extraordinary moment and there are several of this kind uh uh uh uh Following that one in number ten is is just its opening lines My wheel is in the dark I cannot see a spoke yet know its dripping feet go round and round My foot is on the tide an unfrequented road yet have all roads a clearing at the end One has resigned the loom Some have resigned the loom some in the busy tomb find quaint employ some with new stately feet pass royal through the gate flinging the problem back at you and I Now that's again this at you and I this this this  uh I is striking enough when you look at the titles of her poems I mean I uh the the the an an and and so she's the other end of uh if if p reali  think how near she is to Debbie who didn't want the I there so the I must be remembered all the time And it must be remembered all the time at the cost of saying at you and I uh she  in in in back to her letter to Higginson I I didn't go to  she went to schools alright but in the sense you mea  I mean in a sense no matter what school she went to the poem so invade every level that that she is not making mistake when at You and I because I is the name of a person This is  that was  Susan observes a Me is Mark likely to be the one you heard that other book people the I never belonged to you now i  now only by visitation does I  have we got a car again parked around  okay Now I need to get to chemistry classes classes sorry Oh Mhm And and and and uh the  and and this is thi  everybody has faces right They don't dream that she's not  I mean she she doesn't leave you room to think Oh she's made a slip or she did  or or for instance uh did she do it uh did she do it for rhyme there uh Canter um  and uh we'll take take a look at where  that was number ten was it Hm Yes No no way Mmmm No way absolutely just I Exclamation point uh i in case you missed the the You and I Well uh uh uh actually she might be rhyming it with employ or she does it was her line Mhm I  But me would've been an uh absolute rhyme for employ and I is a very jarring one indeed She likes jarring rhymes but me would've been a a  I mean not w  me would've been very typical of her employ and we know she's  it's I is the name of somebody because me is the name of somebody too for her Now it's   so her shifters are re are real persons within the poetry This is what I've been  I get at an and and I don't mean that she thought a heavy trip around but she must've recognized what she was doing At You and I
