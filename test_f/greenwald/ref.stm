Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A Subject 0.207 349.904 Nowadays I'm more or less content to let a lot of things take their own courses like amiable rivers making blue lines down the map of history I'm not saying that some things don't infuriate me They certainly do But I've learned mostly through stupid repetition the same patience I apply to my own works Moving them out of range of good and evil is applicable in a romantic way I guess to things natural and unnatural Outside myself I'm on better terms though still able to bear grudges with most things and people more social socially amiable no longer stand in a corner at parties facing into the wall smelling the school like plaster getting plastered Now I talk it up and even when down never talk down but remain subdued I've learned to like winters more but hate the end of same feel relief at spring crave sun on body enter through the lobby of annual depression have greater sense of personal comfort expanding horizons ability to survive and know how far I'll go to do in this year of famine and pestilence have learned to keep my mind and ear cocked like a gun for the true poetry of the language to go off and fill the sky of the mind with angels conversing and have enough memory left to remember and write the angels down without pinning a single body or wing I have finally returned to the cheerfulness I had when very young before the bubbles in my personal seltzer had gone flat when the fingers of school having opened my thinking pat   having opened my thinking cap kept the bottle open long enough to let the fun out amidst the multitude of others asking one way or another Whatever happened to you You were such a cheerful kid And that I am Whiff An evening spent talking spent thinking about what my life would be if I'd stayed with a particular girl or woman I went with what would be if I'd have been accepted to and gone where I applied to a different school than the one I did where I'd learn different social graces than the ones I have where some of the material values of the American Dream had rubbed off enough to make me live it out in the good work sense If I'd settled down and settled for the foundation on a house for future generations instead of assuming immediate  immediately past generations my foundation to mine If I'd have been a little quicker to learn what was expected of me and wanting to please pleased going on that way through all eternity I've probably been saved from mere routines by a streak of stubbornness by a slow mind and tendency to drift by an emotional development that requires my personal understanding before happening feeling out the implications an emotion has in form of expectation before trying out and after awareness I sense a willingness to tell someone I know and like and sense the same from anything they'd like to know about me and at the same time have a vast sense of privacy which means there's no way I'll wear out my personality and its sense of continuity although sometimes I feel empty But talking to someone I like and trust and sense the same from I feel way up and after a long evening of talk about this and that feel wide awake and feel the world wide and awake around me and have a visual intensity and memory that in near memory dulls and throbs and grows vivid as hell When I bring it to mind some time from then what my life would've been like under different circumstances it would've been different with its own attendant ifs and its own what might have been But this way I've elected to follow and cast my vote each waking day in I avoid the possibility of taking the past too seriously or feeling any bitterness or sadness This way when my ship comes in I'll have passed out of mind beyond the sight of land and won't hesitate for a second to look back on all this with fondness or remiss The air'll be clear the moon'll be there and you whoever you are and hope to be will be here with my love Ninth Street Old people old people large clouds high with expanses of high blue palm frond huts white buildings blue trim sea green tiles everybody walks slow they seem the women have the same white sweater the men have the same white shirt bellies very green grass and palms Everyone has a hunch They're moving their life into the road of the shoulder of life Water cool enough to refresh thigh deep out far from the lighter greens to the darker green head for the green blue more women than men no smiles visions of the endless end of life visions of Holocausts how easy it is to have visions whitened buildings growing wider and pulsing in the blue  in the white pulse of the sun Visions of the beginning and end of work visions of palms waving goodbye and the sky reading me up with waving palms light gray pebbles streets highways and big hotels big and little white curves yellow light the same yellow as light through window shades only no shades blinds jealousies cool breezes blowing through the moisture from the sea very little talking only talk fervent deals and wheels emphatic gestures into tubby waistbands temple chance grazing my temple through speakers as some misters and a missus pass the microphone visions of vegetable stands movies changing three times a week lavender blue hair blue gray hair gray green water with a middle layer of halo green staring up at bridges cars trucks buses fishermen looking down straight in the deep and reeling the lure in visions of curves and angles going every which way keeping me awake longer than usual each night until sleep takes me over over the water with deep blue lights through memory of the land with puffs of light green snow laid out neatly as far as the eye can see over the shoulder visions arriving over the shoulder like gulls visions sitting and waiting for the beach to empty and the sun to enter the lost and found And this is the last poem We are in a strange country We are sitting in a room full of strangers having a meal
