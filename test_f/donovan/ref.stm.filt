SEE THE WORLD TAKE MANY NOTES LAST WINTER I HAD THE PLEASURE OF COMPOSING A SOMATIC EXERCISE WITH MY FRIEND C A CONRAD OUR EXERCISE WAS BASED ON DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY CELLIST ARTHUR RUSSELL'S MASTERPIECE WORLD OF ECHO IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE RUSSELL'S WORLD OF ECHO FOR ANYONE WHO has not HEARD IT BEFORE IT HAS A RARE SPIRITUAL QUALITY WHICH ISSUES FROM RUSSELL'S SONGWRITING VOICE AND CELLO PLAYING BUT ALSO FROM THE PRODUCTION VALUES OF THE ALBUM PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE FROM TIM {lawrence's / lawrence is / lawrence has} BIOGRAPHY OF RUSSELL HOLD ONTO YOUR DREAMS MAKES PALPABLE RUSSELL'S SUBTLE ACCIDENTAL STUDIO PROCESSES DURING THESE SESSIONS IT BECAME STANDARD FOR ARTHUR TO SPLICE TOGETHER SEPARATE TAPES AND HE WOULD REGULARLY GRAB A TRACK FROM ONE TAPE AND FLY IT INTO THE MULTITRACK OF ANOTHER WHILE HIS ONLOOKING ENGINEER TRIED TO STAY CALM QUOTE WE WOULD BE MIXING ON A PIECE OF TAPE AND I WOULD SEE THE SPLICE GO BY RECALLS ERIC LILJESTRAND IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING I COULD NEVER REALLY TELL WHAT WE WERE WORKING ON UNTIL IT WAS DONE UNQUOTE THE GHOSTLY ACCIDENTS THAT AROSE FROM ARTHUR'S INSISTENCE THAT THEY RERECORD OVER OLD TAPE BECAME BECAME AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SONIC FABRIC AT ONE POINT CONRAD TOLD ME THAT HE USED THE ALBUM TO HEAL A KNEE INJURY THAT HE HAD SUFFERED RUSSELL WAS TRAINED FOREMOST AS A MUSICIAN AND ONLY AFTERWARDS AS A BUDDHIST SO THE HEALING POWERS OF HIS MUSIC I CAN ONLY IMAGINE COME FROM THE CONFLUENCE OF THESE TWO DISCIPLINES FOR OUR EXERCISE CONRAD AND I DECIDED TO HAVE RUSSELL'S ALBUM PLAYING ON FOUR DIFFERENT STEREOS THROUGHOUT THE FIVE STORY HOUSE FOR A TWELVE HOUR DURATION TWELVE HOURS IS A LONG TIME TO DO ANYTHING AND ESPECIALLY TO LISTEN TO AN ALBUM TRIPLY ON REPEAT AMONG THE CONSTRAINTS I RECALL IMPOSING ON MYSELF MANY HAD TO DO WITH MEMORY TRYING TO FORGET THE LAST LINE I HAD WRITTEN BEFORE CONTINUING INTERRUPTING MYSELF MID LINE THEN PICKING UP WITH THE LINE AGAIN THESE EXERCISES IN INTENTION AND DISTRACTION I FELT WERE TRUE TO RUSSELL'S MUSIC SO WAS A CERTAIN CIRCULARITY THAT THE EXERCISES WERE TRYING TO INDUCE AMIDST INTERRUPTION AND DISJUNCTION WE ALSO SPENT MUCH OF THE NINE HOURS IMPROVISING LINES WITH A SET OF BOOKS I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME FROM NEW YORK CITY TO PHILADELPHIA MANY OF WHICH WERE OF A WHOLLY METAPHYSICAL OR MEDICAL IMPORT AMONG THESE BOOKS INCLUDED THE WRITINGS OF HENRY CORBIN AND HIS ACOLYTE CHRISTIAN JAMBET OLIVER SACKS'S SEEING VOICES MAURICE MERLEAU PONTY'S SELECTED WRITINGS ON PHENOMENOLOGY A COLLECTION OF GAELIC FOLKTALES AND BALLADS HELLEN KELLER'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY ROBERT KOCH'S RHUBARB AND THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD I ALSO REMEMBER READING A NUMBER OF RECENTLY PUBLISHED POETRY BOOKS INCLUDING JULES BOYKOFF'S COURAGEOUS HEGEMONIC LOVE POTION RUSSELL PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER COMPOSER {i had / i would} COME INTO CONTACT WITH UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF TUNING HIS BODY AND HIS MIND AS INSTRUMENTS COEVAL WITH HIS CELLO AND THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS DRUM MACHINES GUITAR TABLA HE WOULD USE THROUGHOUT HIS COMPOSITIONS VIA STUDIO PRODUCTION RUSSELL GAVE ACCESS TO THE OCCULT AND OTHERWORLDLY IN WAYS SIMILAR TO CONRAD'S USE OF HIS OWN BODY AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND VISION EXPLORED THROUGH THE SOMATIC EXERCISE AND TO CONCLUDE {i had / i would} LIKE TO READ MY CONTRIBUTION TO THIS LITTLE BOOK WHICH CONRAD HAS A FEW COPIES OF DEPENDENT ON BOOK HIM IMMEDIATELY AND AND CONRAD WILL READ HIS HIS CONTRIBUTION LATER ARTHUR ECHO MEANS INHABIT ENDS
