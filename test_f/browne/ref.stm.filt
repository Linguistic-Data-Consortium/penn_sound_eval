VARIOUS CULTURAL MALADIES AT THE MOMENT WORK IN PROGRESS SO STARTING WITH TWO QUOTATIONS FROM SHAKESPEARE SOME PRIVATE SCORPION DO YOU PONTIFICATE AND FROM SHELLEY A MIND THAT BROODS OVER GUILTY WOES IS LIKE A SCORPION GIRT BY FIRE SCORPION ODE I PRAY THE DICTIONARY I ASK PARDON OF DREAM I FEARED SCORPIONS IN THEIR SILENCE AND WALKED EACH MORNING INTO THE RISING MOUNTAIN I VOWED NOT TO BECOME THE NULLIFYING SILENCE BUT TO NULLIFY THE OTHER PARALYSIS BEING BORN TO SPEAK WITH THE ELEVATED PRECISION OF SILENCE FROM THE MARROW OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE LIVING ASPECT OF WHICH APPEARS SOLID BUT is not COMPLETE UNTIL WE HAVE LEFT THE WORD THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SCORPIONIC PREMISES DEPARTURE I SPEAK FROM ANOTHER VANTAGE THOUGH IT IS NOT MINE NOTHING IS ANYONE'S FORMALLY SPEAKING EVEN IF YOU WALK ALONG THIS PARTICULARITY OF GASPING ORDINATION A MIND IS MORE AKIN TO THE MOMENT IF YOU COULD HOLD IT AND WALK along side ME {i had / i would} BE SOMEWHERE DRIVEN TO THE PARTICLE WITHIN MINIATURE FLUCTUATIONS OF LIGHT NOT VISIBLE LIGHT BUT WHAT TURNS YOU AND PULLS YOU FROM YOUR BED ON A MORNING AS SUCH YOU WOULD RATHER NOT BE BIDDEN WAKEFUL REFRACTION IS THE MISSING TESTIMONY OF LEAVING WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND HOW WILL YOU GET THERE SCORPION ODE I WATCHED THE READER READ AND THE SCORES UPON CALENDARS LOOKED BACK UPON ME I TRIED TO READ FROM THE BOOK BUT EVEN MAGNIFIED I COULD NOT SEE IT
