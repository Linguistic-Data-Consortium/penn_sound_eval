Torres-Edwin_Complete-Recording_Interview_Copp-Street_San-Francisco_9-7-90 A Speaker1 0.21 434.825 So and I have these uh uh luscious x of almost abstract uh images because there there'll be  you know really x dramatic blowups of only fractions of photographs in the uh  in in uh uh magazines Yeah uh But you could  you'll be able to see like the uh  the the glass rim of uh the the vice president's uh you know just you know the corner of the uh  the the glass is the vice president x who is like uh uh Cardinal Richelieu you know he's like a power in  uh a power in the sh  in the shadow yeah uh or the sideburn of the prime minister you know the the  it was very funny because uh uh when he was elected he was x young he was in x his uh you know early forties  and uh then like overnight his his sideburns went white because you know they're like  x you know x respectability and you know like patina of uh inexperience or whatever x so that may be another one uh Then you may have seen another another picture the earring of uh Franco's uh granddaughter You know who was married to uh uh uh a French uh antique dealer or the smile of uh x almost like a Gioconda smile of uh Isabella Preysler who is a a notorious uh uh  kind of glorified courtesan that has been married to  first to a a a a pop singer Julio Iglesias who was uh uh uh uh her first husband then she married a a a count uh and then uh uh she married uh uh Boyer who at the time was uh like a super minister He was the minister of economics and and uh and finances and x probably the most powerful uh minister in Spain at the time x government and so she always kind of you know like uh uh uh uh maneuvers herself into associating herself with you know the most powerful men at the moment and uh so x So what part of her x uh The x the smile because she has this really like a Gioconda smile You know she looks like a porcelain uh uh uh doll She uh comes from a uh a Philippine family in a x the the Philippines were a Spanish uh dominion and all that and uh is very cold and very elegant and and and but at the same time just pure x x because x another thing that has happened in in in Spain is that uh um the uh uh politics and and high culture  and and uh and tabloid culture has all become completely mixed in a  indiscriminately mixed and and Like here uh but x even even more there It's really amazing I mean y you would you would buy uh a a magazine that would be the equivalent of uh  of Time Magazine or Newsweek and it's just appalling because uh at least x magazines  American magazines that they may be biased x and you know you can read very clearly between the lines you know where the ideology is and everything but they still talk about serious issues You know uh the main  at least the main the main uh features You know whatever happens in x is one international x talk about whoever yeah uh and the international uh uh uh you know affairs and so on uh but it d  never gets as low as as what uh the Spanish magazines uh uh or x and they claim that they have to x otherwise people don't buy them But uh I mean it's like they go to the point of of telling you who's living with with  x with with whom you know and uh in in in the government  you know  who who's mistress is you know x in a  in  in a  it's it's just a amazing you know um uh It's kind of like the National Enquirer crossed with x Oh yes but but the point is that you know it it's not the National Enquirer it's supposed to be Newsweek Mhm You know And uh that's one part x the oth  the other part of it is the the the socialist government in an attempt to uh uh associate themselves with um uh the most progressive you know uh uh and stylish and visible you know strata of society they they they they like to hang out with artist and and uh and singers and pop singers and you know so again but also has helped that that that sort of x not having a clear boundary w where you know the the party ends  and the and the and the real serious business begin Do you know x you know the book After the Great Divide I I heard of it x his whole thesis is that that's that's the signal of  that's postmodernism x modernism was Yeah I haven't read it though Yes this division between high and low and postmodernism is Mhm x disintegration of that Yeah Mhm um I should  I I want to have you talk about what's going to happen in Cambridge It's x x yeah mhm x and um what's  I mean the whit  the nineteen eighty nine Whitney Biennial controversy um Were you surprised by the controversy x blind x you didn't Yeah I was I was getting a x uh ready to to to fight a good one in Indianapolis Uh huh because I thought that that was going to uh to really  to uh uh make a big stink Uh huh and uh and nothing happened It didn't It didn't happen and uh and you know in the backyard you know  x totally unexpectedly then you know x thing just you know blow up in my face and and x you know It was a x surprise in New York x x Do you x I mean as you said before thought that there were  has there any  been any long term effects from  I mean um x  I don't know what there would be um as usual in those kinds of situations you've got a lot of extra free publicity M more people found out about the piece than would have found out about it if that wouldn't have happened Mhm um x it's it's a doubleedged thing because uh uh at at one point I I had to actually x tell the reporters when when they called if they were only interested in in the uh uh you know all the the big scandal and everything the fact that you know that two museums  or actually three museums were you know involved in the whole thing and they they only wanted th there to x there wasn't interested you know that they were only going to get my my side of the of the story if they were going to to talk about the piece Mhm but the content was and and x the work You know the the x Yeah The other thing that x I mean in in another kind of appropriation every time you saw the image in these articles about the controversy it was never the whole image No They didn't  they never included the x
