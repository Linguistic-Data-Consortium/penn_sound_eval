Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72 A Speaker1 0.53 412.196 x we x to make it x x inappropriate x you know like x I hope somebody's going to really think about the landform of the ponds because I mean it really could be special Yeah sure Technically you know the parameters of of technical requirements are really wide you know So you can have any  as long as you have a volume you can have x x any shape x Almost you have to have certain depths and certain x x and then the placement of where you put the ponds x Basically x Immediately x like to be able to walk among the x Oh did x Incredible numbers of birds x Oh that'd be terrific Oh yeah That should be x So that uh  just the x  I mean you should  the person who thinks of it has to think more like a x x yeah as a park  x x  x there x Yeah no matter what x be a lot of water Freshwater Lot of birdwatching too x x got  x when when will it be available for public sale  I don't know x don't know That's a really good question x I would think next spring You think that x x Anybody have a cigarette I x cigarette I'm not saying x trying get this x say yesterday what happened that was like I have uh x no no no no I have one thing to add x I thought it should be x literally should  time for um  at one point x okay Joanne that's x And you can get like uh  so you get a group sum and then what's in the group sum You have like a series of individual things happening I just don't x If you want you could cut out some x Group sum is the basis out of which the individual then gets to x x Which x x to say that people How would you like x Excuse me are kind of x they're not thinking to respond but they do I mean for example if you have when children grow up x you w  y you recognize this x parent or as the person that's involved with them that their language and modes of language change with incredible int intensity and rapidity I mean in fact for example when I  when one of my sons was very young he could  it wasn't that he could learn in the sense put his mind to but that he absorbed let's say the ability to speak French within you know very short time and then when we shipped him to Mallorca where the people were speaking Mallorquin primarily Oh x uh he for example within six months was out on the street mocking a French tourist with these Mallorquin kids not as a social x but because now he was in their language x and he he factually this French friend came to visit and all the Mallorquin kids would dance around and mocking his way of speaking and uh David among them So then this French friend knowing that he'd seen David six months before in France speaking impeccable French   said something to him in French and David had literally forgotten it So what I'm trying to say is that the  that that advent of sounds that are x the head is like an endless x is like a You don't have to try to do it When you're always writing in terms of the quote of the context in which it x Not really socially or psychologically but physically Like if you're up in the air you're writing x Okay x sure Okay x I'm still back on like uh the actual voicing of it which is um Yeah and certainly you've gone  I don't know how many poetry readings x you must have done endless amounts and they usually they come out x fairly flat and demanding a certain amount of concentration and some x the sound in it To me personally the m and I'm just trying to get the x like a music is a  rock music is a x people are aware of like Yeah how you can get x with sound Yeah and like uh poets now trying to like use part of that is like L l let's x trying to make the tone or the sound of poetry really start to move a lot more than like a translation from the page It goes too much like a  it goes back from a you get it you write it down and then your voice in a in a effort to make it come back to life again Right but the voice like can  it's like a reading voice to x and it just sounds like the the voice True isn't the voice of a person is it really alive and that's x No it slowed down last night Right and x I know they must have been ringing through his head Sure in that strange manner which he really x didn't x  didn't you find the x Yeah x for example x and I were reading this radio play together uh two days ago and one paradox that she noted I came out and say well w what do you think it sounded like since she has the socalled profess  no she has the actual professional knowledge of that whole x so I was thinking do you think it was okay I mean she would just mail it and I don't want to listen to it again you know  So you know anyhow she said yeah but x and she noted what was curious to her was that there's a section of this play in which one of the people speaking is is reading production notes for the actual performance of the socalled play and that's part of the play is reading these notes and the point is that I was x  I was reading those notes and she said what was funny was that when you were reading those notes you were you were x like you sounded like someone not really reading notes but your voice became very relaxed and x you were reading notes to me When you were reading the parts that were proposed as conversational interchange those were the parts that went peculiarly stilted and and not that you'd you know fuck them up entirely but those were the parts that didn't sound in that relaxed x  And one  again one damn dilemma as a writer or as a poet more accurately hopefully is that how to get the context to be that x in what you're reading so that the voice comes through x same way Because reading something has x possibilities well as  otherwise Yeah well I realized at your reading at that  it got into that cozy sense Well see I was x yeah of being just  being read to which is very soothing and relaxing I love that sense I suppose one of the real imprints on my own socalled consciousness would be the x being read to as a kid which was a beautifully x moment Mhm and also the sense which I've always been shy of but I've always truly hungered for is the reading where you're reading to four to five six friends Uh huh So that the residence is a completely uh clear  not clear but they really  have a really you know that
