Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974 A Subject 0.352 458.257 THE HISTORY OF SOMEONE WHO CAME TOO LATE THE TIME IS RIPE NOW AND THE ADAGE IS HATCHING AS THE SEASONS CHANGE AND TREMBLE IT IS FINALLY AS THOUGH THAT THING OF MONSTROUS INTEREST WERE HAPPENING IN THE SKY BUT THE SUN IS SETTING AND PREVENTS YOU FROM SEEING IT OUT OF NIGHT THE TOKEN EMERGES ITS LEAVES LIKE BIRDS ALIGHTING ALL AT ONCE UNDER A TREE TAKEN UP AND SHAKEN AGAIN PUT DOWN IN WEAK RAGE KNOWING AS THE BRAIN DOES IT CAN NEVER COME ABOUT NOT HERE NOT YESTERDAY IN THE PAST ONLY IN THE GAP OF TODAY FILLING ITSELF AS EMPTINESS IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE IDEA OF WHAT TIME IT IS WHEN THAT TIME HAS ALREADY PASSED SCHEHERAZADE UNSUPPORTED BY REASON'S ENIGMA WATER COLLECTS IN SQUARED STONE CATCH BASINS THE LAND IS DRY UNDER IT MOVES THE WATER FISH LIVE IN THE WELLS THE LEAVES A CONCERNED GREEN ARE SCRAWLED ON THE WHITE BAD BINDWEED AND RANK RAGWEED some how FORGET TO FLOURISH HERE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE WARDROBE HAS BEEN PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF EACH NEW OCCURENCE IT CAN BE ITSELF NOW DAYS ALMOST RELUCTANT TO DECLINE AND SLOWING DOWN OPENS OUT NEW AVENUES THAT do not INFRINGE ON SPACE BUT ARE LIVING HERE WITH {us / u. s.} OTHER DREAMS CAME AND LEFT WHILE A BANK OF COLORED VERBS AND ADJECTIVES WAS SHRINKING FROM THE LIGHT TO NURSE IN SHADE THEIR WANT OF A METHOD BUT MOST OF ALL SHE LOVED THE PARTICLES THAT TRANSFORMED OBJECTS OF THE SAME CATEGORY INTO PARTICULAR ONES EACH DISTINCT WITHIN AND APART FROM ITS OWN CLASS IN ALL THIS SPRINGING UP WAS NO HINT OF A TIDE ONLY A PLEASANT WAVERING OF THE AIR IN WHICH ALL THINGS SEEMED PRESENT WHETHER JUST PASSED OR SOON TO COME IT WAS ALL INVITATION SO MUCH THE FLOWERS OUTLINED ALONG THE NIGHT ALLEYS WHEN FEW WERE VISIBLE YET THEIR STORY SOUNDED LOUDER THAN THE HUM OF BUG AND STICK NOISES THAT BROUGHT UP THE REAR TRUNDLING IT ALONG INTO A NEW FACT OF DAY THESE WERE MEANT TO BE READ AS ANY SALUTATION BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS BUT THEY STUCK TO THEIR GUNS AND SO MUCH WITH THEIR OBSTINACY IN KEEPING WITH THE REST LIKE LONG FLASHES OF WHITE BIRDS THAT REFUSED TO DIE WHEN DAY DOES THAT NONE KNEW THE WARP WHICH PRESENTED THIS MAJOR MOVEMENT AS A FIRM DIGRESSION A PLAIN THAT SLOWLY BECOMES A MOUNTAIN SO EACH FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT IN A NET AS A FASHION AND ALL EFFORTS TO WRIGGLE FREE INVOLVED HIM FURTHER INEXORABLY SINCE ALL EXISTED THERE TO BE TOLD SHOT THROUGH FROM BORDER TO BORDER HERE WERE STONES THAT READ AS PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THERE WAS A STORY OF THE GRANDPARENTS OF THE VIGOROUS YOUNG CHAMPION THE LINES ONCE GIVEN TO ANOTHER NOW RESTORED TO THE NEW SPEAKER DINNERS AND ASSEMBLIES THE LIGHT IN THE OLD HOME THE SECRET WAYS THE ROOMS FED INTO EACH OTHER BUT ALL WAS WARINESS OF TIME WATCHING ITSELF FOR NOTHING IN THE COMPLEX STORY GREW OUTSIDE THE GREATNESS IN THE MOMENT OF TELLING STAYED UNRESOLVED UNTIL ITS WEALTH OF INCIDENT PAIN MIXED WITH PLEASURE FADED IN THE PRECISE MOMENT OF BURSTING INTO BLOOM ITS GROWTH A STATIC LAMENT SOME STORIES SURVIVE THE DYNASTY OF THE BUILDERS BUT THEIR ECHO WAS ITSELF LOCKED IN BECAME ANTICIPATION THAT WAS ONLY MEMORY AFTER ALL FOR THE POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITED IT IS SEEN AT THE END THAT THE KIND AND GOOD ARE REWARDED THAT THE UNJUST ONE IS DOOMED TO BURN FOREVER AROUND HIS ERROR SADDER AND WISER ANYWAY BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES THE OTHERS MUDDLED THROUGH LIKE {us / u. s.} UNCERTAIN BUT WEARING ARTLESSLY THEIR FUNCTION OF MINOR CHARACTERS WHO MUST BE KEPT IN MIND IT IS WE WHO MAKE THIS JUNGLE AND CALL IT SPACE NAMING EACH ROUTE EACH SERPENT FOR THE SOUND OF THE NAME AS IT CLINKS DULLY AGAINST OUR PLEASURE INDIFFERENCE THAT IS PLEASURE AND WOULD THEY BE with out AN AUDIENCE TO RESTRICT THE INNUMERABLE PASSES AND SWIPES RESTORED TO GOOD HUMOR AS IT ISSUES INTO THE IMPERVIOUS EVENING AIR SO IN SOME WAY ALTHOUGH THE ARITHMETIC IS INCORRECT THE BALANCE IS RESTORED BECAUSE IT BALANCES KNOWING IT PREVAILS AND THE MAN WHO MADE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE IS EXONERATED THE TOMB OF STUART MERRILL STUART MERRILL INCIDENTALLY WAS A NINETEENTH CENTURY AMERICAN POET WHO IMMIGRATED TO FRANCE AND BECAME A ONE OF THE THE S FRENCH SYMBOLIST POETS IT IS THE FIRST SOIR OF MARCH THEY HAVE TAKEN THE PLANTS AWAY MARTHA HOOPLE WANTED A BIG GNOSSIENNE HYDRANGEA SMELLING ALL OVER OF JICKY FOR HER CARD PARTY THE BASEMENT could not HOLD UP ALL THAT WILDNESS THE PETIT FOURS HAVE LEFT THEN UP AND SPAKE THE MAJOR THE NEW CONSERVATISM IS SITTING DOWN BESIDE YOU ONCE WHEN THE BUS SLID OUT PAST PLUS X I CAUGHT THE LENS COVER REFLECTION LILACS will not MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IT SAID OTHERWISE IN PARIS WHY YOU NEVER APPROVED MUCH OF MY PET REMEDIES I SPOKE ONCE OF A PALLIATIVE FOR PILES YOU would not TRY OR ADMIT TO TRYING ANY OTHER NOW WE LIVE with out OR RATHER WE GET ALONG with out EACH OTHER EACH OF {us / u. s.} DOES LIVE WITHIN THAT CONUNDRUM WE do not CALL LIVING BOTH SHUT UP AND OPEN CAN KNOWLEDGE EVER BE HARMFUL HOW ABOUT A MANDATE I THINK OF THROWING MYSELF ON THE MERCY OF THE COURT {they are / they were} BRINGING THE PLANTS BACK ONE BY ONE IN THE INTERSTICES OF HEAVEN EARTH AND TODAY I'V BECOME ATTRACTED TO YOUR STYLE YOU SEEM TO POSSESS WITHIN YOUR WORK AN AIR OF TOTAL FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND IMAGERY SOMEWHAT INTERESTING AND PUZZLING AFTER I READ ONE OF YOUR POEMS i am ALWAYS TEMPTED TO READ AND REREAD IT IT SEEMS THAT MY INEXPERIENCE HOLDS ME BACK FROM UNDERSTANDING YOUR MEANINGS I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU DO TO MAGNETIZE YOUR POETRY WHERE THE CURIOUS READER ALWAYS A BIT PUZZLED COMES BACK FOR A CLEARER INSIGHT THE CANONS ARE FALLING ONE BY ONE INCLUDING LE CELEBRE OF PACHELBEL THE FINAL MOVEMENT OF FRANCKS' SONATA FOR PIANO AND VIOLIN HOW ABOUT A NEW KIND OF HERMETIC CONSERVATISM AND SUFFERING WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS OF SAME let us GET ON WITH IT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAST BECAUSE IT ONLY BUILDS UP OUT OF FRAGMENTS EACH EVENING WE WALK OUT TO SEE HOW {they are / they were} COMING ALONG WITH THE TEMPLE THERE IS AN INTEREST IN WATCHING HOW ONE PIECE IS ADDED TO ANOTHER AT LEAST IT is not HORRIBLE LIKE BEING INSIDE A HOSPITAL AND REALLY FINDING OUT WHAT {it's / it is / it has} LIKE IN THERE SO ONE IS TEMPTED NOT TO INCLUDE THIS PAGE IN THE FRAGMENT OF OUR LIVES JUST AS {it's / it is / it has} MEANING IS ABOUT TO COAGULATE IN THE AIR AROUND {us / u. s.} FATHER SON FATHER I THOUGHT {we had / we would} LOST YOU
