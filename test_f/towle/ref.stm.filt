BRIEF MOMENTS WITH TCHAIKOVSKY YOU ARE IN FOR A RARE TREAT PETER ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY IS IN A PLAYFUL MOOD OVER HERE HE DECLARES POINTING TO THE CROISSANT SITTING ATOP WHAT APPEARS TO BE A RAISIN IS THE EXTRAORDINARY PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY WITH THE MAGNIFICENT MARC ANTOINE CHARPENTIER FAR BENEATH ITS CRUST YOU WILL HAVE TO IMAGINE THE SOUNDS OF THE BAROQUE CONCERTINO YOURSELF IF YOU WANT TO KNOW I THINK IN MY BEST MOMENTS I AM WORTHY TO NOURISH THE SAME PATCH OF GROUND OR VICE VERSA HE ADDS WITH A WINK BITING OFF AN END OF THE CROISSANT AND LEAVING CARPENTIER EXPOSED TO THE CLOSE AIR OF THE PARLOR ANY PARTICULAR BAROQUE COMPOSER I ENQUIRE WHOSE CONCERTINA i am SUPPOSED TO BE IMAGINING I did not SAY THE COMPOSER HAD TO BE BAROQUE PETER COUNTERS AIRILY ONLY THE WORK WHAT ABOUT PORCINI I HAD TO CONFESS I WAS STUMPED THE ONLY COMPOSER I KNEW BY THAT NAME WAS A LOCAL AND RATHER INEPT BUTCHER WHO SOMEWHAT RESEMBLED THE RESULTS OF HIS TRADE MY HOST WHO BY THIS TIME HAD FINISHED OFF BOTH THE PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY AND THE REMAINS OF POOR CHARPENTIER WAS LOOKING PARTICULARLY SLY WHAT INSTRUMENTS ARE USED IN THIS CONCERTINO BY PORCINI THAT YOU HAVE IN MIND I ASK CAREFULLY BUT I COULD SEE THAT I HAD WAITED TOO LONG THAT TCHAIKOVSKY HAD ENTERED THE TUNNEL OF SELF ABSORPTION AND WAS ALREADY FAR OUT OF EARSHOT I WILL ENTER THE SALON OF THE IMMORTAL SOUL HE CONTINUED TO HIMSELF FLINGING OPEN THE CLOSET WITH AN ELEGANTLY MELANCHOLY FLOURISH STARING AT THE NOT OVERLY EXPANSIVE VIEW HE MUMBLED ALOUD I WOULD NEVER HAVE TRIED TO SUPPORT MYSELF BY PLAYING THE PIANO BY SIMULTANEOUSLY READING A BOOK IN A HAMBURG BORDELLO LIKE MY CUNNINGLY CONTROVERSIAL COLLEAGUE ONCE DID IT WAS BRAHMS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW AND I KNOW WHAT WOMEN ARE LIKE TOO {they are / they were} DIFFERENT AND I do not UNDERSTAND THEM HE POINTED INDECISIVELY AT THE FURTHER WALL SEE THAT PROMONTORY OVER THERE A BEAUTIFUL SIREN USED TO SIT AND COMB HER TASTELESS MASS OF TRESSES ONCE I APPROACHED AND THE SMELL WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE BUT ALAS I WILL NEVER SEE HER SPLENDID FACE AGAIN AND THESE ARE EARLIER OBVIOUSLY NOT IN GEOLOGICAL TIME PARTICULARLY BUT HISTORICAL TIME AND THE ALLEGORICAL FIGURE OF BROOKLYN AND THE ALLEGORICAL FIGURE OF BROOKLYN IS RIGHT HERE THERE WHERE {you are / you were} STANDING AND {here's / here is / here has} HOW IT WORKS THE LAMPS GO ON AND WE WALK THROUGH MILES OF PARTS THE RAIN AND THE SLEET ARE BROUGHT ON WE TRAVEL TO QUEENS FOR TWO WEEKS OF VACATION THE SUN RETURNS AND THE GRASS AND FARMS THE VILLAGES OF BROOKLYN CONTINUE TO GROW AND THE SPACIOUS TERRACE AND OILY SAND OF BROOKLYN BREATHE ROCKED SLOWLY BY THE FIGURE AND BACK TOWARD HOME ON THE BMT WE SMILE AT THE TENDER FIGURE AND WAVE good bye NORTH THE DIRECTION NOT THE POET I did not KNOW HIM AT THE TIME THE GREEN FIGURES MOVE FORWARD AND THE OBJECTS GROW LARGER EXPLORERS OF THE SKY EXPLORING THE EARTH IMMERSED IN WATER NINETEEN SIXTEEN SEVEN WITH ITS FATAL LOOK OF ARTIFICIAL BREVITY YOUR LIFE AS IF AN ILLUSION PUTTING YOU NEAR THE WINDOW AND PROMPTLY ALL THE WINDS AND CURRENTS RUFFLE THE CURTAINS BUT THE HUMID SURROUNDINGS A TRANSPARENT LIZARD UNDER THE LEAVES AND STRETCHING ITS RUBBER LIKE PLASTIC ACROSS THE ROOM PROTRUDING WITH OUR EUROPEAN SELVES SHOW THAT WE VALIANTLY DIG AT THE EARTH POISED ON THE BRINK OF ADVENTURE OR BLISTER THE FLATULENT SKY IN OTHER WORDS YOU ARE HELD AMUSED PEACEFULLY IN THE GRASS OH BEAUTIFUL ART SPRINGING TO MIND AS WE ARE THE SUPREME JUDGES OR PERHAPS YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN AN IMPORTANT EXAGGERATED PHRASE AND YOUR WORDS SPREAD OVER THE STONES IN A PURE GROVE OF THE SPECIFIC AND YOU SPEAK ONLY THE NAMES OF THE BELLOWING ANIMALS PLANTS AND TREES WHICH BLIND YOU TOUCH SHIPS INSECTS PEOPLING THE FOREST ET CETERA THE LABYRINTH SPEAKS FROM ITS PRECIPICE ITS OUTLINE SHOOTS IN A CURVE THROUGH THE CHEMICAL AIR IN ADDITION TO WRITING THE SCRIPT OH MIRACLES OF DIVINE REACHES AND WORDS SPINNING FROM INFANCY AND WHOSE BUSINESS AND INDISPENSABLE REFERENCES ARE NOT KNOWN YOUR STORY IS TRULY A STORY TO TREASURE DISTILLED INTOXICANT THAT IT IS SAYING THAT i am A SYNONYM FOR THE RELAXED AND DRIFTING UNIVERSE A MERE SUMMARY HOLDING MY ATTENTION
