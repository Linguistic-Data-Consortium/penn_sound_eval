Hawkins-Bobbie-Louise_01_Complete-Reading_Alfred-University_10-14-75 A Subject 0.253 405.624 HE HAD A LOUSY TEMPER AND I NEVER I GUESS I NEVER WILL GET RID OF THAT SECRET SELF PROTECTION I LEARNED THEN THEY BOTH WERE FIGHTERS MY MOTHER AND FATHER I REMEMBER HIM PULLING THE TABLECLOTH OFF THE TABLE WHEN HIS BREAKFAST did not SUIT HIM WHAT A MESS AND THE TIME SHE THREW A MEAT CLEAVER AFTER HIM AND IT STUCK IN THE DOORJAMB INCHES FROM HIS HEAD HE STOPPED AND SHE SAYS HE TURNED PALE BUT HE LEFT TIME AND AGAIN HE LEFT AND WHEN HE CAME BACK {it's / it is / it has} CALLED COMING BACK HOME AFTER A FEW MONTHS OR what ever TIME {they had / they would} GET ALONG UNTIL THEY did not WE MOVED ALL OVER TEXAS NEVER MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN A PLACE USUALLY IT WAS CLOSER TO THREE OR FOUR AND THEY FOUGHT WHEREVER THEY WERE TOGETHER SO I NEVER MADE ANY FRIENDS THAT LASTED AND EVERYTHING WAS VARIOUS DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT WAS JUST MY MOTHER AND ME OR WHETHER MY FATHER WAS THERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE TRYING TO RUN A RESTAURANT TOGETHER OR WHETHER MY MOTHER WAS WORKING AS A WAITRESS DO YOU KNOW THAT BREAKFAST SHIFT DINNER SHIFT SWING SHIFT VOCABULARY OR THERE WAS A ONCE WHEN SHE WORKED IN A CANDY FACTORY COATING CHOCOLATES AND PUTTING THE IDENTIFYING LITTLE SWIRL ON TOP WHAT I REMEMBER MOST OFTEN IS THAT WE WERE JUST THE TWO OF {us / u. s.} LIVING IN A BEDROOM IN {somebody's / somebody is / somebody has} HOUSE AND MY {mother's / mother is / mother has} SALARY WOULD RUN TEN DOLLARS A WEEK AND THE ROOM PLUS BOARD FOR ME AND THE LANDLADIES LOOKING AFTER ME WOULD RUN SEVEN I do not MEAN TO MAKE THIS SOUND PATHETIC AT SOME TIME DURING THAT WHEN I WAS FIVE I STARTED SCHOOL AND I WAS A WHIZ I WENT THROUGH THE FIRST AND SECOND GRADE THE FIRST YEAR AND I WENT THROUGH THE THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE THE SECOND YEAR AND THE THIRD YEAR WHEN I WAS SEVEN I WAS IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND BROKE MY ARM TWICE SO I GOT SLOWED DOWN THAT would have BEEN WHEN WE WERE IN MINERAL WELLS MY FATHER WAS WITH {us / u. s.} THEN AND WE WERE LIVING IN A THREE ROOM HOUSE WITH A YARD AND HONEYSUCKLE ON THE PORCH AT THE BOTTOM OF A HILL {that's / that is / that has} NOTABLE FOR A LINE OF TWENTY FOOT HIGH BLOCK LETTERS FILLED WITH REGULAR LIGHT BULBS THAT IN THE NIGHT GLARED OUT WELCOME TOWARDS THE HIGHWAY I LOVED THAT SIGN IT FELT LIKE BEING IN CHURCH TO STAND AT THE BASE OF THOSE LETTERS JUST TO FINISH THAT PART OF THE STORY THE NEXT YEAR WE WENT TO NEW MEXICO AND I WENT FROM BEING A WHIZ TO PASSING THE SIXTH GRADE CONDITIONALLY I WAS A KIND OF HOUSE DUMMY THEREAFTER I do not REMEMBER WHETHER I HAD ANY NOTION OF WHAT WENT WRONG IT FEELS LIKE YEARS OF CHAOS MY FATHER FINALLY TRULY LEFT AROUND THEN WE SAT IN MY AUNT {thelma's / thelma is / thelma has} HOUSE SOUTH OF ALBUQUERQUE AND HE ROAMED IN THE NIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE YELLING NORA AND MY UNCLE EVERETT WOULD YELL BACK NORA does not WANT YOU any more AND i have GOT A TWENTY TWO HERE AND MY FATHER FINALLY LEFT FOR GOOD BUT WHILE I FEEL LIKE THAT HAS TO BE TOLD some how THESE FEW PAGES GOING THE WAY they have GONE WHAT I REALLY WANT TO MENTION AND IT TOOK ME UNTIL YESTERDAY TO GET IT INTO THE AIR IS THAT ALL THAT TIME PENNED RIGHT FROM THE FIRST READING WAS MY DARLING PLEASURE THERE WAS A RUNNING SET OF LIES THAT GOT HANDED TO ME ALL THE TIME I WAS GROWING UP WHENEVER ISSUE NUMBER ONE CAME UP ALL THE {women's / women is / women has } FACES CHANGED AND ALL THE GIRLS WERE LIED TO I realise IT WAS A CONSERVATIVE'S AND PROTECTIVE DEVICE BUT AT MY END OF IT IT ADDED UP TO A LOT OF CONFUSION FOR INSTANCE MY FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS MARKED BY MY FIRST VISIT TO A DENTIST DENTISTS ARE ON HARD TIMES IN WEST TEXAS WHERE THE WATER HAS NATURAL FLUORIDE MY {mother's / mother is / mother has} NEARING SIXTY AND HAS HAD THREE FILLINGS ALL HER LIFE LONG AND SHE GOT THOSE BECAUSE SHE MOVED AWAY FROM TEXAS ANYWAY AT THE TIME i am TALKING ABOUT WE WERE LIVING IN YORK PENNSYLVANIA TO BE NEAR MY STEPFATHER BEFORE HE WENT OFF TO WAR AND IT WAS MY FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY AND I WAS GOING TO THE DENTIST FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE BO A BOY WHO WAS MAYBE SIXTEEN WAS GOING TO COME TO THE APARTMENT LATER AND FORMALLY ASK MY PARENTS IF HE COULD TAKE ME ON MY FIRST OFFICIAL DATE THEY HAD AGREED THAT HE COULD ASK SO IT SEEMED LIKELY THE ANSWER WAS YES WHILE I WAS AT THE DENTIST'S MY MOTHER STARTED TO SHOW DUTCH THE PRESENTS I HAD GOT FROM MY FRIENDS THREE OR FOUR SMALL THINGS ONE OF WHICH WAS THE CLASSIC FIVE YEAR DIARY WHICH FELL OPEN WHEN SHE LAID IT DOWN TO WHAT I HAD IMMEDIATELY WRITTEN IN ON RECEIVING IT SO AS NOT TO FORGET THE ENTRY WAS THE WEEK BEFORE IN THE MOVIE HOUSE WITH MY FRIENDS I HAD KISSED THE BOY WHO WAS DUE TO ARRIVE AROUND FOUR THIS AFTERNOON IT WAS THERE IN BLACK AND WHITE WITH ECSTATIC EXCLAMATION MARKS THAT ENTRY PROVED TO BE THE FIRST AND LAST OF THAT POSSIBILITY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DAYS DOWN THE DRAIN PRECLUDED BY STUPIDITY I HAD TAKEN THE ABSTRACTION OF MY DIARY AS AN ALLOWANCE PROOF AGAINST GETTING HOISTED ON THE HOOK BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT DOWN THE POWER OF A DEFINED OCCASION AND I LEARNED THE WAY IT REALLY WAS WHEN I GOT BACK FROM THE DENTIST AND FACED THOSE TWO FACES ME THE BIRTHDAY GIRL AND THEM THE TRIBUNAL THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT I HAD MADE A MISTAKE MY MOTHER TOOK ME INTO THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO ME KISSING IN THE MOVIES IS VULGAR BUT WORSE THAN THAT AND SHE RANG THE SHIFT ON ME NO GIRL SHOULD KISS A BOY UNTIL {they are / they were} ENGAGED I could not BELIEVE IT THAT SHE WAS SAYING THAT I LOOKED AT HER AND SHE LOOKED AS SOLEMNLY BACK AS IF SHE MEANT TO STAND BY THAT STATEMENT AGAINST COME WHAT MAY I JUST LOST MY PLACE I could not BELIEVE IT I MEAN SHE CAME OFF A FARM AND WHEN AUNT MYRTLE'S BABY CAME SEVEN MONTHS AFTER SHE WAS MARRIED
