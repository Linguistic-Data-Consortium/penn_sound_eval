novel entitled The Bat which would've faded entirely into obscurity if Bob Kane hadn't watched the movie version of the book and invented his response character Batman  I've gone through Mary Reinhold Roberts original novel The Bat and excerpted every sentence that included the words the editor  and created a new piece The Editor A Detective Story A city editor at lunch with a colleague pulled at his cigarette and talked Oh for  lay off it will you said the city editor peevishly The editor spread out his hands The editor frowned The editor was emphatic The editor laughed grimly The editor smiled His companion rose as well but it was evident that the editor's theory had taken firm hold on his mind The editor paused in the doorway Well said the editor you won't let it go any further Tall

books painted those co  tho those comic book frames in monumental scale and often would have uh thought balloons and speech bubbles embedded in these paintings The strange thing is is that now he has an extremely litigious estate who has actually sought after anyone who uses the same frames he used and has issued cease and desist orders for plagiarism This is my attempt to steal back my comic book collection from Roy Lichtenstein And consists of all of the text used in all of his paintings in the order by which they were pai  in which they were painted It's entitled I Can See the Whole Room And There's Nobody In It One Look Mickey I've hooked a big one Tweet It's it's not an engagement ring is it I can see the whole room and there's nobody in it Am  I'm supposed to report to a Mister Bellamy I wonder what he's like Knock knock Toot Ring Vip Zing I tried to reason it out I tried to see thing from Mom and Dad's viewpoint I try not to think of Eddie so my mind would be clear and common sense could take over but Eddie kept coming back I have something for you to eat in the kitchen dear I'm not hungry mother Please I want to go to my room Forget it Forget me I'm fed up with your kind Why Brad darling this painting is a masterpiece Why soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work Ruff Flatten sand fleas Thung The exhausted soldiers sleepless for four and five and six days at a time always hungry for decent chow suffering from the tropical fungus infections kept fighting Takka Takka As I c  s  i  as I started clipping a MIG's tail this hot shot jet outfit I'm in will treat me like a vet pilot when I return from my number one wingding with a report of target destroyed Bratatat That was their mistake because it gave me more targets than I could shoot at Number four One more to make ace Brattata Tex Blam Take cover Live ammo Right now if they're watching me they've got to make up their minds whether I don't know they're here and will pass by letting the outfit be sucked into a trap or whether I do know they're here and am about to fire at them But where did they come from
