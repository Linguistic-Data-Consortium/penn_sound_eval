money on the next pitch at eight to five turning suddenly and raising the hands to grab the home run ball still warm from the pitcher's hand and turning as fluidly to collect his bet adjusting his cap It's very distinct at the ballpark the players play ball the umpires arbitrate the groundskeepers manicure the grounds watering the base paths with grave silk like movements They're all regally ignorant of the spectators watching among other things  their actions their efforts their cheers their jeers fall on deaf ears The young Dominican pitcher surveys his outfield vibrant green under the lights Este es mi parque The cheers of the patron rain  the cheers of the patrons rain down on his deaf ears At the ball park it's all very distinct  This one is called Vision of Childhood The rain tonight on the mountain outside my window on the street on the freeways of California on the farms in the Livermore Valley raining tonight in Placerville where my wife's father was born The black water on the mountain here five hundred yards beyond my window The water cutting its own sluices in the soil of California I forget what I was talking to him about in the dream my son the age of three about the people who'd come to California in the past in forty nine They sailed in wooden ships around the horn or walked beside their oxen across the Sierras all that energy spent Some vision some getting whether it was the gold that got them here or the soil or even the weather which even today the magazines extoll Our Soon to Be Biggest State The governor in his press releases his census estimates the streamings over the borders of California the several chambers of commerce a perfect environment for all ages from the cradle to the grave And he said But I didn't come around the horn His mother an advertising copywriter whom I divorced had just returned with him from New York I came through the canal Why of course It seemed in the dream obvious to me knowing the anatomy of America Someone was ironing a work shirt for me in the hallway outside that room And then the letter from his mother He was sitting at breakfast playing with ten bright shiny new pennies all lined up in a row all the Lincoln heads up all looking the same way He straightened up looked all the Lincolns in the eye and said Okay you guys Smile This one is uh  yeah I hope he's not here This one is a  is about a barber that I used to go to had my hair cut uh pretty regularly uh on uh on the bottom end of Columbus Avenue And it's called The Fortunate Barber The fortunate barber hones his razor He says he remembers back to Prohibition Elder the barber tells about the horrors Oh those corpses those Barbary Coast days At his age his white hair the red bangs of his face sex and liquor seemed to be his main concerns This friend of mine's window faced the hospital these two nurses giving it to ea to each other with a rubber cock Sex and liquor fill his talk his Sundays with his married daughter in Walnut Creek her kids Beatniks queers foreign cars those track stars Willie Mays they're all Black those fucking shines The red cheeks of his granddaughter his Irish week his nights in front of the TV His wife wakes him when he falls asleep and they turn off the set and go to bed Almost every time there's someone I cut his hair last week Next thing I hear he took a heart attack One brother's dead an alcoholic who fell down once and bled all over Elmer's car Barber's eyes that day A second brother's hassled with the V A I saw that one shuffle out of a place one afternoon The fortunate barber reads the newspaper He stands in his doorway He watches me go by The back of my neck the hair around my ears from day to day The travel agent next door's another customer and most of the cops back and forth from Central Station We walk by the shops throughout the week and he looks at the backs of our necks and our ears out there abroad in the May streets  This one's called Flowers because they've come to be Late blooming marigolds nasturtiums daisies yawning on a Sunday morning in the sunlight hits October We woke up this morning and they started putting the world together The sunlight on the wall in your hair your eyes blinking the air outside my window Nasturtiums chrysanthemums late blooming marigold daisies yawning on a Sunday morning You've entered this poem You're leaning against the doorjamb You've taken off your shoes The abstractions fall away like shoes lying there by the door to my kitchen You walk over to the window where I'm looking down at the house across the street the colors of their roofs Late blooming marigolds daisies yawning on a Sunday morning in the sunlight the rooftop the tar flower the shingled bloom the tile burgeoning It's October We woke up this morning and they started putting the world together that fog to the north hiding what hasn't been made yet  By this afternoon aquatic cartwheel has been created
