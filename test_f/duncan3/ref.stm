Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81 A Speaker1 0.151 517.28 x seem preposterous some of it but so I underl un beneath this there seems to be such a period of Emily's Luckily  in which he emerges even freer than the x whereas people do go through that period uh x I'm thinking about early structures that you actually go through that you can call upon x you know x after all you've got a x different kind of poetry x Mhm x certainly Pound did not go through some such structure because he just dismisses like an eighteenth century rationalist Well that ends up with no atheism no god nothing like as if nobody's talking about it x so he's just across from it x It's not accessible yet at a very later stage he wants to take up the subject The same happens with the economics with e Emily's x here her intuitions are contemporaneous with Marx's I mean in Marx's case a whole politics and a whole economics is being built x but the underlying intuitions the underlying feeling that it permeates all life x which is different from x is is the x  that something permeates every level of your consciousness is not reductive and and and and and that it it Right and to say that it's the real thing is so so x Mhm It is i i it becomes more and more amazing as you read her that she does have all   h her sensibility is so related to that of people working in at the same time but in other places that she couldn't possibly have read specifically x I I was amazed for example with x lines in her work They're identical with lines in Christina Rossetti and Ah yes I would check the  I checked the first time her  Christina Rossetti's poems were published and they weren't published until nineteen sixty two and a lot of the lines that are identi  I mean eighteen sixty two x she's got no reference Christina Rossetti x and there's there's no possible reference in x absolute identical lines And she did have Emily Bronte's poetry she had the Brontes' poetry and and that's one of the  that's the book she sends to the publisher and he's he's overawed and sends it back to her because it was a first edition Yeah Yeah Mhm Even then rare and much sought after uh but x this is the kind of thing where you do we x  we need to x scholar just to find x  to find the manuscript when we all look at the lines to find out how could she possibly write a Christina Rossetti poem Mhm x there was this uh amazing x nucleus of wo women that were born all  almost a identical time there was Susan Gilbert and they were born five days or something like that or a week apart or something like that and then Helen Hunt Jackson was born a month before and there's only four days actually between her and and Christina Rossetti and x born x x exactly the same time And and we can s  turn around and say that the American household at the Amherst College level and the Rossetti h household Oh they're almost identical They're that x  that close that we haven't got a separation in in in in the social but we can Yeah when we go to the Dickinsons we realize that that that what has disappeared in America is this English household that the Dickinsons Amherst's was in English through and through and through And so it was going to be just like England not not not  it's hard to pose that she were even x say that that your family were continually marrying and and and and English just by race but but the American family is not English through and through and nor is the English family x Yeah Yeah Another little poem that I'll just x read a x a short quote from uh in the same kind of sense of counting in the material world and contrasting it with another kind of infinity is poem sixty three which includes the line it springs from winter's rise can the anemones be reckoned up  Mhm And can is in italics here x italics Going on to one to Sue That was an italicized one to Sue No it wasn't uh x was That as it is in there The two that are italicized  yeah okay x What x Oh I was just saying that this is a a a a place where that Can't be counted up Yep  the  the two kinds of infinity are brought together and and and Mhm uh put into a relationship and she x infinity is is is diffuse but when it's the impalpable it means it's numbers Mhm And numbers are not diffuse at all It means that numbers extend Remember the other picture we have is that there's a limit x and at the limit we're at the point of diffusion but it but it  but the  the factory is x  they called it the sea by the way Mhm But the sea here was that there was was a sea of the finite that the finite was infinite that the particular was i infinite That's what they faced numbers which were were x but just there went all way up and and became a sea and undid the mind but they called it And Emily is amazing because she's always facing both of them Mhm Without flinching really And then she she loves the the numberless and is ready to to look at  ready to look at each robin and each anemone in someone Also immediate to it one of the one of the debilities of our period let's say a x head or mind for instance we x preSocratics or or I'm still amazed a and yet that's okay that's my disposition I I've got the x why x Heidegger so forth and so on fill my head full of them None of this makes my whole experience of this Emily keeps  Em  in Emily's library we do not find the preSocratics right around the corner We don't and so forth so that many of these things we experienced as initial they're initial in me by the way I x I don't read Heidegger because it's Heidegger I read Heidegger because I recognize but meanwhile I have so complicated the picture that I've almost lost the immediacy of of  the great thing going to that manuscript is x immediacies regardless of my theory but that's  that has to be taken back for us from Heidegger In in Emily's case some of the most Mhm rich parts of her x  I'm trying to think of x the guy is is is I K  but what is his second name The one  one of her major texts she draws on x I k x x M m m m marvel x Marvel right Now when when I got to that text I I'm going to start x because that  those texts underlie her more surely than Emerson does x marvel right In other words she had find  found a mind that was remarkably close but wh wh what  at the very beginning fifteen years ago when people started writing on my poetry and x was doing his thesis he never x  he might have gotten tenure without a thesis but he kept sending me passages of x and I began to realize no wonder I don't want to read x because it sounded like x he was also reading my x journal It sounded just like my x journals I wrote back Well x and I are not that different in age and we all draw on x and the gestalt in addition to whatever other psychologies x and and and and that is what underlies it     So that no wonder x but als also temperament underlies it because x so many people who x gestalt don't end up sounding like x and and and and Duncan and and and there were not that many passages  x comes from certain gestalt  ideas Nowhere sounds like it Well there can be that and and Emily was in this kind of redundancy in which she was robbed of the x  of the immediacy In this realm of the  of of that of that particular x Whitman who was Mhm embracing Hegel and everything is robbed of enormous areas of immediacy so he has big nonimmediate ideas and then x so do I Emily's x  she's got and a lot of hers I think one could go back to that text the marvel that she's always going back and say okay these areas are almost certain to be now no wonder they're diffuse what's remarkable is she'll find the infinite where it's not diffuse Mhm Mhm Mhm Because marvel's not about the x
