Garrison-Deborah-and-Komunyakaa-Yusef_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-22-99 A Subject 0.174 425.532 i am A WINDOW { he's / he was / he is / he has} LOST HIS RIGHT ARM INSIDE THE STONE IN THE BLACK MIRROR A {woman's / woman is / woman has} TRYING TO ERASE NAMES NO { she's / she was / she is / she has} BRUSHING A {boy's / boy is / boy has} HAIR I SHOULD SAY THAT IT TOOK ME FOURTEEN YEARS TO WRITE ABOUT THE viet nam EXPERIENCE AND AT THE TIME I WAS RENOVATING A HOUSE IN NEW ORLEANS AND THAT PRETTY MUCH PROMPTED THE MOMENT TO WRITE ABOUT viet nam I HAD VERY SYSTEMATICALLY WRITTEN AROUND THAT EXPERIENCE WELL {here's / here is / here has} A POEM ABOUT {that's / that is / that has} A BIT MORE PERSONAL {it's / it is / it has} ABOUT SOMETHING i have ACTUALLY HAD QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE WRITING ABOUT WHICH IS THE DEATH OF MY FATHER WHO PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND AS ANYONE KNOWS WHO HAS LOST A PARENT AND CERTAINLY LOST A PARENT AT A BIT OF A YOUNGER AGE THERE IS THIS I IN A WAY OF COURSE {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} AN INCREDIBLE TRAGEDY BUT {there's / there is / there has} THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT COME WITH IT AND I GUESS AS I GREW OLDER I FELT A STRANGE SENSE OF ALMOST SPECIALNESS FOR HAVING SORT OF SURVIVED THIS THING I IN IN MY teen age YEARS AND I OFTEN HAVE REFLECTED ON IT AS i have GROWN OLDER THAT ONE FEELS THE SADNESS AND THE GUILT BUT ANOTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS THE SENSE OF HAVING BEEN SINGLED OUT AND HAVING BEEN MADE SPECIAL BY HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE AND I TRIED TO CAPTURE THAT I do not KNOW IF I HAVE BUT THIS POEM IS CALLED SHE THINKS OF HIM ON HER BIRTHDAY {it's / it is / it has} STILL WINTER AND STILL I do not KNOW YOU any more AND YOU do not KNOW ME BUT THIS MORNING I STAND IN THE KITCHEN WITH THE ILLUSION PEELING A CLEMENTINE EACH PIECE SNAPS LIKE THE NICKNAME FOR A GIRL THE TINNY BITE IT WAS TO BE ONE ONCE AGAIN I COUNT YOUR DAUGHTERS AND FIND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE THE WAIST OF THE HOURGLASS ENDLESSLY PASSED THROUGH AND PASSED THROUGH BUT HOLDING NOTHING DISMAYED BY THE GRUBBY FEBRUARY SUN I WAS BORN UNDER AND THE CHEAP PLEASURE IT GIVES THE WINDOW YET I RAISE THE SHADE FOR IT AND TRY NOT TO FEEL IT IS WRONG TO WANT SPRING TO BE A SEASON FURTHER FROM YOU NOT WRONG TO WISH FOR A HARD RAIN A HARD WIND LIKE ONE WE SAT OUT IN TOGETHER OR CAME IN FROM TOGETHER {here's / here is / here has} A POEM ABOUT A SITUATION WHICH I IS PROBABLY FAMILIAR TO MANY WORKING PEOPLE AND THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY ABOUT WORKING WOMEN AND THE WAY THAT WE DRAG OURSELVES THROUGH THE DAY AT TIMES some timeS INSPIRED some timeS EXHAUSTED AND I THINK THERE IS A PARTICULAR SADNESS OF A WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE WHEN SHE BEGINS TO realise WHAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} BEEN DOING WITH HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HOPING FOR SOMETHING MORE WORKS LATE ON A TUESDAY NIGHT AGAIN mid town IS BLASTED OUT AND SILENT DRAINED OF THE CROWD AND ITS DOGGY DAY I TRAMPLE THE SCRAPS OF DELI LUNCHES SOME ATE OUTDOORS AS THEY STARED DUMBLY OR HOOTED AT {us / u. s.} CAREER GIRLS THE HAGGARD BEAUTIES THE VIVID CAN DOS OPEN RAINCOATS A FLAP IN THE MARCH WIND AS WE CROSSED TO AND FRO IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY NEVER THOUGHT {you had / you would} BE ONE OF THEM DID YOU LITTLE LADY LITTLE MISS PHI BETA KAPPA WITH YOUR CLOSET FULL OF PLEATED SKIRTS TWENTY NINE TIL DEATH DO {us / u. s.} PART do not YOU SEE THE GOOD SCHOOLGIRL TURNS THIRTY FORTY SINGING THE SONG OF TIME MANAGEMENT ALL DAY LONG LUGGING THE BRIEFCASE HOME SO AT TEN PM {you are / you were} STANDING HERE WITH YOUR HAND IN THE AIR COLD BUT TOO STUBBORN TO REACH INTO YOUR POCKET FOR A GLOVE CURSING THE FREEZING RAIN AS THOUGH IT WERE YOUR DIFFICULTY {it's / it is / it has} PATHETIC AND {nobody's / nobody is / nobody has} FAULT BUT YOUR OWN NOW THE TEARS DOWN INTO THE COLLAR CABS CABS BUT NONE FOR HIRE I have not HAD DINNER i am NOT HALF OF WHAT i am MEANT TO BE AMONG OTHER THINGS THE MOTHER OF THREE TOO TIRED TONIGHT TO SEDUCE THE FATHER THE NEXT POEM i am GOING TO READ IS A POEM ENTITLED THE DECK AND AND I THINK THE POEM SORT OF EMBRACES THAT MOMENT WHEN I realise SOMETHING THAT TAUGHT ME A GREAT DEAL THE DECK I HAVE ALMOST NAILED MY LEFT THUMB TO THE TWO BY FOUR BRACE THAT HOLDS THE DECK TOGETHER THE SATURDAY MORNING IN JUNE i have SAWED TWO BY SIXES T SQUARED LEATHERED EVERYTHING THE THREE BUBBLES SEAL IN GREEN GLASS AND ON THE SWEAT ON MY TONGUE TASTE IS LIKE WHAT I AM I KNOW i am ALONE USING LEVERAGE TO SWING THE LONG BOARDS INTO PLACE BUT AT TIMES IT SEEMS AS IF THERE ARE TWO OF {us / u. s.} WORKING SIDE BY SIDE LIKE OLD LOVERS GUESSING EACH OTHERS MOVES THIS HAMMER IS THE ONLY THING I OWNED OF YOURS AND IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF i have CARPENTERED FOR YEARS EVEN THE CROOKED NAILS HAVE GONE IN STRAIGHT THE HANDSAW GLIDES THROUGH GREASE THE TOENAIL STUDS HOLE THE DECK HAS RISEN UP AROUND ME AND NOW {it's / it is / it has} STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT MY WEIGHT TO NOT SWAY WITH THIS OLD SILLY WRONG FOOTED DANCE i am ABOUT TO THROW MY WHOLE BODY INTO PLUMBED FROM SKY TO GROUND THIS {morning's / morning is / morning has} WORK CAN TAKE NEARLY ANYTHING WITH SO MUCH UPROAR PUNISHMENT FOOTWORK AND EUPHORIA i am ALMOST HAPPY THIS SATURDAY I WALK BACK INSIDE AND HERE YOU ARE PLANED AND SIMPLE AS AS THE SUNLIGHT ON THE TOOLS OUTSIDE DADDY IF {you had / you would} COME BACK A WEEK AGO A DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I would have BEEN READY TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A LONG TALK WITH YOU THERE WERE THINGS I WANTED TO SAY SO MANY QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK BUT they have BEEN ANSWERED WITH AS MUCH SALT AND TRUTH AS WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE LIVING {i had / i would} LIKE TO READ A POEM CALLED AN IDLE THOUGHT WHICH IS THE KIND OF DAYDREAM OF A WOMAN {who's / who is / who has} MARRIED AT TWENTY ONE WHICH I WAS AND OCCASIONALLY HER HER MIND WANDERS OFF TO OTHER PASSIONS SHE MAY HAVE KNOWN AND {i had / i would} LIKE TO PREFACE THIS BY SAYING THAT THE POEM WAS WRITTEN WELL BEFORE MONICA LEWINSKY EVER APPEARED ON THE SCENE SO i am NOW some timeS EMBARRASSED BY IT BECAUSE IT IT CONTAINS A FANTASY OF SEDUCING THE PRESIDENT WHICH HAS IN OUR COUNTRY THIS THAT SUBJECT HAS PLAYED OUT IN A VERY SILLY WAY BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS A BRITISH CHARACTER WHO LISTENERS HERE MAY KNOW SO I do not KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THIS PERSON IS IS OF SOME SEX APPEAL AN IDLE THOUGHT i am NEVER GOING TO SLEEP WITH MARTIN AMIS OR ANYONE FAMOUS AT TWENTY ONE I SCOTCHED MY CHANCE TO BE ONE OF THE SEDUCTRESSES OF THE CENTURY A VAMP ON THE RISE THROUGH THE RANKS OF LITERARY GODS AND MILITARY MEN WHO would not STOP AT THE PRESIDENT {she had / she would} TAKE THE PENTAGON BY STORM IN HALTER DRESS AND RHINESTONE EXTRAS LETTING FLY THE BREASTS THAT SHATTER CRYSTAL THEN DUMP HIM TOO AND BREAK HIS POWER BROKER HEART SUCH WOMEN ARE A BREED APART
