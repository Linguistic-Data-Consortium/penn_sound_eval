CERTAINLY AND I SAID OH I SEE { he's / he was / he is / he has} JUST TALKING YES THIS POETRY'S NO DIFFERENT FROM SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TALKING FOR REAL AND THE REASON I had not BEEN ABLE TO READ HIM IS THAT MY {father's / father is / father has} POETRY AND ALL THE POETRY {i had / i would} EVER READ WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEBODY TALKING NOT FOR REAL OR A DIFFERENT STYLE THAN REAL CONVERSATION {it's / it is / it has} LIKE IF HE READS A SONNET OR {it's / it is / it has} A LITERARY SOUND OR {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A PUN OR ON SOMEBODY {else's / else is / else has} POEM OR IT HAS SOME STALE WASH OF ANOTHER POEM OVER IT BUT THIS WAS JUST ABSOLUTE STRAIGHTFORWARD WELL CONVERSATION I GUESS OR DECLARATION OR SPEECH BUT THE POETRY WAS IDENTICAL WITH INTENSE FRAGMENTS OF SPOKEN IDIOM AS YOU MIGHT HEAR AT MARSEILLE HIMSELF AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME {i had / i would} EVER HEARD OF SUCH A NOTION THAT THE POETRY COULD BE REAL OR THAT REALIT THAT IT COULD BE SOMEBODY TALKING FOR REAL INSTEAD OF MAKING UP A POEM LIKE OR MAKING UP MAKING IT UP TO LOOK GOOD AND I do not KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT I COULD I do not KNOW HOW IF I COULD EVEN YOU KNOW DESCRIBE WHAT MY IDEA OF POETRY WAS BEFORE I SAID I WAS SUPPOSED IT I did not BECAUSE I JUST NEVER THOUGHT IT OUT BUT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT COULD BE IDENTICAL WITH ACTUAL SPEECH AND ONCE I UNDERSTOOD THAT THEN I COULD START READING THEM AND I BEGAN READING IT AND AND THAT REALLY BLEW MY MIND THEN AFTER THAT HE I THINK WAS HE READ let us SEE PURE PRODUCTS OF AMERICA GO CRAZY AND THAT WAS VERY MOVING YEAH BECAUSE I FIN FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS NIFTY I THOUGHT THAT I COULD PUT THE ACCENT IN THIS OTHER STYLE AND WE DEGRADED PER HIS DESTINY ABOUT HOW HUNGER CAN FEED ITSELF AND THEN THE INTERESTING THING WAS WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE AN IMAGINATION OF HEAVEN OR WHAT HE DESIRED IT WAS A REAL DOWN TO EARTH {it's / it is / it has} A VERY COMMON WHILE HE WHILE THE IMAGINATION IS STRANGE ENOUGH THAT IT FEELS OVERWROUGHT AND STIFLING AND SOME KIND STRANGE WITH DEER GOING EVERYTHING IS STRANGE AFTER DEER GOING BY AND FIELDS WERE STUCK WITH THIS THIS GOLDENROD AND THE STIFLING STIFLING HE WOULD some timeS some how IT SEEMS TO HIS STRIDE YEAH NO ONE TO WITNESS AND ADJUST NO ONE TO DRIVE A CAR WITNESS AND ADJUST {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT SO NOW ONCE I ONCE I GOT THE IDEA THAT HE WAS TALKING FOR REAL AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS THAT WE GOT TO EAT SHIT I MEAN W WHAT HE WAS SAYING THAT THE WAY WE ARE LIVING {it's / it is / it has} LIKE {we are / we were} EATING SHIT INSTEAD OF YEAH INSTEAD OF OUR DESIRE TO SEEM {that's / that is / that has} TO THE HUNGER TOO YEAH NOTES THAT SEEMS REALLY RADICAL TO ME AND AMAZING THAT ANYBODY WOULD BE SAYING ANYTHING SO INTERIOR AND FRANK AND REALISTIC JUST LIKE {you had / you would} THINK TO YOURSELF WHEN {you are / you were} ALONE IN BED AT NIGHT AND some how THAT TURNED THAT CHANGED IT TURNED ME AROUND COMPLETELY AS FAR AS WHAT POETRY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BECAUSE BEFORE THAT {i had / i would} BEEN WRITING RHYMED VERSE IMITATING SIR THOMAS WYATT THAT POET I ASSUME {that's / that is / that has} SENSING YOUR OFFICE CALVES AND THOSE {it's / it is / it has} NOT SIMPLY A DEPRESSED STATE OF MIND BUT {it's / it is / it has} A SENSE THAT THE THAT THE RESOURCES OF THE TERMINATIONS OF THE COMMON WORLD THE HAVE REALLY BEEN DIS DISAPPOINTING TO PUT IT MILDLY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY USED TO NOTHING MORE THAN HOPE TO USE TO TO TO TO EITHER ACT TO TO TO TO TO RE TO FACT AND OR HOPE might have MIGHT might have PROVEN THE CASE CHRIS WEETABIX HAS BEEN TALKING THE GROUP OF NOT THAT IF A YOUNGER A BIT OF UNDERGRADUATE CLASS REHEARSING THE THE POLITICAL EVENTS OF THE LAST OF YESTERDAY PARTICULARLY AND THEN DISPOSITION FOR EXAMPLE ALAN HAD A PIECE FROM THE BOSTON GLOBE WHICH HAS BEEN DOING A AN INTENSIVE INVESTIGATORY BUSINESS ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION OF THE FBI AND THE FBI HAD HAD OBVIOUSLY BEE HAD PULLED BACK FROM USING ITS OWN PEOPLE AND COVERED ILLEGAL INFORMATION THIS IS IT AND APPARENTLY {it's / it is / it has} GOT A WHOLE SORT OF ALMOST ONE WANTS TO SAY A SUBCULTURE OF EAGER BEAVERS AND VOLUNTARY PEOPLE VIGILANTE YEAH YEAH VIGILANTE GROUPS THAT ARE PRACTICALLY DOING THE SAME INVESTIGATIONS AFOREMENTIONED ALL ALL ILLEGAL BUT NOT CONSTITUTING YOU KNOW FEDERAL DEVELOPMENTS OF COMMON AGENCY FUNNY ANYHOW {we are / we were} TALKING ABOUT THIS BOOK AND THIS i am TALKING ABOUT THE SANDINISTAS AND COULD ONE THINK OF IT AS SIMPLY GOOD GUYS VERSUS BAD GUYS AND ALAN HAD SEEN THEM REPEATING IN THE S IN THE ON THE B THE BATHROOM JUST MOMENTS AGO THAT SAID IF YOU IF YOU LIKE CUBA you will REALLY LOVE NICARAGUA SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WOULD THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WERE WERE SIMPLY SWEETNESS AND LIGHT JUST YEAH BUT IN FACT IT IS A VERY YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A VERY ONE ONE PARTY GOVERNMENT WITH VERY DETERMINED ATTITUDES AND AND VERY REAL SENSES OF OF SOCIAL CONDUCT BEING YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THE PRO OR CON OR AGAINST IT SO THAT THE VERY WITH YOU OR AGAINST YOU IS THEIR THINKING YEAH REALLY REALLY VERY DETERMINING OF CERTAIN CONFLICTS INSTEAD OF A SORT OF NOW THAT I THINK OTHER THINKING OF THE ISRAELI COLLEGE STANDING IN BUSINESS BUT I WAS THINKING {it's / it is / it has} BLEAK INDEED THESE DAYS IT WAS OBVIOUSLY BLEAK IN WILLIAMS'S TIME EQUALLY TO THINK OF WHAT YOU COULD PROPOSE AS A VIABLE AND CONSEQUENT WORLD FOR THESE IMAGINATIONS AND OR THE PRACTICAL VIOLENCE UP AND BEYOND TWO HUNDRED WORDS FOREVER I FELT THAT ENDING ONE TIME {i had / i would} FALLEN FOR THAT WITH TWO VISITS THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT A BETTER PLACE JUST FELT IT YEAH I FELT IT I FELT THE NEED FOR THE ME AND HIS FEARS OF NOTHING THAT WHAT HE SAID REALLY FUCK THINGS UP HE did not USE THAT EXPRESSION BUT THAT WAS THE %bcack YEAH THAT WAS MID FIFTIES THAT WAS THAT WAS THE MID FIFTIES X WELL {he had / he would} BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO COMMUNISM A LITTLE {i had / i would} BET YEAH WELL let us THINK OF IT IN GREEN BRUSHER i am THINKING YEAH GOOD YOU WANT TO BE MARRIED YOUR MARRIAGE YEAH OR TO PAINT CHURCH AS A PUNISHMENT YEAH WHEN { she's / she
