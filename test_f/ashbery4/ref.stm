reflection of a pin on an apple The shadow of a pin on an apple  um That's uh  that got me  interested Yeah and but yeah then Wh what set you to translate him I mean was it  I know there was some of your translations in Evergreen Review about nineteen sixty two or something like that Yeah Was that on the occasion of  Reverdy died in nineteen sixty didn't he and Sixty yep Yeah did that occasion those translations or I don't remember it was uh  but the x du France was interested in uh uh  I used to know the an editor there Maurice x and um I remember discussing with him how poets in New York namely Kenneth Koch and Frank O'Hara were very very uh enamored of of uh of Reverdy and he uh he was very interested in this and asked us to uh to write something about him for the x du France which I believe I did Frank I think did um and um Did the translations though come about at that same time or had you done a number of them for the anthology earlier Oh um Yeah that was around the same time I I f I f I forget exactly why I sent them to Evergreen Review which took forever to publish them and and I heard didn't really want to Really Well somebody said that they had been in the office at Evergreen and m my uh Reverdy translations had been spiked as they say in offices x with other papers file and forget and somebody had written boring on them   And it it was several years bef  after they accepted them that they published them but at that time they were you know x publishing mainly beat literature which would be to the um opposite pole from Reverdy Yeah And how about the the work of Max Jacob how did you get interested in that  um I  I don't remember I think probably  it was Kenneth who x blessings  x whose  who introduced me but I really can't remember whose x so long ago I think I  I can't remember a time when I didn't uh read his his work Was it particularly the cornet a des that x you Yeah Yeah mhm Yeah And the one about the th  colony in Brazil do you remember what th  what the title of that is In the cornet a des Yeah no now no  another poem of x x I don't know um Anyway I remember the one about x a wonderful poem of his uh Yes um And uh while you were living in France you'd actually stayed in France uh it was mentioned how you had done some work to supplement your income you'd done some translation work I remember seeing a book I can't remember the author now but it was a book on Melville by a French writer and it was published by Grove Press here in your translation Is that x am I right about that Yeah Was that assigned to you and It was assigned by Grove Press and um um I didn't particularly like the book so I won't reveal the author's name he was a professor at the Sorbonne In fact I can't remember his name at the moment I I could probably but um Grove offered me I think a hundred and fifty dollars to translate this book which uh was wonderful if you didn't have any money and um  so I made an appointment to see the the author and hoping that he would give me his notes especially the uh sources of all the quotations from Melville that were in the book and he said Oh I don't keep any notes I said Well how am I  I can't translate Melville into my own English   um So I ended up having to buy all of Melville's books  in  which weren't that easy to find some of them in Paris at that time and then flipping through them desperately searching for x half of a sentence   It was terrible Sounds like you lost money on the deal I x  And you did a number of sort of police novel crime novels as well  uh Two yes Oh um That was for Edition x You ever hear of them That was  x No x A guy named Frederic x who was  they published mainly trash and um the um  one of them was called um x I forget how it  what the word was but I I translated it the deadlier sex which was about women of course and I think that's the title that was chosen and the other one was  that was by a w  a woman writer named Genevieve x who I'm sure is a name that won't ring any bells either And the other one was by a writer named Noel Vexin V E X I N it's called Champagne obligitoire  and um it's  it was about um gangster run nightclubs in Montmartre and in those places where i i if you were so unlucky as to go into one you were forced to buy champagne and it was  oh it was terrible champagne but on the menu would read champagne obligitoire and so I I um uh I translated it compulsory champagne which I thought was a nice title but they changed that at Dell to um Murder in Montmartre  and uh  but uh  and a actually I think I got about a hundred and fifty dollars for each of those and I never knew whether they were published or not For some reason my contact x x she was a friend who  a French friend who then moved to New York and I lost touch with  him and um um so when my friend David x was compiling a bibliography of me a a number of years ago
