Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A Unknown1 0.098 487.866 I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT FOR LAURA SMITH ABOUT HER TALK AND {it's / it is / it has} A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT JOHN RETALACK SAID ABOUT THE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH RUPTURE RAPTURE OR THE TROUBLING NATURE OF FUSING THOSE TWO WHEN {you are / you were} LOOKING AND THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODIES THE VIOLENT STUDIES OF BODIES THE HISTORY OF BODIES IN RELATIONSHIP TO ONE ANOTHER PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU WERE DOING YOUR PIECE ON MICHAELA OLIVER AND SINCE { she's / she was / she is / she has} SPECIFICALLY INVOKING THE ISSUE OF OF NOT JUST THE ISSUE OF SLAVERY BUT THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE DONE TO BODIES THROUGH SLAVERY I do not KNOW YOU KNOW SAIDIYA HARTMAN SCENES OF SUBJECTION IN WHICH SHE TALKS ABOUT KIND OF %bcack THE NOT JUST THE KIND OF RUPTURE IN RELATIONSHIP TO BODIES BUT THE PLEASURE BRANDED IN THE IN THE IN VAR THE DANGEROUS FORMS OF PLEASURE AND i am WONDERING IF YOU COULD %bcack RIGHT THERE SPEAK TO HOW OBVIOUSLY YOU could not DO THAT IN A VERY SHORT PRESENTATION BUT HOW BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS PART OF YOUR WORK ON A LARGER PROJECT HOW DOES YOUR WORK DEAL WITH WHEN YOU PUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER IN CONVERSATION HOW DOES IT DEAL WITH THOSE WITH THE TROUBLING DIMENSIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT ABANDONING YOUR INTEREST IN EXPLORING OLIVER'S WORK IN THIS WAY I MEAN I I I THINK THAT MY ANSWER TO THAT AND AND MY RESPONSE TO THE THE LINK BETWEEN RUPTURE AND i am SORRY RAPTURE AND ITS RELIGIOUS CONNOTATIONS ARE ARE ARE THE SAME AND AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT i am SO INTERESTED IN IN WHAT I SEE AS OLIVER'S REPURPOSING OF THE IDEA OF RAPTURE IT SO EMBODIED IN HER VERSION AND I AND I THINK IT SECULARIZED AND I AND I S I SEE THIS I i have BEEN SEEING THIS ACROSS SUCH A LOT OF QUEER AND TRANS WORK %bcack THAT i am SEEING THESE VER VERY RADICAL TRENDS BODILY IDENTIFICATIONS THAT ARE VARYINGLY LOCATED VERY RACED VERY GENDERED VERY SPECIFIC VERY AWARE OF BOUNDARIES WHILE THEY TRANSGRESS AND AND I AND {that's / that is / that has} INTENSELY PARADOXICAL BUT I THINK THAT AND AND I AND I I DO THINK THAT {there's / there is / there has} THIS CRUX ABOUT TRANS ILLNESS THAT THAT WORK IS THINKING ABOUT AND THINKING ABOUT SO SO SOMETHING THAT FEELS VERY PARADOXICAL BETWEEN LOCATEDNESS AND RELATIONALITY %bcack BUT I DO THINK THAT THE METAPHOR OF OF RAPTURE GETS LOCAL IT GETS SECULAR AND IT GETS EMBODIED NOW I WANTED TO NOTICE SOMETHING AND MAYBE HAVE SOME PEOPLE COMMENT ON IT I WAS CURIOUS IN MY NOTES ON JOAN'S TALK WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE SEGUE IN JOAN'S TALK I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN ALTER ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF AND THE NEXT THING I I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN IS RECIPROCAL ALTERITY NOW HAVING RE ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF HAS BEEN COMMENTED ON BY BY NATHALIE NATHANAEL BODY STUFFED FULL OF MIND SUGGESTS ALTERITY BY TRISH INCLUDING IN THE LAST COMMENT ABOUT A TRANCE LIKE AMENITY GOING TOWARDS TRANSCENDENCE TOO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF AND IN BY REYNALDO IN A WAY IN ONE OF THE ACQUAINTANCES ON LEATHER AND FISHNET A AND SO I WAS WONDERING HOW WHEN YOU HAVE ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF WHICH IS PATENT AND LIKE BEEN PLAYED OUT AND AND COMMENTED ON ONE ALSO CAN PRODUCE A RECIPROCAL ALTERITY WITH THE OTHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF THE PLAYERS HAVE MULTIPLIED %bcack THAT IS IF EVERY SELF HAS ALTERITIES OF VARIOUS KINDS AND THE ETHICAL GOAL IS RECIPROCAL ALTERI RECIPROCAL ALTERITY {it's / it is / it has} {there's / there is / there has} BEEN A A TO MORPH INTO A POLYNEME A POLYVALENT SPACE THIS IS VERY VERY INTERESTING AND {that's / that is / that has} WHAT I HAD NOTICED IN THE TERMS OF A R OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM DO THIS A LOT OF THINGS NEED TO BE SAID AND I WONDERED WHETHER IF ANYONE ELSE NOTICED IT THEY WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON IT THAT IS THE AMPLE PROBLEM WITH SIMPLE ALTERITY WHEN ONE IS FISSURED INTO WRITING PRAISE JUST THE SMALL MATHEMATICAL QUESTION YOU KNOW SUBJECT TO OTHER SUBJECT AT ALTERITY WITHIN THE SUBJECT AND SUBJECT RIGHT OTHER ABJECT AND I TH AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WITH REGARDS TO THE LEVINAS IN QUESTION OF YOU KNOW THE FEMININE AND AND THE OTHER AND {that's / that is / that has} THEN BECOMING CONFOUNDED WITH WOMEN AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WOMEN THAT OCCUPY THE MASCULINE RELATION TO THE FEMININE THEN SORT OF FRAMING WHAT IS LEFT OUT OF THAT AS ACTUALLY AND IN BETWEEN A SORT OF DESTROYED GROUND WHICH MIGHT BE THE ENEMY THE PALESTINIAN FOR LEVINAS IT MIGHT BE IT IT MIGHT BE THE UNMARKED THE UNRECLAIMABLE BODY AND THAT AND SO FOR ME THE ETHICAL QUESTION HAD LESS TO DO WITH THE CONSTITUENT OF MISRECOGNITION BETWEEN OUR OWN ALTERITY AND OTHERS WHICH IS AN ASYMMETRICAL LANDSCAPE AND AND {we are / we were} NEGOTIATING BUT THE FURTHER VIOLENCE OF AN UNMARKED TERRAIN WHICH ENABLES EVEN PLOTTING SELF OTHER YEAH X %bcack YEAH SO PUTTING THE THIRD IN IS REALLY PUTTING A THIRD'S ATTRITION WITHIN YEAH %bcack WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT NOT A DIALECTIC BUT IS {it's / it is / it has} NOT THE THE DIA BUT {it's / it is / it has} SOME OTHER SPACE {that's / that is / that has} VERY INTERESTING YEAH A LITTLE BIT YEAH YEAH %bcack YEAH {that's / that is / that has} { he's / he was / he is / he has} LOVED FOR THAT TIME %bcack {it's / it is / it has} GREAT NO I D I do not HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT WITH {what's / what is / what has / what does} JUST BEEN SAID I I THINK THAT THE MOMENT ONE recogniseS AN ALTERITY WITHIN {one's / one is / one was / one has} SELF ONE IS %bcack RECOGNIZING THE RECIPROCITY OF ALL ALTERITY BECAUSE ALTERITY IS NOT ONLY ABOUT OTHERS OUTSIDE OF ONESELF AND I DO THINK THAT THE VECTORS OF ALTERITIES GO IN IN MANY DIRECTIONS THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS IS NOT A VERY FULL STATEMENT BUT IT BUT IT LEADS TO THE QUESTION OR IT RAISES QUESTIONS OF THE NATURE OF PRACTICES WITHIN A A WORLDSCAPE WHERE YOU CAN BE MAPPING RECIPROCAL ALTERITIES RATHER THAN MAPPING LESS THAN ALTERITIES IN THE %bcack YEAH %bcack X %bcack I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT NOW THING I THINK i am GOING TO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE THAT THAT IS HOW YOU GET THERE BUT I THINK A AN AWFUL LOT TO SAY IS POSSIBLE TO recognise WITNESS WITHIN THEMSELVES AND NOT RELATE TO STILL BE ABLE TO LIKE TO THE OTHER AND NOT AND NOT RELATE YOU KNOW NOT {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT NOT MOVE IN THAT WAY THAT WE WE LIKE WE HAVE THE IDEAL EPIDURAL RELATIONSHIP SO ONE CAN SAY YOU KNOW I recognise THIS ME AND THAT ME AND NOT YOU YOU KNOW YEAH YEAH FOR SURE FOR SURE YEAH {they are / they were} NOT SUPPOSED TO GET DOWN I LOVE THAT THING YEAH VALERIE NO I THINK {it's / it is / it has} AGAIN I THINK {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THOSE NECESSARILY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT MEN {they are / they were} NOT NOT VERBS THAT THAT YOU YOU CERTAINLY CAN recognise OTHER THAN {what's / what is / what has / what does} WITHIN YOURSELF AND {you had / you would} BE BLIND TO OTHERS PERIOD BUT IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DYNAMIC OF RECIPROCATION
