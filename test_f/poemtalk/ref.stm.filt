PoemTalk-198_On-three-Larry-Price-poems A Speaker1 0.86 361.756 AND THAT THE WHOLE PERSONIFICATION THAT HAPPENS WITHIN YOUR WORK AND ESPECIALLY THEIRS {it's / it is / it has} TO SHOW THAT WHOSE MONOLOGUE IS IT SO TO SPEAK X INNER MONOLOGUE WHEN I ANY ONE IDEA STANDS ON STAGE FOR SEVEN SECONDS SO THE IDEA HAS some how BECOME THE PRESENTER OF THE MONOLOGUE {that's / that is / that has} E E {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT I MEAN THE QUESTION REALLY BECOMES WHY WHY ARE WE WRITING WHO IS IT {that's / that is / that has} WRITING WHY DID THAT START WRITING WHAT STARTED WRITING WHAT IS WRITING TO WHAT AND SO ON I MEAN THERE ARE ALL THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW IT AN I IS IT AN I AND i am NOT SO SURE THAT I WANT TO INVEST EVERYTHING THAT i am DOING IN ANY PARTICULAR PLACE ONE PLACE BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW TIME AND SPACE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMPLICATED AND I do not THINK THE WRITING COMES OUT OF ANY ONE PLACE I THINK IT COMES OUT OF THIS AS I SAID THIS MELANGE OF OF DEBRIS FORCES FACTORS OPERATORS {it's / it is / it has} YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} COMPLEX AND SO YOU HAVE i am REALLY INTERESTED IN BUT X BUT CURIOUSLY HERE YOU YOU THEN BUT YOU AND I ARE HERE NOW %bcack WELL I LOVE THAT TRYING TO BIND RIGHT I MEAN BUT {it's / it is / it has} AN ADDRESS YOU KNOW X X TO THE SUPPOSITION I I LOVE i will BE ANDY WARHOL i will BE IN OTHER WORDS {we are / we were} GOING TO TRY SO TRY SOME IDENTITY ON FOR SIZE %bcack I WILL BE AND YOU WILL BE every one X YOU BE YOU BE YOU BE OH I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT LIKE WALGREENS OR SOMETHING {it's / it is / it has} X OVER IN AISLE B X OH SORRY {that's / that is / that has} all right YOU CAN ADD A BIG THIS IS WHAT WE GET WITH BILL X {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT SO BUT {it's / it is / it has} NOT i will BE GEORGE PATTON i will BE SOME SOLID CHARACTER %bcack {it's / it is / it has} ANDY WARHOL COURSE ANDY WAS ACTUALLY A MIRROR YOU KNOW what ever YOU KNOW AND ANDY WAS NOT INTERESTED IN IDENTITY SELFHOOD AND SO IF YOU AND I ARE HERE NOW SEEMS LIKE A SOLID SOCI SOCIALITY YOU KNOW AN AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN BE MEANING WE CAN MAKE MEANING TOGETHER WE CAN COCREATE THIS THING {that's / that is / that has} HAPPENING HERE MAYBE IN THIS POEM AND THEN IN DOING SO i will BE ANDY WARHOL AND YOU BE every one ELSE WHAT we have ESTABLISHED IS A PERSONA THAT IS AN ANTIPERSONA AND SET AGAINST THAT IS A KIND OF AN ENTIRE AUDIENCE MAYBE every one WHO READS THIS POEM OR {who's / who is / who has} SITTING IN IN THE CROWD GETS TO BE every one ELSE BUT {it's / it is / it has} NOT DISTINCT FROM THE I BECAUSE I WILL BE NOTHING AND YOU WILL BE NOTHING ANTITED TALK ANTITED TALK SAY A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ANTITED TALK BECAUSE BECAUSE I THINK TED TALK I do not THINK THAT LARRY WAS THINKING OF TED TALK BUT THAT IS EVERYTHING {that's / that is / that has} WRONG WITH SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE YEAH I THINK {it's / it is / it has} DISLODGING MONOLOGUE FROM LIKE ITS AUTHORITARIANISM AND {it's / it is / it has} MAKING THE THE POEM'S EXISTENCE IS AN INVITATION FOR A CONNECTION BETWEEN AUDIENCE AND SPEAKER X SO {it's / it is / it has} NOT {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} INVITING THE COLlabourATION OF BOTH PARTS THAT CREATE THE OCCASION FOR MEETING ANYWAY {it's / it is / it has} NOT I TALK YOU LISTEN I KNOW YOU do not YES {it's / it is / it has} RIGHT IT SAYS WHICH COMES IN PARTS OF CERTAINTY THE MONOLOGUE does not HAVE {it's / it is / it has} CERTAIN BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE MONOLOGUE IS SAYING %bcack {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT BEFORE X WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE I AND I WAS DISOWNING THE I BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO OWN UP TO IT YOU HAVE TO SAY all right i will TAKE THIS ON FOR THIS MOMENT JUST FOR THE A ABSOLUTE FACT FACT OF CONNECTION AND {that's / that is / that has} NOT IRONIC IN THE LEAST {that's / that is / that has} ACTUALLY QUITE X WELL X X ETHICAL X ABSOLUTELY {it's / it is / it has} ETHICAL BUT IS IS IRONY UNETHICAL I do not THINK SO NO IT is not X BUT TH THE PROBLEM WITH TED TALK ISM IS THAT THEY S THE IMPLICATION IS WE NEED MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME YOU KNOW WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONSERVATION YOU KNOW AND i have BEEN THROUGH THIS AND {you are / you were} AN AUDIENCE {who's / who is / who has} LISTENING TO ME AND {it's / it is / it has} USUALLY VERY PERSONAL AND VERY PHILOSOPHICAL BUT {it's / it is / it has} FACT FIFTEEN FUCKING MINUTES OF FAME A TED TALK {you are / you were} TRYING TO GET THROUGH S YOU WANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE {it's / it is / it has} MORE THAN THAT I THINK ABSOLUTELY AND AT I MEAN {there's / there is / there has} I MEAN X YES I {can not / cannot} SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT I MEAN I REALLY AGREE WITH WHAT {you are / you were} SAYING I THINK THAT YOU KNOW A AGAIN I we have GOT LOTS OF STRAW PEOPLE AROUND AND TH THEY WALK AROUND LOOKING AND SOUNDING VERY IMPORTANT ONLY BECAUSE WE ELECTED THEM AND YOU KNOW WE CAN JUST DISELECT THEM I THINK AND AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE GET TO LIKE TAKE UP ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT ROLES IN SOME KIND OF COOPERATIVE IN THIS CASE X YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} ALL STAGES OF DRAMA BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} EVERYWHERE THAT WE ARE SO BILL THOUGHT ANOTHER THOUGHT ON THIS PIECE BEFORE TURN TO THE THIRD ONE WELL X I LOVE THIS TYPICAL INVERSION THAT WE GET HERE BETWEEN A CROWD AND A EMPTY STAGE OR A STAGE AND AN EMPTY CROWD {that's / that is / that has} KIND OF UNFORTUNATE is not IT I MEAN I did not WANT TO IMPLY THAT THE CROWD WAS EMPTY ALTOGETHER EMPTY BUT I THINK THAT {there's / there is / there has} A POSSIBILITY {that's / that is / that has} A LOT OF TIMES IT IS BECAUSE THE CROWD COMES WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT INVEST THE PERFORMANCE WITH MORE SOLIDITY AND IMPORTANCE THAN IT ACTUALLY DESERVES AND TO ME THAT ALL THAT DOES IS EMPTY THE CROWD'S EXPECTATIONS ONTO THE STAGE WHERE THOSE EXPECTATIONS THEN ACT OUT I do not WANT THAT I WANT COMPLETE CONTINGENCY I WANT THE ACCIDENT THE UNPREDICTABLE I WANT TO Y YOU KNOW FEEL THAT THERE MIGHT BE ALL KINDS OF ENCOUNTERS THAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW AT ANY GIVEN TIME WE JUST NEED TO BE OPEN TO THAT X I THINK {that's / that is / that has} EM EMBEDDED IN THOUGH IN THAT R
