times that come to us in a direct line as light moving at a pretty pace People in delirium move toward it It has one of nature's failings Loveliness is not deluxe when it's uncertain Strange we have come back So this type study is what started all the trouble with any others coming  um I'd long been a fan of her work and had on weaving and knew it well It hadn't um  I just saw it differently one day and I went to um some lengths to try to publish it and it took a lot Just wanted to cover the things that I do and that that  and um they put me in touch with the author's foundation which opened up a little bit of a Pandora's box because they brought out so many amazing things when I went to visit I was then  in  um so I studied weaving and then started working on my own little type studies and um I don't know about you but when I do monotonous work like hammering away on a you know a gridded typewriter space like this I'm always listening to things so at this point I was listening to a l  really amazing interview with um Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein It's one of the the very early line break and everything was fresh but they just  they had this stellar conversation about landscape and page space where Susan Howe equates page space to freedom Salt and sand this is Annie and Joseph had Black Mountain College and this is Laura County Livingfield one of Annie's students uh One of the few people to graduate from Black Mountain as I recall And uh she took the weaving course from Annie and from um another teacher there And uh thankfully got like two hundred pages of extraordinary notes all hand typed with lots of draft notation and drawings um  and while I was at the Elder's Archive or actually a little bit up there after I digitized her entire file because it was de deteriorating rather rapidly and maybe of lesser value than some of the other things there um So I scanned it and I have it and now I'm just wondering  wondering what to do I'm gonna give a talk uh in a few days on the archive but like other projects it takes me a long time to sort of get far enough to  that I know what I'm doing with something so I just spent a lot of time learning um I did trace the type studies from Black Mountain back to the Bauhau This is a um a weaving uh um  cloth sample book of some of the type designs This is my favorite Bauhaus study um done by Haja Rose of uh just zeroes and lines Isn't it gorgeous Hm So it's A Million Random Digits See I totaled them up Yeah Think John Cage used this quite a bit track some of them down So those of you who weave or um might weave would know that weaving's all about numbers so every thread  every intersection of the thread corresponds to at least two numbers um so even though you're looking at a very simple piece of cloth you could really draw it out numerically in its entirety um So the piece that I did for the the book was simply a transcription  uh a lovely transcription of that page space  I was giving a talk recently and then I did a little homework on etymology of text and textile and they come from the very same  stem to weave But I love the text actually has a   uh even a more fabric description of style tissue of literary work literally that which is woven web texture So nice the way it's there so  there early on so that's it Thought we could open it up to questions You gave us have plenty of time um I'm curious about the Dickinson quotes um I notice from the images that there were uh it seem it seemed to me specifically that there's a bunch of similar markings but they're slightly different Do they correspond to a certain thing like from the work Like the the the the the way that you sewed the fabric in just the pregnant did it like  how does that  how did you figure out what what what to put where Right um It's uh as faithful a transcription as I could make so what I did was I scanned Dickinson's manuscript books which you you have here you have a fantastic Dickinson collection um So it's a two volume book of um the folio work that she did and there are actually a a ton more uh manu  uh her manuscripts that aren't in that edition so that are far more beautiful even the strange the light fragments um But I worked with that because it showed the variant system so all those crosses that you saw embroidered um precede words and the words correspond to other words preceded by a cross within the poem um So there's this rather intense um system of alternate or um other ways to read poems uh and they're very strange I mean sometimes they're close like uh  like further and farther which aren't really close at all and sometimes they're like um like the lines like 'tis is  'tis as if our souls absconded suddenly and the variant is souls and the variants below the poem are world selves and sun Oh Oh so either  any of those could happen And then when you start to read the variants wha  between poems so say souls i is a variant more than once then you have a very complex way that you start to get to read Yeah x
