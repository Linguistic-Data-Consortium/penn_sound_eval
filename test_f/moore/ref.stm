Moore-Richard_Complete-Reading_Lee-Anderson_Berkeley_03-23-52 A Subject 0.36 404.029 Keeping in the sheep or keeping the sheep out of the field that was not the appointed pasture The deliberate spacing of the fenceposts was as plain as the apparently undeliberate spacing of the clumped wild iris The iris in the field that the fence kept the sheep from But this was when the fence was new and is not what the fence is Bulged where the sheep have leaned not one of the posts straight Broken in places the regular spaces an abstraction The rectangles are untrue And through the holes the sheep have passed from one field into the next field cropping the wild iris and lessening the apparent distinction between field and field It is dangerous to say with the words rusting as the old wire fence red where the galvanizing has worn off Whether the fence has suffered a kind of death or whether the fence stands askew and broken as a sign of separation or the death of seperation The fence inseparable from that place between field and field The Night Sea Under the rain the trees like crow feet scratch tangling the spittle sky These are the elements that give my heart ease and make its watch run regular as the rain solemn as the crow its claw grip into the wet returning wind The blear watering face is washed and smeared on the ditch running ruinous page one page for each year of my age and each caw of the mind is the watery wage that my tears pay for my tongue's relief That never again for time telling heart ease or the song that fills the true shape of a pain For the heart is struck by the frog spearing rain and is washed away without feature or the mere fire that dropped on its first birthday Night flooding fog at the eaves of the year all unwilling in whit quenches like fire drenched in a hulk sea smothered and swallowed towed under the wave stowed safe home again from the wakening rain that freshens green crests of the scudding hills rakes the clean air launches crows from the field It is under the night sea the uneasy grave of sleep I am sown laced in a jacket of ills bedded naked and wheeled down the shafts of the swallowing sea to wake once more to the wrath of the heart speaking rain in the spittle dawn aged in the old rebirth of the first day And I thirst again for my cold death that spoke me oblivion paid my wage that my tongue should speak It was deceit deceit wind rioting like the hurly burly crow shadow falling upon shadow in the field The yield picked clean not a grain but green caught before its spring Damp rocked in the husk reeks No rainbow nor fathering of the swinking sun can raise what was laid down in the mothering mire but picked clean before oh an eternity before its first day's dawning and the husk can rattle in the rambling wind swim in the streaming seas among islands of crows But it goes blind and mindless under the coffin nailing rain that sands the husked house thin as the bony starved crows clawed to the fence They have eaten the silence The Fig Tree The leaves large for so small a tree moved one against the other in the deep green air And the light amid bays and inlets of the leaves rippled where the ripe figs hung purple in that green pool almost bursting in the cool water of the air It was fearful to plunge Although all summer's rightness hung there In the deep pool it moved rippling in the muscular light and shade And it was fear in its multiple saying forms the rank rightness of the fig swelled out and abandoned fearful to reach to Heavy and filled the burst figs fell at intervals in the afternoon and I saw in your eyes still in that pool of air the livid bruise of the same indifferent fall The Hawk The hawk's cry from the tall sky fell but my hazel eye against a blue and lidless eye was set My stare went only into blue distance wastes of air each augury of Hell invisible to my sense There was an eagle set on a molding book in the attic Full of moth holes he was yet terrible in my childhood I pulled his feathers but they stuck and dodge as I would his blind glass look spoiled my young luck Wife and child brought new eyes to flesh that had grown wild in the high wood of a green world
