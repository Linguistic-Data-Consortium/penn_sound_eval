THEY BOTH LOOK EQUALLY ALIVE ONE ASLEEP IN FLESH THE OTHER EYES CLOSED AWAKE IN STONE i am GOING TO READ A FEW NEW THINGS WHICH YOU MAY N MAY OR NOT NOTICE BUT {they are / they were} {they are / they were} SORT OF DIFFERENT TO IT BECAUSE {they are / they were} OH i will SAY EIGHTY SIX WHERE ARE WE NOW THIS IS TWO THOUSAND TEN SO {that's / that is / that has} S SIXTEEN YEARS RIGHT TWENTY FOUR YEARS TWENTY FOUR THANKS YEAH YEAH IT WAS A THERE WAS A ANYBODY ANY ANYBODY LISTEN TO CAR TALK YEAH SO THEY W THEY TOLD THIS JOKE ABOUT SOMEBODY on line AND IT YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} AT THE SUPERMARKET AND {it's / it is / it has} LIKE TEN ITEMS OR LESS AND THE PERSON HAS ALL THESE ITEMS YOU KNOW THAT { he's / he was / he is / he has} UNLOADING ONTO THE CONVEYOR BELT AND THE CASHIER SAYS TO HIM YOU KNOW EITHER {you are / you were} FROM MIT WHICH MEANS YOU {can not / cannot} READ OR {you are / you were} FROM HARVARD WHICH MEANS YOU {can not / cannot} COUNT SO SO {you are / you were} FROM HARVARD YEAH WELL NOT FROM HARVARD BUT ANYWAY YEAH all right LET ME START WITH MY NEWEST PIECE AND AND KIND OF WORK BACKWARDS {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} A GREAT WAY TO SEE IF A POEM WORKS IS TO READ IT ALOUD TO TO PEOPLE SO NOW I HAVE TO AGAIN GIVE YOU SOME BACKSTORY HERE THERE WAS {there's / there is / there has} A FILM THAT CAME OUT IN NEW YORK I IT IT WAS APPEARED AT A COUPLE OF THEATERS AND IT HAD A SHORT RUN A FEW MONTHS AGO CALLED AN UNFINISHED FILM AND THE OCCASION OF THE FILM WAS THAT SOME FOOTAGE FROM THE WARSAW GHETTO WAS UNEARTHED NO ONE KNEW ABOUT AND AND I F i am FORGETTING THE NAME OF THIS DIRECTOR UTTERLY BRILLIANT DIRECTOR SHE TOOK THIS FOOTAGE AND PUT TOGETHER THIS AMAZING FILM WITH VOICEOVER AND SO ON AND SO THIS IS A POEM ABOUT WATCHING THAT FILM NOW LET ME JUST TELL YOU IF YOU do not KNOW ABOUT THE FILM {it's / it is / it has} NOT LIKE {it's / it is / it has} NOT LIKE THE THE FILM FOOTAGE OF THERESIENSTADT AND MAYBE SOME PEOPLE do not KNOW WHAT THERESIENSTADT WAS BUT DURING WORLD WAR TWO THE GERMANS CREATED A A F A FAKE OR A MOCK U NOT WELL NO A A FAKE CONCENTRATION CAMP AND THEY THEY FILMED EVERYBODY THERE AND THE PEOPLE LOOKED WELL FED AND THEY WERE DOING INTERESTING THINGS AND THEY WERE HAPPY THESE THESE WERE THE JEWS WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM O ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE AND PLACED THERE AND IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A PROPAGANDA THING YOU KNOW WELL AN UNFINISHED FILM THE PERSON WHO DEVISED THIS THIS FILM HAD A VER HAD SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IN MIND BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST HAVE IT WELL I MEAN I THINK INITIALLY THEY WANTED IT THE GERMANS WANTED IT TO BE FOR PUBLICITY BUT THEY KIND OF WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR OR THEY REALLY GOT TOO INVOLVED BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} CLEAR FROM THE FROM THE FOUND FOOTAGE AND BY THE WAY {there's / there is / there has} LIKE A SECOND CAMERA AND THERE MAY HAVE EVEN IN AT CERTAIN POINTS BEEN A THIRD CAMERA SO LIKE THE SECOND CAMERA WILL SHOW THE FIRST CAMERAMAN FILMING THE INHABITANTS OF THE GHETTO WHO ARE BEING MADE TO ACT IN CERTAIN SC IN CERTAIN SCENES THAT HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED AND AND IN FACT ONE OF THE CAMERAMEN WAS FOUND AND WAS INTERVIEWED FOR THE FILM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THE WARSAW GHETTO WHO ARE ALSO THEY {they are / they were} FILMED WATCHING THE FOOTAGE AND THEN MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND WE WELL SO SO SO THE SCENES ARE AND THIS IS LIKE EARLY IN THE WARSAW GHETTO SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE FROM ALL OVER YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY THAN THAN OTHERS AND YOU KNOW SO I MEAN YOU SEE P YOU SEE BODIES LYING IN THE STREET {it's / it is / it has} NOT THAT THE GERMANS ARE NOT TRYING TO SHOW THAT BUT WHAT THEY DECIDED TO DO WAS TO SHOW THAT AND THEN SHOW THE WAY PEOPLE REACTED TO THAT KIND OF THING SO they will HAVE PEOPLE they will they will DO TWENTY TAKES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF WELL DRESSED AND ALSO POOR PEOPLE WALKING AROUND A BODY {that's / that is / that has} LYING ON THE SIDEWALK OR A BAKERY AND {there's / there is / there has} A COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE WINDOW AND they will SHOW THE THE REALLY RAGGEDY PEOPLE LOOKING AT LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY THEY PARADE THE WELL SHOD JEWS IN YOU KNOW AS IF {they are / they were} GOING TO BUY SOMETHING AND THEY DO THA YOU KNOW YOU SEE ONE TAKE AFTER ANOTHER SO W I THINK WHAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW THE SURMISAL IS THAT SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY realiseD THAT THIS FILM WAS WAS A LITTLE TOO REVEALING AND IT DOES SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW A S A PERHAPS A NEED TO SHAME PEOPLE RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW KILL THEM YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY THIS IS THIS IS MY POEM ABOUT THAT FILM AND IT I do not KNOW IF ANYBODY KNOWS THE POETRY OF HUGH SEIDMAN BUT HE WRITES THESE VERY TERSE
