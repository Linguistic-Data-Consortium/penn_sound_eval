YOU ARE NOT FRENCH FIRST IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FUCK with out THINKING OF OEUFS SUR LE PLAT OR OF BEING WELCOMED TO PARIS AT NIGHT AFTER A LONG BORING TRAIN RIDE FOR WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT THEY MAKE YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TRAVELED A LONG WAY AND MIGHT AS WELL TAKE WHAT COMES AND COME TO WHAT WILL TAKE YOU BUT NOT SAINT BRIDGET SHE COMES FIRST NO MATTER HOW FAST YOU ARE AND LINGERS LAST NOT JUST FOR BREAKFAST BUT FOR THE WHOLE FUCKING WEEKEND AND LASTS AND LASTS {that's / that is / that has} HOW AMERICAN WOMEN ARE AND YOU {can not / cannot} BE FRENCH FIRST UNLESS YOU MOVE PRETTY FAST AND SAINT

MANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE {it's / it is / it has} THE VIOLENCE THAT COUNTS I THINK EVERYTHING BEGAN ON AUGUST THIRTIETH NINETEEN THIRTY NINE I do not THINK ANYTHING IS INTERESTING BEFORE THAT EXCEPT THAT I DISCOVERED IT LATER I do not CARE WHEN SAINT BRIDGET WAS BORN OR DAVIDE OR MICHELANGELO OR DIAGHILEV OR WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS THEY STARTED WITH ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT THEM FIRST I BUILT THE CHURCH OF SAINT BRIDGET AND FEEL RESPONSIBLE THAT {it's / it is / it has} CROOKED I AM {everybody's / everybody is / everybody has} VICTIM EXCEPT JOAN MITCHELL'S NOT ONLY THAT YOU ARE A VERY SAD PERSON TOO is not HE SAINT BRIDGET IF ONLY I HAD MORE MD I would not BE SUCH AN EVIL PERSON GOING AROUND ADMIRING CROOKED STEEPLES AND INEFFECTUAL SAINTS AND JUST TO SHOW HOW TOTALLY LIKE THE neighbourHOOD I AM i will CONFESS THAT WHEN I RUN OUT OF MILK I DRINK IT BLACK { how's / how is / how has / how was / how does} THAT { how's / how is / how has / how was / how does} THAT FOR COMMITMENT {that's / that is / that has} MD MATER DOLOROSA %bcack NOW I HAVE TO READ ALL BY MYSELF AGAIN NO I do not ACTUALLY THIS IS A POEM THAT IS ANOTHER COLlabourATION ONE I STILL FIND REALLY VERY INTERESTING WRITTEN WITH LARRY FAGIN AND RON PADGETT {it's / it is / it has} CALLED VARIATIONS ON A THEME WITH WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS AND THE WAY THIS POEM WAS WRITTEN WAS LARRY AND RON AND I WERE SITTING A AT RON'S HOUSE ONE AFTERNOON AND WE FOR ONE REASON ANOTHER IN THE CONVERSATION RECALLED A POEM OF WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS' WHICH {you are / you were} GOING TO HEAR IN THREE VERSIONS WE TRIED TO RECALL HOW THE POEM WENT OR HOW IT WAS WRITTEN AND SO EACH OF {us / u. s.} WROTE OUT OUR OWN SENSE OF HOW THE POEM WENT HOW THE LINES BROKE AND WHAT THE WORDS IN IN THE WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS POEM WERE AND THIS IS WHAT WE GOT ONE TWO THREE ONE I HAVE EATEN THE PLUMS IN THE ICEBOX WHICH YOU WERE PROBABLY SAVING FOR BREAKFAST FORGIVE ME THEY WERE DELICIOUS SO COLD AND SO SWEET TWO I HAVE EATEN THE PLUMS THAT WERE IN THE ICEBOX AND WHICH YOU WERE PROBABLY SAVING FOR BREAKFAST FORGIVE ME THEY WERE SO DELICIOUS SO SWEET AND COLD THREE i am SORRY I ATE THE PLUMS YOU YOU HAD IN THE ICEBOX AND WHICH YOU HAD INTENDED FOR BREAKFAST THEY WERE REALLY GOOD COLD AND SWEET AND RON ALREADY READ THE NEXT POEM SO ELECTION DAY FOG THE PERFECT ROUNDNESS HALO AND DENSITY OF HEADLIGHTS COMING FROM BEHIND AS I WALK UPHILL HEADING TOWARDS THE HOUSE WHERE WARMTH MAY FREELY SPREAD ITS MUTED GRACE NOTES LIKE PORK CHOPS COOKING {it's / it is / it has} BEEN A SHORT DAY JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER OF DECISIONS TOO EVERYTHING ELSE HAS EVERYTHING ELSE SAYS THE LIGHT OF ANOTHER STRIPE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT ONE IS GOING UP IN SMOKE MEANWHILE THE PAST IS CALLING IT ALL COMES BACK MORE OR LESS AMUSING LIKE THE ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY A STUDIED LOOK INTO THE NOT TOO DISTANT WINNING FLAME IS THERE A PITCHER OF WATER AROUND OR DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA BEER THERE TED IF SO IS THAT WATER LET ME COME UP TO THE STAGE {we had / we would} EITHER WAY i will MEET YOU HALFWAY ACTUALLY X TAKE YOUR TIME TAKE THAT o. k.
