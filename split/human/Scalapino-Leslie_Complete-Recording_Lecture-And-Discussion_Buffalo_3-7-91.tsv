Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	27.663	29.41	But yet as you said before	Unknown1	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	31.176	32.397	in relation to the poems ((it))	Unknown1

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	35.362	36.623	but as recorded	Unknown1	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	37.226	40.147	it seems to somehow want to ((just))	Unknown1	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	40.459	43.994	push the limits of what would otherwise be considered a moment.	Unknown1	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	44.483	47.614	And you also use the expression resonance and duration.	Unknown1	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	48.061	49.785	I think that that is sort of a	Unknown1

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	54.46	56.074	((a)) characterization of this moment.	Unknown1	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	56.928	61.246	Right, well it's the conflict between the fact that you can apprehend	Subject

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	75.111	81.265	would be it's impossible and also that your perception or your being in the moment, the moment doesn't exist anyway.	Subject	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	82.094	84.074	um So it's attempting to	Subject

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	86.099	89.491	In other words that you've completely fabricated this ((and)) your sense of the moment	Subject

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	94.551	102.606	um So I relate that to that previous question of whether something's being nullified. In a sense there is that, ((that uh)) it has to be your understanding	Subject	
Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	102.995	107.616	that you can only exist in the present, but you're never in it and that it	Subject
