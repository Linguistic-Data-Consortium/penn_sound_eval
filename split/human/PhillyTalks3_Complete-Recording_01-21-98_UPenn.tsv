PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	2.03	5.356	particularly telling and why I find it a compelling argument	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	5.64	6.435	because it does	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	6.78	7.717	challenge	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	7.84	10.214	in some ways and initiate a bit of a rupture	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	10.687	11.822	with a l-	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	11.9	14.803	# uh a poetics of desire and a libidinal economy	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	15.057	16.112	but it also	Speaker1

PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	17.29	19.537	initiates this act of pointing	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	20.06	22.06	um which I see a lot	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	22.25	25.13	of in work of my contemporaries.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	25.348	31.072	who are spread out, not located um geographically in any particular area	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	31.34	35.26	um that their work p- points to particular social facts	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	35.43	37.322	usually that are disgusting	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	37.75	44.396	or not so much that the facts are disgusting, but the people are disgusted by the facts, they're disgusted by their economic situation.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	44.602	46.013	They're disgusted by	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	46.27	47.501	in Canada how	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	47.847	52.54	following the fifth term of Reagan administration, America, Canada has to	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	52.815	54.655	mock the same thing and=	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	54.96	56.183	and how um	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	56.65	58.07	arts funding is being	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	58.24	60.46	stripped away ((and)) essentially	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	60.914	63.609	uh a gospel of facts from the right	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	63.8	65.222	has been initiated that	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	65.647	66.541	(()) debt	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	66.769	67.22	((and))	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	67.27	70.04	a national debt cannot be challenged in any way that=	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	70.719	74.43	that ((so)) the gospel (()) we can't spend because there's a debt.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	74.69	77.773	We have to somehow get rid of this debt before there can be	Speaker1

PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	79.85	81.935	any social services left again.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	82.03	83.993	So ((I was)) interested in it for its	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	84.05	85.28	ability to	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	85.61	88.995	make some sort of challenge and rupture and also because	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	89.26	92.74	it um articulates this movement towards	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	93.085	94.316	pointing at	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	94.46	95.8	and registering	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	96.01	99.35	disgust and anger with these social facts.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	99.75	100.995	Having said that,	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	101.179	102.357	I think that	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	102.83	103.906	it's also	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	104.22	106.545	an contingent poetics. I don't think	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	106.71	113.352	a poetics of disgust, if it gets taken seriously, if it gets picked up by and discussed by anyone ((and I))	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	113.58	115.0	hope it does because	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	115.55	120.312	having spent the time ((editing)) the issue I think ((there's a)) # it's a really interesting collection of people.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	120.48	122.534	I think it's a contingent poetics.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	122.86	124.837	Which is something that I see emerging	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	125.01	126.802	cross many different communities	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	126.93	128.34	where the kind of larger	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	128.44	131.139	plans that lead to larger works	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	131.212	132.016	are being	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	132.18	134.42	shunted aside in order to have	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	134.53	136.606	a contingent poetics that's	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	136.76	138.914	based on a more momentary	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	138.981	140.794	set of social relations	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	141.01	146.22	and then we could again invoke the homology of social relations in the text there	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	146.34	148.138	((or if)) social relations have sped up	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	148.328	149.842	((then)) one's poetics	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	149.9	151.66	aren't going to be locked in.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	151.77	153.765	How are you going to address a rapidly	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	153.912	157.771	transforming social sphere with a static poetics.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	158.191	160.6	So I see this as a move from	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	161.28	162.864	desire to disgust	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	162.941	164.172	but also from	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	164.86	166.723	um a more stable	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	166.87	168.475	long term plan	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	168.649	174.351	which um Michel de Certeau would register as a strategy towards a shorter term	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	174.42	177.236	tactic of the um contingent.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	181.86	182.845	{cough}	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	183.484	192.422	I feel ((there's)) a bit of a presidential debate sort of here. Quite= quite interest-. I'm just waiting for the (()) commemorative coins (()) very, very nice.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	192.487	195.646	It'll look so great painted on plates. um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	194.572	195.151	Yeah.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	197.15	198.84	((I mean)) it= it= it sounds	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	199.86	202.452	(()) ((this is)) going to be crude because I haven't read the issue	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	202.973	204.268	and uh	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	204.778	208.09	of the people you mentioned in that issue I think I= I know	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	208.23	211.375	some of the work of all but uh one of them but	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	212.244	213.25	um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	214.15	218.0	had never thought of them in terms of= a= of a collectivity	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	218.373	219.225	um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	219.431	221.86	and ((uh which)) I think actually one of the constant	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	222.11	223.87	sort of ((underwriting)) issues	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	224.38	226.113	um that goes on	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	226.79	231.05	for poets of my generation looking at poets of your generation.	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	231.064	231.606	Mhm.	Speaker1	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	231.747	235.17	Steve Evans today um in his poetics uh	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	235.69	237.864	uh email discussion ((once)) told me to	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	238.21	239.571	change my song	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	239.7	245.792	uh about this um and uh I responded that I will when it's warranted.	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	246.228	247.357	um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	249.12	251.498	It= it sounds to me from the description	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	252.04	253.93	as though um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	254.14	255.756	((having)) reinvented	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	256.42	259.331	a Brechtian poetics um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	260.649	264.604	there would then be a positing, and I'm not sure exactly where,	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	265.049	266.227	um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	266.47	273.64	sort of the um # the uh inverse (()) you know, ((and)) identified our ((toe,)) and I don't know who that gets to be, whether that gets to be	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	273.99	277.671	people of my generation generally or a specific phenomenon.	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	277.914	278.889	um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	279.284	280.376	Within that	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	280.587	281.658	and	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	283.5	289.926	it feels to me # it= it feels to me in that sense um invariably problematic because # ((of course)) I= I	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	290.14	293.206	I'm one of these people who tends to think that, you know,	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	293.35	297.736	you want Brecht and Artaud sort of constantly talking to one another.	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	297.984	298.9	um	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	299.23	300.59	At the same time	Speaker2

PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	309.245	310.177	problematic.	Speaker2	
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	310.24	313.69	It also seems problematic to actually think of the tactical	Speaker2
