Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	2.48	5.036	There's a promised land, right in the body	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	5.77	11.22	but the land is overrun by creatures who feel that someone must get the trains to run on time.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	17.551	18.584	What day is it?	Speaker1

Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	41.27	42.796	and reintegrates.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	43.83	46.88	In the process I lose a tiny bit	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	47.243	48.047	of my	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	48.199	49.174	integrity.	Speaker1

Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	96.524	97.739	but the world is death.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	98.391	99.83	The many forms of death.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	100.33	101.492	Defeated death,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	101.72	103.88	resigned death, surprised death,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	104.561	105.53	slow death,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	106.226	107.404	anguished death,	Speaker1

Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	152.64	157.18	roses, mangoes, magical birds and their songs all in the same place.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	157.92	164.98	The world is a pregnant woman, afternoon walk down a palm shaded seaside road, the wind whipping ((white)) across the hissing sea.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	165.2	166.44	Taking it easy.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	166.81	169.677	Taking it easy with my man by my side,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	169.985	172.135	how much longer do I got to wait.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	174.07	176.224	The world is ants in your sugar	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	176.424	177.92	((and)) flies in your beer.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	178.32	181.49	It's mosquitos, sunburn, and stomachaches	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	181.84	185.29	and bulldozers smashing down ((on)) audibly screaming trees,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	185.51	187.62	to make houses, to make paper,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	187.78	192.631	to flash ideas across an imaginary entity spinning through cloudy space.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	193.71	195.15	The world's a newspaper	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	195.3	196.889	printed in technicolor.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	198.429	199.607	You better believe it.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	200.36	202.71	You didn't make it but love it or leave it.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	204.66	205.73	The world's a ripoff.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	206.137	207.026	Burn.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	207.48	210.33	All your dreams come true and nightmares too.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	211.11	212.395	It's a pretty good joke	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	212.489	213.624	and it's on you.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	214.51	220.069	So ((hats off,)) if you don't forget to laugh at yourself even if you got to laugh to keep from crying.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	221.572	223.23	It's a pretentious project.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	223.62	224.91	A beautiful blunder.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	225.49	226.883	A terrible mistake.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	228.14	232.632	It's watched over by avenging angels who drink too much and lots of times	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	232.907	234.667	come to work in a bad mood.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	236.188	237.376	((It's)) a police state.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	238.23	244.12	Habeas corpus has been suspended and the court of appeals has a backlog six centuries too long.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	244.635	245.572	But don't worry	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	246.545	247.883	because it's your mama	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	248.29	249.896	giving you a pat on the head	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	250.54	251.75	and a big kiss.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	252.358	253.188	It's sugar.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	253.827	254.94	It's ((the best.))	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	256.0	257.337	It's satisfaction,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	257.99	259.281	anticipation,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	259.902	260.847	fulfillment,	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	261.254	262.134	and rest.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	263.91	265.46	And I think I'll take a little rest.	Speaker1	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	265.292	266.058	Okay.	Speaker2	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	266.754	268.72	Before we continue I just want to read a poem I wrote,	Speaker2	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	269.17	270.69	and I think it's very apropos,	Speaker2

Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	277.17	278.027	{laugh}	Speaker2	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	278.5	285.41	Sometimes I'm afraid to read a poem I've written or let others read it for fear they'll slap a tag on my forehead, tout suite.	Speaker2	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	285.549	288.863	It will glow neon and blink her poetry is just like ((blank's.))	Speaker2	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	289.078	290.24	I wouldn't like that.	Speaker2	
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	290.499	294.55	((Or)) someone had written that poem in their lifetime so I can't in mine.	Speaker2
