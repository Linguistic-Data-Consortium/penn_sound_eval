Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	0.23	5.67	Feels like home to me. I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	6.097	7.44	Can everybody hear me alright?	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	8.02	8.444	Okay.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	9.05	9.506	um	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	9.71	18.23	I'm going to read in two parts. I'm going to read first from the new book lost parkour psalms and then I'm going to read some new amulet sonnets.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	19.71	20.637	So	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	21.239	27.35	um this book, lost parkour psalms, is= is just out in France and it's a dual edition	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	28.007	32.7	in French and in English. Th- th- # separate books but out at the same time	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	33.531	38.181	and in the title ps- psalms, within psalms, alms	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	38.436	39.587	is in parentheses.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	40.327	44.47	And about parkour I just wanted to say that it's an activity	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	44.72	47.42	or a practice of moving rapidly	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	47.58	53.217	usually+ through an urban setting as would a stunt person be moving	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	53.439	58.11	and so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	58.252	59.59	involved in	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	59.972	61.833	contemplative practice	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	62.094	62.598	and	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	62.884	64.61	just considering the psalm	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	64.759	66.24	as a poetic form.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	71.55	75.462	So beginning with a epigram from Joanne Kyger.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	76.763	77.636	The place	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	77.869	78.966	we are going	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	79.45	81.006	is the place we were	Speaker1

Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	94.512	96.29	and not complain	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	96.88	98.08	what is sung	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	98.87	100.785	Do this without assault.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	101.146	102.42	Therefore exist	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	102.567	103.451	everywhere.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	104.84	106.538	I will make a character	Speaker1

Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	214.735	218.354	We stand or recline to incite them.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	218.501	223.34	Obligatory murmuring or rushing words are as nonsensical as	Speaker1

Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	279.07	283.756	Where you are incessantly going is a type of insistence.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	283.962	285.838	An invisible leaning.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	286.37	289.51	You walk this way because your legs carry you.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	290.13	293.32	You allow yourself to expire because each morning	Speaker1

Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	305.33	307.99	is also a sudden barricade	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	308.18	309.61	from accomplishment.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	310.53	314.326	In cities as elsewhere we live only so long.	Speaker1
