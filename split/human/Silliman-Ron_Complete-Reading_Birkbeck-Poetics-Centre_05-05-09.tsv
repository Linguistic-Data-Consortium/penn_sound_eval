Two weights, twin twenty five pound barbells resting on the rug, implicit challenge. The roses have grown wild in the corners, rising high over the wire fence. This compost a small mountain out of whose sides weeds arise. Steam wisps over the lip of the cup. Hot tea at the brink of a hot day. It's summertime.

Salt ring stain circles the shirt. In ((our)) private life, the old actress, now senile, was a surrealist. We pick our way through the cobwebbed residue of her home. Shower steam fogs my glasses. Lift the dead tree stump back into the back of the truck. Quickly the fireworks settle into a terrible sameness the way a swarm of connotations settles in, once you know what it's supposed to mean. In the dream, where do I find it	Subject
