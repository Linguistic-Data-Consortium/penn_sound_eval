DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	0.55	13.026	The ((beats)) were almost always serious too, I remember. That got me into the literary quarterlies and through the (()) writer's workshop and helped me understand my own dark corners and sharp angles and then one day I realized how much of what I was reading and often admiring	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	13.35	20.895	going on around me in the poetry world was a kind of picking of scabs and flashing the open sores and wounds as badges and credentials	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	21.25	25.334	and how O'Hara totally sidestepped that contemporary tendency by tone	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	25.81	31.507	and choice of vocabulary that cut through the hopelessness of so much poetry and replaced it with the joy of writing a poem.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	32.07	33.97	What a simple but wonderful revelation,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	35.02	36.775	the joy of writing it down.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	37.481	38.21	That was what	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	38.86	46.154	(()) # that was what it suddenly seemed to be about, in a way that made me think of all I had heard the painters of his time were trying to do, get across the action of the	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	46.182	52.194	creating rather than the product that was so finished it showed no signs of the activity, the energy and spirit of the actual work	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	52.515	53.297	that went into it.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	53.77	57.108	O'Hara's poems were little excursions into the act of writing poems	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	57.54	61.485	with the kind of mindset that keeps us trying sex with strangers again and again.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	62.0	63.76	The hope that this time is going to be great,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	64.64	65.908	give us much pleasure,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	66.175	74.042	and satisfy a lot of frustration and totally annul the boring, horrible, deadening, killing in fact, effects of living the modern urban existence.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	75.808	77.637	I think I rewrote that phrase.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	78.4	86.02	But I still couldn't reconcile that achievement with the personal references, though they were becoming more and more familiar and thus less and less elitist, though still somewhat obscure.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	86.45	92.808	And one day I was teaching contemporary poetry to a college class and talking about a poem of O'Hara's, I think it was a step away from them.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	93.01	100.32	After talking about the poem Steps and how it overcame the sadness of love's ending or going sour amid the big city grind and in discussing how it did this	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	100.521	107.48	((mostly)) ((through)) the structure of the poem because by then I'd learned so much about movement and rhythm and construction I could see how well made O'Hara's poems are despite	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	107.81	116.305	or maybe because of their conversational flow, and in the process of explaining why the poems were good from a strategic and structural point of view because they accomplished this message of hope	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	116.68	123.834	in the face of contemporary despair and despite well-founded reasons for lamenting our condition or his condition in the specific circumstances of the poem	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	124.16	137.404	and did it through technical agility so refined the surface ambience of ease and a kind of glib grace was hardly disturbed, suddenly I caught myself starting to cry, and I never cried back then, in fact except for a short interlude of about a year of weepiness I never cried period	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	137.78	148.39	except over old movies or musicals and it was that heartstring O'Hara had suddenly plucked in me through his poetry that sang so naturally and yet skillfully of overcoming stupidity and tediousness of so much of life.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	149.72	162.728	The true romantic, only without the pretentious and really elitist self-conscious and self-satisfied seriousness of the walking ((wounds)) of contemporary poetry because by mocking the tone of the real and original romantics partly through the use of quotation marks and italics,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	163.17	168.727	which is a sort of what ((campy)) dialogue often depends on, as others have pointed out it means talking in italics	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	169.37	177.245	and exclamation points and exclamations. Oh, he was making himself vulnerable to a (()) scalpel unlike the confessional poets and others of his contemporaries.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	177.48	184.477	Even the seemingly honest beats who always exposed themselves in ways that demanded applause or appreciation for the courage of the exposure	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	184.484	187.91	or the extent of self-destruction the exposure caused ((or)) exposed,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	189.3	204.087	et cetera. But not O'Hara, his defenses were the shrewdest and toughest of all because they weren't defensive at all but appeared to be all offensive, only the offensive was mounted against his own and others' defensiveness, thus he could be attacked for ((elitism)) when he's in fact he's our most democratic poet since Whitman.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	204.75	214.85	bringing that tradition full circle by reversing Whitman's posing as the common man brother to all which reduced everyone to the level of anonymity that Whitman's poems ensured would never really be his fate, so he could afford it.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	215.497	223.464	I'm talking about the ((pose)) which perhaps became a reality much the way Ginsberg seems to have which is not the poetry because Whitman's poetry is often wonderful and amazing	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	223.68	231.339	and very much more the source of much that is associated with O'Hara and the New York school than many of the French writers constantly attributed with having influenced the New York scene.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	231.94	247.748	Although O'Hara is also sort of a Baude- # Baudelairean reverse making the most of the worst of Baudelaire's pessimistic predictions about urban existence by preserving the best of perceptions and emotionalisms the city scene can generate, but instead O'Hara elevates everyone to the level and attentive familiarity of stars,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	248.18	254.748	throwing in the names of personal friends alongside those of personal heroes and famous and world-renowned producers and creators of the culture	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	254.99	261.354	that has come to be ours and which he defined before most of us and with the clarity of the lyrics of a Hollywood musical or a Madison Avenue add.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	261.74	266.144	Yet with all the subtlety and imaginative exuberance of a great wit and passionate lover.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	266.63	269.35	((What)) an incredibly seductive combination for a poet.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	269.79	270.867	((His)) poems are sexy.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	271.41	283.407	The language is often intimate, the images voluptuous and often exotic, the energy seemingly endless to the point usually reassuring and flattering with just enough ((elusive)) connections to make us want to put out the time and energy to make ourselves as attractively intelligent	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	283.63	287.161	and perceptive and experienced and in the know as the poems assume we are.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	288.2	290.964	He refused to accept an audience that was not as good as he was	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	291.038	298.97	and in that way included us all in the community of friends he admired and addressed and referred to along with the proper names and familiar rhythms of the most ordinary people and things	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	299.93	307.977	all of which he incorporated into descriptions and narratives that included the proper names ((and)) rhythms of the most extraordinary things the rest of us are only now (()) after the poems were written=	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	308.014	308.577	written,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	308.767	312.962	getting hip to and how well they fit and work and complete the artistry of O'Hara's genius.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	313.71	323.13	He helped me realize that the reason I wrote poems was often simply because the rush, the feeling that accompanied the writing of the poem, especially when it seemed to be coming out good, couldn't be duplicated anywhere else.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	323.52	332.868	It wasn't a substitute for anything else, going to bed with someone beautiful and tough, or eating a delicious and totally satisfying meal, or outwitting a horribly abusive competitive creep ((in a)) conversation.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	333.23	342.938	and it wasn't a grueling act of anguish and pain, getting in touch with all the ((crabbed)) secrets of the psyche and exposing to them to the well-organized and systematic scrutiny of some poetic form or strategy, ((no))
