Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	22.324	30.308	what I wanted to do more than anything else was to get poems shorter and shorter and shorter and then I discovered I was too successful. I stopped writing completely.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	31.047	31.778	Ach	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	33.007	35.374	And silence was great, but I wasn't happy with it.	Subject

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	58.23	63.662	Those of you who know me at all know that one of the overwhelming interests of my life is fairy tales	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	64.935	74.353	and for many years, I tried to turn my favorite horrific fairy tale, which is called the Juniper Tree into verse, I was totally unsuccessful at doing this	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	75.126	79.868	And I've ended up doing a b- # a= a fairy from an altogether different tradition	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	80.452	84.32	I'm happy that I have some Japanese friends in the audience tonight	Subject

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	96.459	98.159	I don't know whether any of you here	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	98.627	99.295	know it	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	99.763	101.304	or many of you here know it	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	102.04	104.661	but it is a poem which always deeply moved me.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	105.438	108.369	Once many years ago, I was set to learning Japanese	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	110.177	114.979	under the auspices of the United States Navy, as a matter of fact, and the only thing I read	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	115.476	121.581	of all the material that we went through in the process of learning Japanese that ever stayed in my head was this story.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	122.627	133.816	I could still hear it going in my head for instance The noise that the peach out of which the little boy comes makes as it turns over and over in the river, donburi, donburi, donburi.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	134.671	143.328	I can hear the boy's mother talking to him as she loads him up with kibi dango millet seed cakes, the best kibi dango in all Japan,	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	143.932	146.013	and I can hear the animals who stopped him,	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	146.44	152.816	I've forgotten all the military Japanese I ever knew. I can't tell you the word for a battleship or a gun	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	153.174	164.261	or an ((emplacement)) or anything else but I can t- # probably tell you this story in Japanese though all the rest of it is departed from me. And I'd wanted to work it and rework it, and I've tried=	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	164.67	166.335	tried to find a form for it.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	166.885	175.242	And it finally occurred to me as I under- # with this ((sic-)) # you see it's= a= it's a long # it's only one poem I'm going to read so I have an excuse for a long introduction, right?	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	175.624	183.337	uh As I thought about the ((uh)) appropriate form for this poem, I decided I would return to a very ancient and honorable form, very flexible	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	183.748	185.588	and very beautiful doggerel	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	186.549	194.876	This is a poem which is written in doggerel. I dearly love a rhyme, I'll do anything in the world for a rhyme and I don't much care how fast or how slow	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	195.679	197.527	I get to it in the line.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	198.529	202.858	The interesting thing which happened to this story which originally had a happy ending	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	203.748	212.917	Peach Boy goes out and he goes to the Onigashima, the island of the devils, and he conquers the king of the demons, devils, whatever you call them, monsters	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	213.407	224.554	and he comes back home makes his family happy and he lives happily ever after. But as I wrote this poem, I discovered that the ending of it insisted on changing and I couldn't finish it until I changed the ending	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	225.987	234.36	And this finally turned out then to be a poem not only about what I always thought it was about, which is the impossibility of finding a proper name for everything,	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	234.89	237.028	anything, this is a poem about naming.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	237.556	240.539	But it also turned out to be a poem about heroism,	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	241.127	243.48	an antiheroic poem	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	244.17	253.0	And I suppose the reason it became an antiheroic poem is because the language which I learned reading the story of the little Peach Boy, I ended up using on the island of Iwo Jima	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	254.093	265.501	and too many bad connotations are connected with it. Anyhow, I think all children always know that the so called happy endings of fairy tales are lies.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	266.603	267.125	Right?	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	268.316	280.499	But they understand that we're courteous enough to lie to them and pretend that we think they believe in us when we tell them that everybody lived happily ever after. You'll see nobody lives happily ever after in this.	Subject	
Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	282.284	290.689	((It's)) divided into sections which are the parts of the story. The first part of Momotaro or the Peach Boy then is called The Finding of the Peach	Subject

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	312.115	317.766	But the name of the sum of them all was Pain for they had borne no child to bear their name	Subject

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	377.587	379.51	since cutting was his trade	Subject
