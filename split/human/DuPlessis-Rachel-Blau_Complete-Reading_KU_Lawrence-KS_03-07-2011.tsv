DuPlessis-Rachel-Blau_Complete-Reading_KU_Lawrence-KS_03-07-2011	253.966	259.518	as it would have had to be. And darker the movement, stair to stair	Subject

DuPlessis-Rachel-Blau_Complete-Reading_KU_Lawrence-KS_03-07-2011	278.904	287.287	Though this was hard to fathom when I felt the red shadow of our bloodied world's insistent presence in the moon's eclipse	Subject
