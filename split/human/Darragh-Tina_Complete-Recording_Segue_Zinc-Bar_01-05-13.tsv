Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	1.37	6.34	rings the doorbell at ((gene our nation)) to discuss the results with a genetic counselor.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	6.67	11.73	When the door opens, she's surprised to find a room full of people dressed as crime scene investigators.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	12.14	15.78	A young woman in a white jumpsuit with her forehead tattooed	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	15.91	17.53	I dream of genies	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	17.79	19.475	skateboards over to her.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	19.622	21.51	Just imagine the skateboard, okay.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	22.228	24.661	{laugh}	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	24.608	31.9	Welcome, I'm (()) are you here for your ((burqa)) # welcome, I'm (()) are you here for your ((burqa)) test result?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	27.185	28.298	Oh, m- microphone.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	32.09	36.284	Yes, I'm= I'm Liberty+ and my doctor called to say that it was ready.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	36.705	44.28	Unfortunately we just received a court order restraining us from releasing ((burqa)) results until the test patent dispute is resolved.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	44.49	46.018	But I have good news for you	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	46.31	54.86	So you wouldn't have to come here for nothing we ran an additional test at no extra charge and you don't have any mutations in your human rights gene.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	56.546	62.99	((Gal)) was spinning around and um doing a high five. {laugh} Did= you= did you say human rights?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	63.35	66.59	That's a political doctrine, not a medical condition.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	67.485	69.64	That's so twentieth century.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	70.19	74.198	The new scanners we have can recognize inherent dignity.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	75.41	76.9	Lib thinks Gal is joking.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	77.08	80.59	And the gene for evil has a little black mustache?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	81.882	87.808	Hm. There are tons of mutations for the human rights gene. There may be one for scratchy facial hair.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	88.99	97.99	Lib eggs her on. So um let's say I take a direct hit from the big scratch. I- I won't be so bad because you've got my back with your skateboard.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	98.88	99.647	iPod.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	99.765	101.327	iPod. {laugh}	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	101.79	109.454	Here at ((gene our nation)) we pride ourselves at being the soul of wit, so hanging out with horror can be experienced as good times.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	110.45	111.65	Lib, no longer	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	112.26	112.951	laughing.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	113.265	114.405	Let me get this straight.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	115.31	116.661	If I think evil	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	116.97	119.364	is all taken care of with the genetic test	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	119.74	126.93	I won't notice that I can be incarcerated for an indefinite period of time without a lawyer, secretly flown to another country and tortured?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	128.21	134.4	Well, if you travel to a developing country, we do recommend keeping this test result with your passport.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	135.668	137.69	But I'm without human rights here in America.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	138.24	141.55	I can be picked up today as I leave this building and never be seen again.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	142.24	143.443	No way.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	143.259	144.271	Yes way.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	145.033	149.62	Liberty+ pulls a uh Washington Post news article from her pocket and hands it to Gal.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	150.04	152.68	I carry this with me at all times to remind me	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	152.81	154.67	of all the rights I don't have.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	156.07	162.137	Something as serious as the indefinite detention of citizens becoming law was on page	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	162.227	164.948	~A six instead of on the front page?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	165.65	168.07	Well, at least it wasn't in the style section.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	169.74	175.6	Well, let's hope that the clinical trials for the human rights mutation drugs are successful ~A ~S ~A ~P.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	176.06	177.36	Clinical trials?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	178.15	186.224	Yep. The pharmaceutical companies are all over this one. They need to get some new drugs in the pipeline because their top money makers are going generic.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	186.56	192.95	Don't worry, the National Institutes of Health scientists are making sure the trials are the creme de la creme of research.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	194.11	196.04	Lib has an a ha moment.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	196.707	197.447	So,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	198.13	199.96	~U ~S taxpayers are funding this?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	200.625	201.3	Right.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	201.977	203.042	Terrific.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	203.44	210.008	By law, publicly funded clinical trial participants must be given standard of care for whatever is being tested, so	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	210.214	211.413	for a human rights drug	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	211.61	213.8	that means they get universal healthcare.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	214.139	215.012	Then	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	215.26	216.565	when the trials are completed	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	216.632	218.963	we'll use the march in rights of the Bayh-Dole act	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	219.068	221.079	to get the money to restructure our health system.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	221.99	225.102	Bayh-Dole? Is that some sort of welfare scam?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	225.74	227.06	Yeah, you could say that.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	227.252	228.349	For the drug companies.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	228.56	237.355	The government gives our money to researchers to test and patent drugs. Then the pharmaceutical companies license them and make billions of dollars on our dime,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	237.531	237.918	but	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	238.42	242.504	there's a little known clause in the law that says if the public safety is at risk	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	242.645	245.772	the government can march in and take back the patents.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	245.97	247.65	Deepening her voice {NSV}	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	248.065	250.632	universal healthcare for the public safety.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	251.46	254.774	It will be so cool when health is finally a human right.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	255.087	256.024	Well,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	256.234	258.907	health isn't a right, it's something we do.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	259.01	260.69	If we think of health as a right	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	260.83	265.93	then it's something we're owed which by definition means it's something someone else has.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	266.601	270.476	In this case that would be the healthcare corporations and big pharma, we don't want that.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	270.598	274.895	But we can take back our healthcare system and rebuild it as a cooperative enterprise	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	274.948	278.107	with the profits from the patents ((on)) taxpayer funded research.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	279.07	282.77	Now this will really be fun to do when we march in, can I have my iPod?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	282.656	286.857	{laugh} You bet, we'll all be on a roll. {laugh}	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	291.935	296.51	Okay, and the um # alright, so the final one um Erica will do with me, it's called	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	296.75	298.33	a hon by any other name	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	298.659	299.692	and it um	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	299.82	301.74	# there's a little handout that goes with it.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	302.27	304.609	uh {laugh} (())	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	305.21	308.87	{laugh} Right. F- # because there's a sing-along at the end.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	309.286	309.967	{laugh}	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	316.03	319.617	Okay, a hon by any other name. (()) and (())	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	320.021	324.66	best buds since attending fourth grade together, Patapsco Elementary School in Baltimore,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	324.91	326.232	are down in the dumps.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	326.769	331.066	Their usual plans for attending a street festival celebrating hons,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	331.43	337.18	working class women from Baltimore, usually depicted with beehive hairdos and leopard skin capri pants,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	337.333	338.249	are on hold	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	338.44	340.61	after hearing that the festival's organizer	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	340.8	342.68	has trademarked the expression hon.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	343.302	344.138	Dismayed,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	344.31	345.98	they wander into a coffee shop.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	346.928	347.518	(())	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	348.22	351.72	I'm so upset by this hon business because it reminds me of work.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	352.43	353.849	What's our brand.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	353.96	355.91	What does this do to our brand?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	356.15	361.394	Get your brand on. My brand was an honor student at Patapsco Elementary School. Donuts for brand equity.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	361.434	367.457	What would brand do? I made my money the old fashioned way, I branded it. I never met a brand I didn't.	Speaker1
