Call it Spring. Call me later. Make up the bed in the back room while they're staying.

The book watches me read again and again and tells everyone what I think about it. Nothing much. The grain was matted with blood. Houses everywhere. A crushed rock clogged their mouths, gaping open. Lips like mashed potatoes. Blood red sunset again streaked with success. The campaign was almost over. Who would ever	Subject

Drucker-Johanna_Complete-reading_Weds-at-four-plus_Buffalo_10-23-02	174.536	236.139	Young and thin in a machine made dress that could not adapt itself to her limbs, equally awkward. The stiff, cheap, white cloth and the pale knock kneed legs, limited in their range of movement by her inexperience of herself in the world. Fresh as a fucking flower, she stood there. Her hundred and eighty dollar shirt thin and delicate as those emulsions. Film she fetishizes floats off their paper back. With tiny tweezers I make delicate compositions. Petal by small petal since when I was a child. I love nature, natural forms. I used to collect the cuttings that fell from my father's hand. My father he was a botanist, a professor and a gardener. And all this time her bare legs, thin and mottled, balanced precariously. Even thin as she was of the near invisible but very, very pointed anxiously high heeled sandals, her long blonde hair, curled, who does that now, to line her shoulders, shining like her eyes. And thank you to all the women who supported this exhibition. The brave women, their courageous act of  underwriting.	Subject

Drucker-Johanna_Complete-reading_Weds-at-four-plus_Buffalo_10-23-02	250.342	302.245	She went all over the world, weeping histrionically, tears on my pillow, far from home. Her lean militant form arched against the bleached s- s- stones of the pilgrimage site in Tunisia, while her head drooped with the weight of unrequited martyrdom. Her tall limbs charged with faith strode along the road to Canterbury, leaving the group of otherwise jovial companions on the road, in Rome and Rouen, ((short and on mien)) on the path to remoter sites along the Black Sea and into the sacred places of the Eastern Church. At eighteen she was pale, fierce, erect, prouder at twenty two. At thirty an iron maiden, resolute and commanding. At thirty seven, an intimidating force. At sixty, severe and twisted. They snuck away from her one morning, tired of her haranguing speech and her love of God endlessly ruining their mealtime chatter.	Subject
