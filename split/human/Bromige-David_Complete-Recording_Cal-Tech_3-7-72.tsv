Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	1.73	3.984	I thought to go to Chicago right away	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	4.115	5.261	and suddenly,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	5.643	6.762	inexplicably,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	7.053	8.359	my will failed me.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	9.63	13.91	Was it that I'd gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months?	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	14.1	15.51	That I needed no one else?	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	16.68	19.77	An older woman, a second cousin, took me in hand,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	20.41	25.74	but I was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	26.17	27.801	Whatever our ((bodies)) were up to.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	29.55	36.001	Meanwhile, I kept a close watch on that ladder activity, thinking how now I would be able to satisfy Hilda when next we met.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	36.65	39.205	The knowledge, however acquired, is power.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	41.77	44.72	I must confess my feelings towards Hilda were not unmixed.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	44.97	47.069	At times I would decide to banish her	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	47.66	49.27	((for)) she deserved nothing else.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	50.04	54.57	But then I would see that she was already banished, and that I would have to think of something else.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	58.512	64.02	Well, the first thing I had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	64.735	65.939	That's another story.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	66.63	70.07	A story all in itself and one, really, very much like this.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	70.71	72.343	So I don't have to tell it here.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	79.32	80.63	A year had passed	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	80.8	85.199	and Hilda had grown some four or five inches so that she was now six feet tall.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	86.52	91.351	Her wrists, which had been ((long)) with a kind of vulnerability I found very attractive,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	91.536	92.569	were now bony	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	92.81	94.426	as though she'd been hung from a beam.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	96.0	99.776	Her face, deprived of its previous bloom, was long and sallow.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	100.03	101.576	In short, I thought her ugly.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	102.55	105.88	Pitifully so, although when she spoke the voice was the same	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	106.03	108.458	and I was glad to feel the pain of that survival.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	110.053	114.195	Her place was by no means the palace she had caused me to infer she came from.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	114.77	117.332	I had to spend the night on a couch in the living room	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	117.83	122.469	but by now I knew this kind of evasion of the realities of one's circumstance was widespread	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	122.872	125.04	and I'd even begun to slip into it myself.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	128.72	131.46	Next day when her parents were at work, Hilda,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	131.645	134.53	who had taken the morning off, sat with me in the kitchen	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	135.13	138.08	while her boyfriend raced his motorbike up and down the block,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	138.62	141.403	looking up at the window from time to time, sneakily.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	141.66	144.125	I caught his glance once when I was looking down.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	145.495	147.032	How Hilda must have felt.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	148.02	151.72	She had returned to a different perspective, and now here I was,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	152.15	155.7	the living proof of a will she wouldn't be likely to meet many more times	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	156.16	157.991	in the corner she had settled for.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	158.86	161.74	For it was clear to me now that all was over between us.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	162.775	164.18	Listening to her talk	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	164.58	167.9	I began to despise the person I had been the year before.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	169.36	171.25	Still, I had the will to stay,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	171.47	175.46	but the will to leave under those circumstances offered more possibilities	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	175.78	178.069	and so I bowed gracefully to the inevitable.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	180.3	183.31	When I got up to go, tears did come to her eyes.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	183.765	185.514	That moment I remember still	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	186.73	193.195	and I recognized immediately a feeling to be stored up against the ease, if not the indifference, of times to come.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	194.02	195.592	Many times in the future	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	196.05	199.386	I was to conjure that farewell when I was filled with despair	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	199.98	202.23	and often it sufficed to tip the balance	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	202.57	206.51	so that it could be thought to have caused several destructive rages over the years.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	207.98	209.998	But it's all water under the bridge now.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	210.82	212.707	Hardly worth the trouble of telling	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	213.03	216.22	and it's past time already to think that I have told it poorly	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	216.6	218.377	and to see that, like it or not,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	218.837	220.923	there's nothing I can do about that either.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	222.63	224.68	Yes, it might have all been otherwise	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	225.12	229.352	and yet for what it has to say about the human will in one of its manifestations,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	229.737	232.002	I wouldn't change one moment of the misery.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	232.44	235.278	For an easier way is not necessarily a better.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	236.51	239.95	and I believe I can speak not only for myself, but for Hilda,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	240.7	243.03	who found out what it was like to meet her match.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	243.43	245.01	A man who scorned to take	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	245.17	247.279	either no or yes for an answer.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	253.42	254.207	((Okay.))	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	260.893	265.3	Now th- these are a series of short pieces with a general title of tight corners	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	267.349	267.757	{cough}	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	273.114	275.926	Have I been reading about twenty five minutes? Feels like it.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	276.367	277.128	What's the time?	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	279.337	280.146	Yeah I have	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	280.54	283.093	Okay. I'll= read= I'll read for about ten minutes more.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	291.7	295.62	The boy, elbows bent, supports himself with his hands.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	296.18	297.452	His body prone	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	298.12	302.58	so that his face may approach the surface of this small pond from which he drinks.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	303.782	305.624	At his back the lane goes on	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	305.93	307.305	and the sheep go with it.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	307.87	311.053	The black dog at their back, possibly a reminder of the artist	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	311.861	312.978	or one's self.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	314.06	317.699	Further on, one wants to say, though in another sense it's higher up,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	318.39	321.849	the lane crooks out of the shade and finds an open meadow	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	322.58	325.85	from where there must be a better view of that squat church tower.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	327.2	328.335	But the clouds,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	329.25	331.119	the clouds are more surely the point.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	331.89	334.339	Such clouds as are no longer to be seen.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	335.293	338.026	A rhythm of contraction would pull one in,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	338.32	339.82	deeper into itself,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	340.38	342.23	before that open space.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	342.62	343.968	Meadow and sky	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	344.564	345.8	is granted one.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	352.71	355.495	These are very loosely sequential and uh it's=	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	357.65	360.046	it's happiest for me if I just uh make up	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	360.49	362.278	a different way through it each time.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	362.885	363.475	So.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	365.13	367.924	The pause is only while ((the eye selects)) something to do.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	368.64	371.262	While they watch the cat, while they watch (({laugh}))	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	371.61	374.94	While they watch, the cat stalks up the path to the front door,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	375.7	378.43	raises itself by putting its front paws	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	378.64	380.832	as high as it can reach against the door	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	381.24	383.561	and then, resting on its left forefoot,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	384.17	388.711	it raises its right so that the knocker is moved out until the arc of the paw	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	388.96	390.95	falls below the arc the knocker makes	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	391.28	394.829	and thus the knocker falls back against the metal inset in the door	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	395.37	396.57	and as they watch,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	396.69	397.93	the door opens	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	398.118	399.55	and the cat slips in	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	399.86	401.65	as a woman's face appears	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	402.055	403.329	peering into the street.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	414.74	418.07	The two men have been walking for a long time, one thinks	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	418.6	420.286	though perhaps no more than an hour.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	421.07	427.093	It's now becoming obvious that he has chosen the less traveled of two highways out of town in the direction he and his friend want to go.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	428.351	430.3	His friend was right, and he was wrong.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	431.3	435.49	They resolve to take the cutoff they are now approaching, and to walk its length,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	435.94	437.7	if no farm truck comes along,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	438.09	439.651	until the other highway is reached.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	440.36	441.809	The heat is considerable.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	442.02	443.567	It is early afternoon.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	443.98	447.481	On either hand huge fields of wheat find no wind to stir them.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	448.52	450.601	The only food they have is a chocolate bar.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	451.51	455.193	The time comes to eat it, and one unslings the pack and they take it out.	Speaker1
