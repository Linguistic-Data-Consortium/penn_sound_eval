PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	0.644	4.069	You expect to be instructed by instructions and um	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	4.723	15.846	you don't get very instructed by them, you know? And they're very French in the sense that you know, it's just sort of kind of like French theory. You're like reading along and you go, What? {laugh} You know? {laugh} Can you run that by me again?	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	11.111	12.697	{laugh}	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	13.701	14.38	Ha ha.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	14.916	15.525	Ha.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	16.311	16.907	um	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	17.64	21.691	and I liked the way the wit- # this quote was um	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	22.123	28.038	similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry in= in math	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	28.562	42.357	i- # a= a symmetrical equation, i- it's the same in both directions. You go though all of these procedures and it's the same, so nothing actually happens and but all this stuff happens. And so you start out with the same thing at either end and um	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	42.78	48.941	a- and I= I was interested in that idea. So it's a kind of i- # it's a kind of stasis and then symmetry is a kind of stasis	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	49.048	49.63	Hm.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	49.346	50.668	and um	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	51.433	57.915	((uh)) but it's= a= it's a kind of quivery stasis that isn't really stasis because it just then it sort of collapses and then you have a kind of	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	58.247	68.07	anti stasis. So this= this quote seemed to do that for me uh in a way that it was interesting and the only thing that I think that you take from it	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	68.42	77.852	is a sense of symmetricality and that persistence in the situation. And that relates to my reading of David, which is to say you just have to stare into it and persist.	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	77.966	78.485	Mhm.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	78.229	91.17	uh So I was just interested in evoking that. It doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote, it seems anti explanatory. And yet it seems kind of to have an uh nuance to # er i- # you know, numinous quality to it I liked	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	84.833	85.484	((Yeah.))	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	93.394	100.5	That was very clear ((in= in so many points to just said,)) that paragraph. Yeah, I'm taking notes. Now that's	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	96.545	101.552	{laugh}	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	100.701	102.37	That's wonderful. So	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	103.117	108.899	So= uh so things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	109.689	118.425	Well, ye- # i- if asymmetry as you point out, symmetry and not symmetry are the same. So an asymmetry ass- assumes lack of symmetry and so you know	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	114.277	116.133	They ((make up symmetry,)) yeah.	Interviewer

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	119.561	121.791	So how do you ever get to	Interviewer

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	133.804	136.137	so that the fact of change is encompassed	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	136.822	137.757	Think of death	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	137.999	138.505	Yeah.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	138.473	145.968	{laugh} It's changed. I mean there's= there's # somebody in= in # I was just in buffalo and somebody said # asked me a question and it was uh	Subject

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	140.033	140.461	Yeah.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	146.582	154.435	uh, What's your position on change? Do you think change is {laugh} good? Or are you against {laugh} ((change?))	Subject

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	157.246	165.637	and I= I said it just # it # you # ((we)) don't have a choice and uh it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes and uh	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	166.139	176.334	uh and yo- # when= when things are bad you w- # you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change. And when things are good you don't want things to change because things are good and change would be bad.	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	171.593	172.174	Mhm.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	176.737	189.154	But you always want something else, so you want change because you think things are going to get better. Things are not going to get better, and it's amazing that we think that {laugh} they are.	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	178.957	179.379	Mhm.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	183.826	185.729	My book said the same thing. ((It's like #))	Interviewer

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	204.884	210.098	Well that kind of brings up for me the question of this um one might call this social imaginary	Unknown1	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	210.552	214.414	of um using um a counting	Unknown1	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	211.962	212.488	Hm.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	215.595	218.274	system. um For example, David you	Unknown1	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	218.623	224.527	were using ten lines and uh ((you know you're)) inventing this sort of combinatory	Unknown1	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	225.167	234.837	uh twenty poems, ten lines each um ((within)) various combinations. Is there any um # anything that you attached to	Unknown1

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	235.295	242.746	of um # some of larger social import to the use of that sort of counting structure, other than merely as= a=	Unknown1	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	243.175	245.022	as a means ((to an ending to you?))	Unknown1

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	248.568	250.599	Everyone in this culture counts the same.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	250.984	253.739	So # I mean we're agreed on ten then twenty	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	254.247	256.274	and how you get there	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	256.726	257.447	you know.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	258.145	258.775	So=	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	259.368	260.989	uh so because {NSV} #	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	261.923	263.25	{NSV}	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	263.743	267.788	well it's hard to single one book out but certainly this book	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	268.535	270.914	was concerned with epistemology	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	271.342	273.263	and {breath} how	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	274.064	281.223	when the words never mean exactly the same thing for any one of us as ((uh nonetheless)) of society is possible	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	281.581	287.128	((whereas)) I was looking for things like # i was thinking of things like teaching children to read, teaching children to count	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	287.907	290.323	and how that is there as some kind of	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	291.171	296.995	outside to each one of us, although it's inside us you know. That's why it's outside there. It's inside us here	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	298.408	300.616	{lipsmack} And uh I could say more about that but	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	302.024	305.523	seems more useful to keep responses to like a paragraph	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	306.131	321.1	When you said, Everyone counts the same in this culture I thought, Boy, that's way not true because I thought you meant # {laugh} some of us are more equal than others. {laugh}	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	312.581	314.315	Oh, ((not #)) no, no, no.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	314.884	315.318	No.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	315.7	316.783	No, but they should.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	317.792	318.55	That's right.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	319.225	327.558	And but you see # yeah, but that's ((als-)) # but that's # the= the way you heard that statement is also correct, for this book because there # I believe there's quite a bit about	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	328.192	334.802	social inequity in this book although it's not called by the usual terms. Just that they uh # because they= had= they had ((Lenin.))	Interviewer

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	337.646	338.239	Hm.	Unknown1	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	338.68	339.689	so= uh	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	341.389	343.737	so long engorged ((that)) they are now limp.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	344.422	345.009	So	Interviewer

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	346.593	347.382	{laugh}	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	348.069	376.511	One of the things that I find really fascinating about this whole process um is that it allows um me as a reader to watch each of you as a writer tackling a not exactly parallel but it's the closest thing to it project in= ess- in essentially the same space. Reading the other's work and then constructing something to say out of that process. And I am intrigued that both of you to one degree or another um	Unknown2	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	377.382	389.229	I would say flirt with narrative in um as though it were behind or related to the text. You picking the film that I take it has not ever seen um	Unknown2	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	389.927	391.456	even though you know ((I)) #	Unknown2	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	391.268	398.126	Which is so symmetrical since the filmmaker has also not seen the film that his film was based {laugh} on.	Subject	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	394.383	395.422	((Lots that he #))	Unknown2	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	396.003	396.54	Mhm.	Interviewer	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	396.059	396.682	Right.	Unknown2	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	397.214	420.499	And= and= I= and I think David does that as well, suggesting a= a narrative he never spells out with ((puns)) and merit and symmetries and= and= and n- # and actually never bringing it to the surface, but then he'll ((be)) back to it on= on multiple occasions which actually seems closer to the relationship to your text actually and its= its relationship, ((and)) I'm very intrigued in the kind of parallelism	Unknown2	
PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	405.728	406.333	{lipsmack} Uh-huh.	Interviewer
