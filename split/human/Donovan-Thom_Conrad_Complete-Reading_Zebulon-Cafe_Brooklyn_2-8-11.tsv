Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	232.891	234.536	with my friend ~C ~A Conrad	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	235.735	242.473	Our exercise was based on downtown New York City cellist Arthur Russell's masterpiece, World of Echo.	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	243.37	248.084	It is difficult to describe Russell's World of Echo for anyone who hasn't heard it before	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	248.854	257.421	It has a rare spiritual quality, which issues from Russell's songwriting, voice and cello playing, but also from the production values of the album	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	258.15	267.342	Perhaps the following passage from Tim Lawrence's biography of Russell, Hold Onto Your Dreams makes palpable Russell's subtle, accidental studio processes.	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	269.202	273.875	During these sessions it became standard for Arthur to splice together separate tapes	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	274.424	282.073	and he would regularly grab a track from one tape and fly it into the multitrack of another while his onlooking engineer tried to stay calm	Subject

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	290.133	294.647	It was all very confusing. I could never really tell what we were working on until it was done,	Subject

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	307.814	313.63	At one point, Conrad told me that he used the album to heal a knee injury that he had suffered	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	314.258	325.872	Russell was trained foremost as a musician and only afterwards as a Buddhist. So the healing powers of his music I can only imagine come from the confluence of these two disciplines.	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	327.022	336.341	For our exercise, Conrad and I decided to have Russell's album playing on four different stereos throughout the five story house for a twelve hour duration	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	336.814	342.518	Twelve hours is a long time to do anything, ((and)) especially to listen to an album ((triply)) on repeat.	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	343.65	346.845	Among the constraints I recall imposing on myself,	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	347.3	348.981	many had to do with memory.	Subject

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	357.937	363.161	These exercises in intention and distraction I felt were true to Russell's music	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	363.673	370.225	So was a certain circularity that the exercises were trying to induce amidst interruption and disjunction	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	372.398	379.822	We also spent much of the nine hours improvising lines with a set of books I had brought with me from New York City to Philadelphia	Subject

Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	417.566	422.472	Russell, perhaps more than any other composer I'd come into contact with	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	422.945	434.755	understood the importance of tuning his body and his mind as instruments coeval with his cello and the other instruments, drum machines, guitar, tabla he would use throughout his compositions.	Subject	
Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11	435.519	446.838	Via studio production Russell gave access to the occult and otherworldly in ways similar to Conrad's use of his own body as a source of information and vision	Subject
