Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	149.831	150.685	Weird.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	152.946	158.44	Yet monochromatic war was no longer satire so much as some technophobe totem	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	158.567	163.991	experimenting over the balcony in the gas he goes to call and is stirred by	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	164.39	180.268	but managed somehow to boast anyway, something about a drinking problem or a missing arm or an alien culture but I stopped it there, feeling the terms alien and culture extremely personal and felt the danger, the literal urge in fact to actually say something about	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	180.51	183.473	micromanaged alienation and the experience of	Speaker1

Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	190.208	191.225	society.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	191.629	193.46	Nevertheless this urge	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	193.641	196.581	passed and was lost, was gone, was	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	196.963	198.595	jettisoned, was	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	198.712	201.076	judiciously disearned and	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	201.159	202.262	left out.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	202.66	208.103	The laze of the intervenient chaos locked in on the smiling clenched dust	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	208.196	211.389	revealed to me in that light thus spoke or the	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	211.465	214.961	sound of a footstep which unfolds, which for it	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	215.157	218.973	to be what it is for itself I give up and look up.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	219.98	223.802	This is why the sick child falters in a field of abstraction.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	224.798	227.92	This is why chaos can be so disheartening to those	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	228.11	229.924	who would control their lives.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	230.49	235.26	This is why the stalactites+ must be left in place for the next clumsy oaf.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	236.43	238.008	You are not here.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	238.464	240.93	Heads or tails with ink in it.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	241.97	245.718	Open and or closed in the amused swerving	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	245.82	248.613	al- almost always unable to find	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	248.74	250.604	the underlined passage.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	252.915	254.25	Time did I start?	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	260.735	261.368	((What?))	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	263.45	265.53	Identity as the cause of warts.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	269.115	270.244	I have a toad.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	271.743	273.017	Its name is Boober.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	274.344	275.639	Boober the toad.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	276.401	278.16	Boober raises rabbits.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	279.2	282.697	The rabbits live in a big can named big can.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	284.355	285.92	Mostly they complain.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	286.9	289.77	Boober bangs the lid for them to calm down.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	291.544	292.764	It doesn't work.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	294.06	301.129	At the last annual convening of the International Monetary Fund Boober spoke to a packed house about toad stuff.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	304.88	307.85	He talked it up good and the bankers banged their lids.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	309.971	312.29	Sometimes Boober and me smoke pot.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	315.0	319.512	Other times, usually while banging, Boober has a twi- twitch of sympathy	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	319.71	325.487	but always for himself and he calls the phone and= it= and it says anything so he bangs on it too	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	325.754	332.291	and I feel sorry for it and hang around with all these other things in the room wondering about this banging toad in my life.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	334.21	340.326	Boober gets a by gosh, by golly expression, which on a toad looks like all their other expressions	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	341.89	343.42	but that ((total thing))	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	343.52	346.193	little girl I don't work in no candy kitchen.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	346.78	349.406	(()) I don't sell no chewing gum.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	350.851	353.26	Do any of you folks have toads?	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	354.28	356.934	Can you help me through my toad difficulties?	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	358.06	360.22	Sometimes I lie asleep all night.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	361.517	363.803	I just can't take it anywhere anymore.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	365.291	374.557	Sometimes I think I should get a frog instead but my friend ((Jiggs Casey)) has a frog and he built a nuclear weapon= weapon with it and I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't call me anymore.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	378.784	380.763	You can actually see Boober on the web.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	381.44	382.479	Boober uh	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	383.668	385.049	# Bill (()) did this	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	385.279	386.318	just terrific	Speaker1
