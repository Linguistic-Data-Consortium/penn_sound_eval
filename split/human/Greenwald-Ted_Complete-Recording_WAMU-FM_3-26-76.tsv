Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76	7.983	16.19	I'm not saying that some things don't infuriate me. They certainly do. But I've learned mostly through stupid repetition the same patience I apply to my own works.	Subject	
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76	16.56	31.226	Moving them out of range of good and evil is applicable in a romantic way I guess to things natural and unnatural.

Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76	99.686	115.274	An evening spent talking, spent thinking about what my life would be if I'd stayed with a particular girl or woman I went with, what would be if I'd have been accepted to and gone where I applied to a different school than the one I did, where I'd learn different social graces than the ones I have	Subject

Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76	156.215	208.754	I sense a willingness to tell someone I know and like and sense the same from anything they'd like to know about me and at the same time have a vast sense of privacy, which means there's no way I'll wear out my personality and its sense of continuity, although sometimes I feel empty. But talking to someone I like and trust and sense the same from, I feel way up and after a long evening of talk about this and that, feel wide awake and feel the world wide and awake around me and have a visual intensity and memory that in near memory dulls and throbs and grows vivid as hell. When I bring it to mind some time from then what my life would've been like under different circumstances, ((it)) would've been different with its own attendant ifs and its own what might have been But this way I've elected to follow and cast my vote each waking day in I avoid the possibility of taking the past too seriously or feeling any bitterness or sadness	Subject
