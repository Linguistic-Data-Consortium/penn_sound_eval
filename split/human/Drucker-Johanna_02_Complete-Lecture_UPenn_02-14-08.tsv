Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	0.722	2.263	The pleasures of the flash	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	2.658	20.142	still under celebrated in our culture. They # they've mapped these fears of seduction and pleasure onto the television, the Game Bo- # Boy, the virtual world with its constant gratifications. I mean it's not that there aren't issues with these of things, but there's a kind of sense that, Oh, you know we'll= we'll= we'll put distance in there	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	20.516	29.902	And there's a kind of moral superiority in this critique that supposes that you know we should be didactic, you know we= we should teach people how to not have pleasure, with mass culture.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	30.367	30.998	Why?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	31.394	59.814	You know that- that's not # doesn't get at the systemic issues. It doesn't get at what= is= what is ((a)) problem, here. um So and it takes for granted the idea that ((someone who's intellectual,)) they're outside the culture, they're superior to it right? Artists # art for them is outside the ideologies+, right? Resistance um you know the= the # resistance is our job, you know. We are the moral conscience of the culture, and if you challenge this as I have done on many o- occasions, and I= ha- I have uh something I want to put forward to replace {laugh} resistance.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	60.211	77.226	Resistance, said a critic recently to me when I gave a talk in New York, Resistance will die hard. And he narrowed his eyes as he said it and he hunched up his shoulders in a kind of defensive way. And they were very well fed and very well padded shoulders in a butter soft lamb leather coat.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	77.811	83.885	And I though, Yes, resistance will die hard. Especially among those with career investments in its stock.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	86.621	90.644	So as I was writing this piece, along came a press release from Joy Garnett.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	91.13	96.19	And it came through the email um and it b- # it had in it this brand new painting that she sent	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	96.633	108.815	And I thought, It was so wet, it even looked wet on the screen. It was like you know just sort of wonderful. And the press release said, Joy Garnett continues her exploration of the malleability of instantly globalized images	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	109.316	142.863	um She said she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates. And I thought, Yes, this is so interesting. She's like doing this um you know remediation project and just working with these images and it felt so much to me like the images in my book um of= of real things. Of things ((a)) person's obser- observed or photographs and they're so striking that they sort of stop your day. And I could tell she was having that same experience ((and)) that these things just come out ((during it)) stops her and she thinks, What an amazing image. But to really understand the image, she has to remake it. She has to repaint it	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	143.843	150.742	So, again I know that experience. I sit down. I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	151.452	155.681	So why is that? What is that doing? What= is= Joy= what is Joy doing? um	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	156.052	162.332	She absorbs, I absorb, we process, we remake these things, we experience the images anew	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	162.876	180.645	So they're outside me, this is not outside her. They're grafted, they're scraped from that surface. You know you really kind of # through that physical act of making, you= you interpret something and you somaticize it. It becomes part of you. um And it's a kind of seeing through the hand and seeing through the body that goes along	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	181.834	187.273	So where does Joy Garnett get her idea of what she's doing? I mean, what does she think she's doing? What= what is her idea of making art?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	187.654	205.093	What is it to make you know poetry and text into a book? What does it mean to create ex- # aesthetic expressions? Am I really doing anything different, anything more self conscious than I was when I was sitting there, digging to China? Do I know anything more about making art than I do about mak- # about digging a hole?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	205.551	213.755	I'm not really sure. I think cultural mythology invents itself in us anew, over and over again in each generation	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	215.098	224.367	But let's make a comparison, here. Let's= let's compare Joy Garnett with Damien Hearst, right? I mean, what makes art different from other made things?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	224.701	228.331	How do we know we're looking at art and not just at something else?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	228.983	244.444	You know, here's the consumerist issue. It comes right to the fore, here. You know, this is the high stakes gamble. This is high priced art. This is kitsch, vulgar imagery. You know, this is the investment in branding. For the love of God, right? What God? Mammon? Is this an outrage?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	244.989	276.003	Or is it actually the work that demonstrates the importance of the relationship between capital and art, in order to keep its status? I think this is an important and serious work. and I think it tells us a lot. I don't think you can bracket it out. Quite the contrary. This is the high- # most highly prized work by a contemporary artist, even if he's the person who bought it from himself, in part. The point is that it {laugh} tells us something. Tell us ((to God.)) There's something very, very important about this in terms of how art as a concept is constructing itself culturally.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	276.513	277.63	How about ((Murra Culmney?))	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	278.073	284.898	Another ar- # I love this guy I think this stuff is amazing. Or is he just a product designer? Right, is this art or product?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	285.722	287.105	This is crazed imagery.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	287.524	288.179	Deviant.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	288.735	291.108	But it finds its mark into all kinds of products	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	291.522	296.085	It's a bit, Is this an outrage? Right? Is this art? Is= this= is this commerce?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	296.522	304.889	Or is it the demonstration of the importance of marketing and promotion in the production of not just art but the category or art. Again, what is art that we're doing it?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	306.017	316.545	Or Phil Collins. This is, you know, from the= the video installation, The World Won't Listen. It's a wonderful installati- # it's seductive, it's beautiful. You know, Phil Collins is a Smiths fan	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	316.949	323.608	He set up this project to go to three cities, Bogota, Istanbul, and um Jakarta	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	324.024	333.442	And he gathered fans of the Smiths, all ages. In those cities, he set up karaoke performances and he fil= filmed them	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	333.968	343.966	And then he installed them in this beautiful video installation where you see the three cities simultaneously side by side going through the cuts on the Smiths' album.	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	344.602	347.866	And what do they show you, these wonderful figures?	Subject	
Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	348.27	353.695	They show impossibilities, the impossibility of= of ever becoming what you aspire to	Subject
