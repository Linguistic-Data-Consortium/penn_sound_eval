Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	3.95	5.421	Zeroing in on	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	6.18	8.871	a rhythm of speech that moves from heart to heart.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	9.37	10.69	Zeroing in on	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	10.95	13.4	and in the moment unable to hold onto it.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	13.56	15.62	The suspension, a kind of start,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	16.0	18.575	way classic in its sundry appeal,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	19.13	20.96	that accordion way of life.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	21.3	22.841	People sitting everywhere,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	23.16	25.378	to walk in and see all those people,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	27.328	28.222	not even.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	29.12	34.375	I stumbles and falls, becomes an empty underscore, italicizing nothing.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	35.41	39.09	Hundreds of thousands of email messages, gone forever.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	39.26	41.972	Deeply buried in unwound time.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	42.672	43.545	Flickering,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	43.642	44.814	I'll get right on it.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	44.989	45.851	Get it right	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	45.955	46.604	and	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	46.74	48.4	that's not what I heard.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	50.82	52.23	Reading by hand.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	53.5	55.797	Writing in pencil lasts longer.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	56.38	60.402	Pick something up and try to figure out how it works, say a digital camera.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	60.497	61.578	Consult the manual.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	61.75	64.22	Writing is the same way, reading by hand.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	65.002	66.19	But I'm so lazy.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	66.417	67.429	Don't want to worry.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	67.68	69.04	I stay alone at night.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	69.44	71.056	Writer has one subject.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	71.32	73.281	It is the act of being alone.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	74.315	78.61	The sky is brilliant, huge cumulus clouds mass above the lake.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	79.87	81.53	Writing goes its own way.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	81.961	84.16	You have to supply the synthesis.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	85.73	87.94	Sound of car doors closing.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	89.1	94.9	The sound of car doors closing and voices from the street, an engine starts up, revving to pull away.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	95.07	96.877	Down to the corner and gone.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	97.48	100.44	In the silence that follows, train whistle sounds.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	100.696	101.692	Who listens?	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	102.15	103.94	Then jet noise overhead.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	104.51	106.4	Who stays behind to report?	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	106.756	107.576	And who	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	107.7	109.68	in some other time and place,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	109.88	112.12	quietly waits to hear word	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	113.245	114.075	up front.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	114.97	118.983	Writing in place, the illusion of movement meets the illusion of standing still.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	119.1	121.217	A philosophical encounter with rhythm.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	121.41	124.41	Counting time in a forest of symbols, batter up.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	125.09	130.381	Throwing a few change ups, whatever's working that night, replacing Mark Redman as part of the double switch.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	130.432	131.652	This isn't about me.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	131.79	133.064	This is for you men.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	133.259	134.533	You women out there.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	135.71	137.511	A train comes into the picture.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	138.23	140.592	Picture a group of men walking along beside it.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	141.387	142.02	Later,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	142.28	144.488	Clint drives the train through a saloon.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	145.87	147.602	Jet noise trails away.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	148.262	152.06	Going to great lengths, riding up front on the handlebars.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	153.684	154.44	This train.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	156.1	157.561	Driving that train.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	158.114	159.035	The words	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	159.209	159.746	book.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	160.66	163.798	You stare glassy eyed at the onrushing terrain.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	164.49	166.161	Ain't no more ((cane.))	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	167.29	168.932	The essentials scatter	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	169.33	170.905	all over the parking lot.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	171.75	175.061	The rhythm of the rails. Cows disappear out the window.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	175.369	176.509	You'll never know	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	177.228	178.454	how much I love you.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	178.81	180.836	You'll never know how much I care.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	181.32	184.42	Light winds teasing the upper branches.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	185.16	186.45	The silver rings.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	187.41	189.885	The medium blue topaz spoke to her	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	190.2	193.4	and when she looked more closely, displayed its laughter.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	194.62	199.63	The theoreticians of empire tripping over the symmetries of their own semantics.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	200.46	206.312	The entrepreneurs paddling like eager surfers vying for position near the crest of the next wave.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	207.16	208.46	The voices on the street	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	208.59	210.764	at night calling out to one another.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	211.42	216.58	The athletes crouching on their benches, half following the action, awaiting their turns.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	217.56	221.22	Young mothers bearing their children on their hips at poolside.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	222.26	228.53	The thin old woman in tight jeans tightrope walking along the curb of the driveway, showing off.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	229.67	231.468	Don't want this train ride to end.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	232.24	233.597	When you get to the end	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	234.05	235.52	you want to hit restart	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	236.201	237.154	or as	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	237.32	240.779	when kids playing guns, we used to say when shot,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	241.231	242.323	I'm a new man.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	243.98	245.592	The words book.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	254.5	256.426	And I'm going to conclude with a	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	256.56	257.548	prose piece	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	257.583	258.835	{lipsmack} that's pretty new	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	259.299	262.83	and is part of the grand piano which is uh a collective	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	263.22	267.302	(()) what do we call it # a- an experiment in collective auto- autobiography ((and))	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	267.46	270.46	some of you may be aware of it or may have read some of it. It's= a=	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	271.05	271.736	it's a	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	271.89	274.28	autobiographical work by ten poets	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	274.583	275.739	who um	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	275.81	277.61	knew each other, and still know each other, but	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	277.73	280.33	wh- who were working in San Francisco	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	280.529	281.61	in the late seventies	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	281.993	283.165	and uh	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	283.24	286.152	it's been coming out # we've been working on it since, I think about	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	286.35	288.582	two thousand. I mean, it's been almost ten years now	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	288.9	291.71	and through correspondence on the internet	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	292.144	293.097	and um	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	294.04	296.48	uh I guess about three years ago	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	296.534	297.498	we started	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	297.755	298.334	uh	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	298.53	304.153	completing it and getting it out and it's= it's been published in a series of small books. I didn't bring a copy	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	304.53	307.77	um but um they're quite beautifully designed, they're	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	308.582	309.072	kind of	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	309.164	311.207	nice pocket size and each one	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	311.61	313.109	has um	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	313.2	316.594	one section by each of the ten poets and there will be ten uh	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	317.16	319.249	# when we finish, which will be with the next one	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	319.786	320.408	um	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	320.81	324.065	and m- most of the uh # m- most of the pieces are	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	325.922	326.555	um	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	327.65	331.452	an- (()) but everybody ((just)) kind of approaches it from a different angle and	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	331.626	333.07	I found that in doing it	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	333.3	335.196	it's th- # I sort of have to	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	335.38	337.178	reinvent how I do it every time.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	337.677	343.392	So I'm going to read the= the latest one and this one I guess is just out. I haven't seen it yet, but it's= it's uh part nine	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	344.228	345.09	and uh	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	345.74	348.39	in this one it's= it's more of an essay about	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	348.56	355.43	sort of, the problematics of= of writing autobiography and thinking about memory and thinking about time,	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	355.567	356.344	thinking about	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	356.78	358.385	the time in which	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	358.521	361.915	the story takes place, which is kind of back in the day, and then	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	362.09	367.35	the time in which the writing has taken place which really has= has covered, you know, almost a ten year period.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	368.011	368.724	um	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	369.108	370.48	And in fact, uh	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	390.25	394.44	Th- the version that appeared in that magazine was pretty short and uh	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	394.65	396.453	so as we were preparing	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	396.98	398.52	a copy for this one	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	398.78	401.17	uh I- I inserted a lot of new material.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	401.91	406.846	uh But all the original material is= is in here as is without any change but there's a lot more	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	406.917	407.854	uh in it now	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	408.68	410.756	and uh okay, so uh	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	413.0	415.997	uh it's called notes toward a phenomenology of time	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	416.21	418.04	and it starts with two epigrams.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	418.41	421.54	Of course when you're seventy three there are a lot of another times.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	422.14	424.548	uh Duke Snyder at Pee Wee Reese's funeral.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	426.17	431.922	Even if I say I have lived, or I shall live, it's present, because I'm saying it now.	Speaker1
