Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	83.55	88.194	The next question is how do sentences integrate the higher order units of meaning.	Subject

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	107.052	120.068	Behind the device of partitioning speech into units, which are termed paragraphs in their written form, lie orientation toward listener or reader in calculation of the latter's possible reactions.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	120.481	126.85	The weaker this orientation and calculation are the less organized, as regards paragraphs, our speech will be.	Subject

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	143.96	149.227	exposition of seeming discrepancies or illogicalities in one's own argument, and so forth.	Subject

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	162.29	167.286	But even this shift in verbal intention is ((in #)) conditioned by the addressee's interest.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	167.75	172.004	If we could imagine speech that absolutely ignored the addressee,	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	172.314	179.292	an impossible kind of speech of course, we would have a case of speech with organic partition reduced to the minimum.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	179.631	192.147	Needless to say we are not thinking here of certain special types of partition shaped by the particular aims and purposes of specific ideological fields.

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	192.427	199.746	Or the purely logical partition of speech of t- # of the ((tight premised)) conclusion, thesis, antithesis and the like.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	200.546	203.244	But we are of course thinking of exactly such things here.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	204.736	214.819	And I want to point out that um the thing # that the partitioning of paragraphs # the idea of a paragraph as a vitiated dialogue is something that uh	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	215.262	229.771	is not radically different from the strategies you see in the work of David Bronwich's Essay ((Bones)), my poetry and others', and David Anton when he gave a talk over at ((Eightieth Langdon)) Street ((and)) actually described his own work in uh exactly of Voloshinov's terms as a vitiated dialogue.

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	236.874	240.012	He suggests that the model of the above sentence	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	240.419	246.643	integration is classically the syllogism such as in, All women were once girls,	Subject

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	278.026	279.543	But this integration,	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	281.333	290.919	this assumption that all three of these intere- # these statements are interrelated, and in fact ((one rig)) higher orders of presumption about it, is in fact just a presumption.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	291.374	297.113	In the next paragraph in Plasma, Watton plays with the reader's recognition of that presumptiveness.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	297.618	299.461	That's why we talk language.	Subject

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	312.418	326.791	And uh the assumption is that s- # This is why we talk language, is again the sort of thing that you can only integrate with the previous sentence by making that what I am going to continue calling a syllogistic leap or a syllogistic movement above the level of the sentence	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	327.408	335.69	Two paragraphs before, the separation of the sentences in Plasma is so large it has to suppress the integration of sentences all together	Subject
