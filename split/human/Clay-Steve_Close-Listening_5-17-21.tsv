Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	0.035	5.69	um A fascinating thing and= and now we've both had a chance to read more literary history		
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	5.8	9.942	so= so we know going back to Blake, of course, who was such an outsider and printed	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	9.95	10.412	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	10.175	13.559	and engraved # create his own engraving techniques, his own books,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	13.759	14.568	but um	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	14.72	18.46	most l- literary # most poets exist within	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	19.51	21.724	you know, micro networks of	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	22.432	23.706	publishers or	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	23.85	25.944	bookstores that publish their work,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	26.094	30.535	that circulate to other poets, and you can sort of trace what those networks are	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	30.41	31.027	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	30.96	32.362	and I'm not saying network in a	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	32.96	35.58	contemporary {laugh} bureaucratic sense, I mean	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	34.608	35.38	Right, yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	35.96	40.688	you could trace those connections by looking at the where the books f- # the flow of the books	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	36.053	36.584	Yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	37.516	38.288	Oh, yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	40.62	41.461	Absolutely.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	40.875	45.148	and who publishes them. So you're really ((right at the center.)) So while you ((might))	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	41.817	44.474	Yeah, that's one of the most interesting # yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	45.172	48.69	found it, and I could imagine quite difficult, because distribution is	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	49.14	54.436	always a- a very difficult and unrewarding thing. Nonetheless, you learned a lot about the	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	55.07	56.237	# what was going on,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	56.432	57.807	how things worked.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	57.084	60.195	Well, yeah, I did and I # but I- I was also	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	60.42	62.556	st- # I was traveling a bit	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	62.66	67.118	and visiting libraries and that's how I was selling the books that we were distributing.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	67.7	74.765	People rarely bought anything from a list that we would send out, but if I would go around and visit people in special collections libraries	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	74.384	74.942	Yeah.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	75.04	76.875	they would invariably buy	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	77.16	78.98	many things, maybe	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	78.497	80.486	So that's when you got started with the	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	81.28	86.07	um # your relationship with= with special collections and libraries and ((placing)) books.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	84.752	89.47	That started it, the distribution and then # but then I realized when I did the Cage book I-	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	89.918	93.2	I knew that if I went around and showed it to people that they	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	93.766	96.197	# I would be able to sell this, you know, and	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	95.061	95.572	Yeah.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	96.37	98.103	so what made it possible	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	98.58	99.716	um having that	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	99.975	105.842	end point, you know, that end user point in mind and ((I'd)) met a lot of people by then	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	106.43	110.647	um I did # early # in the early eighties I came out and	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	110.853	116.053	attended the # something called rare book school, that was a summer program at Columbia University,	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	114.523	115.172	Mhm.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	116.504	117.527	and this was uh	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	117.61	118.446	filled with	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	119.28	123.04	all kinds of librarians from around the country and elsewhere	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	123.592	125.78	((studying)) aspects of rare books	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	126.017	126.602	um	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	127.1	130.89	and that was very useful in beginning to meet people, some of them I	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	131.0	135.544	still know now. All this time, and they were at the beginning of their career then as well.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	134.956	135.526	((Yeah.))	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	135.598	137.566	Now m- maybe a	Speaker1

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	163.294	163.835	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	164.26	169.38	((known)) works and it would be about the way in which those works were printed and set	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	169.778	171.116	or more conventional	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	171.5	173.44	writing, so you were combining	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	174.18	176.57	very radical poetic content,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	177.19	179.415	radical in the sense of	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	179.83	181.05	unconventional	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	181.433	182.648	and contemporary	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	182.768	183.337	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	183.334	185.148	versus more traditional	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	185.46	186.039	Right.	Speaker2

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	224.658	227.406	But what I'm interested in, drawing on that for a second, is	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	227.82	228.967	you know, the syncretic	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	229.33	231.054	((uh)) which is so important	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	232.07	239.502	to me in poetics. In your case the syncretism has to do with combining aspects of a very traditional fine press printing	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	239.366	239.951	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	239.756	241.179	and knowledge of=	Speaker1
