Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	74.2	77.491	and he died without seeing it returned to the way he knew it	Speaker1

Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	104.1	105.794	was a good friend of Chaucer's,	Speaker1	
Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	105.933	109.147	when a poet might not have lived to produce the works he did.	Speaker1	
Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	110.15	113.179	And it was, of the hundred twenty projected tales,	Speaker1
