Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	1.541	10.513	that joy lasts as long as your walk through the city and dissolves when you return home to your work to ho- how far there is left to go with it.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	15.061	21.703	In the fall of nineteen ninety seven, I moved into a two bedroom fat # flat, just up the street from my previous residence	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	22.221	24.001	though here everything was different.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	24.51	30.491	Now I had one roommate instead of three, which meant I could occupy the living space less anonymously.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	31.274	41.309	The reason I at times experience certainty that I started this book in the summer of nineteen ninety eight is that through the window of this new bedroom I saw my first concrete tree.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	41.801	48.32	I was struck by what I thought was an anomaly until I began seeing this type of tree all over that unique city.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	49.245	56.832	Within the first few sentences of the novella after that, you will find the concrete tree outside my window written quite simply.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	57.251	66.502	{lipsmack} Years later, I would have to rewrite that passage as too many people unfamiliar with the concept, concrete tree, worried over its incongruous presence.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	67.09	82.025	A few months ago, I addressed this concern by changing the text to, The trees outside my window are the first in ((a)) series of architectural leaps intended to beautify this city, these saplings protected by cylindrical holes of concrete	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	83.021	94.011	To those of you who also lived in this great cement city, I apologize for such an overt description, but there are certain things one cannot understand as o- # if one has never seen them.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	94.735	104.201	For instance it never snowed in my previous city, the city of the novella, yet today it is late March in my new city and flurries blow past the window	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	104.574	110.963	I have called ((Chubby)) to tell her this and she sputters, What, what, wrapping her mind around the concept	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	112.352	125.974	This is what you do when you're editing, isn't it? You move text around, you delete something that does not have the anticipated effect on your trial reader. You write down somewhere that you have deleted that thing, then you put a question mark beside it	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	126.612	141.069	How many times have I been thrown into confusion when explaining to someone the cuts I've made, that person being different from the trial reader, and that person has responded with a violent shake of the head, pressing the point, I totally understand that. Put it back in	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	141.943	155.09	The number of times I have done that matches the number of times I have run to a nearby park, thrown myself on a bench and fallen over with my head in my lap, my hands scraping the ground with the smallest of smiles on my face.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	155.799	158.673	Confusion is a gift, I have always thought	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	159.209	161.217	That is the reason for the smile	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	161.899	172.049	Similarly when I am in the midst of an overwhelming sadness, those moods that have no identifiable cause, I begin to marvel over the ability to have such feelings	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	172.38	182.893	I write something down, usually on a loose sheet of paper, thinking the feeling's too fleeting for my diary and give that smile again, buried in the typical frown of sadness.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	183.317	185.394	Because what I've written is beyond me.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	186.442	195.496	Eventually, one comes to know what belongs in a book one is writing and what does not and eventually one changes one's mind on all of this	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	196.531	219.419	I finished the final version of the novella after that sometime late summer two thousand and three after two extensive rewritings and probably two less intense reworkings and countless line and paragraph edits, plus two shelvings and one almost utter shredding, and then I ran outside. The relief I felt was tremendous, though ultimately short lived+.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	220.02	227.116	You have finished your novella, I told myself. You have made a place for it. I was in my new city when I said this	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	227.969	236.507	I had changed cities because I could not stand to see the demise of my old one, though I was aware that I had been living in its entrails for some time.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	237.043	247.847	But I do not think I need to reiterate my reasons for blinding myself to that reality. As it goes, I moved, many places at first then finally settled on this new one	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	248.491	260.575	Why am I here, I asked myself walking among its thousands of ghosts. I could not find an answer but in the interim I met a girl and became enamored with her. She will be referred to as ~M.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	262.043	269.269	I showed the novella to ~M once she had read my other work and upon finishing it she said, Hm, studying me.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	269.702	288.171	We were in a very large park. I think she turned her head to see if this park mirrored the one referred to in the novel. I didn't write it here, I explained it to her. She did not appear to believe me. Well, people will think what they want. It is their right, I suppose. But After That could never have been written in this city	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	288.973	312.115	I wrote it in a place of perpetual sun, a place that never rose above thirty degrees Celsius. I've given up Fahrenheit in protest of the government. It never sank below ten. A place of crowds that did not overwhelm one as they do here. A place whose incomparable ease explains the near flatness of the writing, this flatness which I could never alter and always haunted me.	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	313.224	317.916	That first summer in my new city, the sensation of my own flatness was very strong	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	318.287	321.889	With ~M in the park, I was struck by the persistence of it	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	322.226	329.222	this feeling which I thought had rid {NSV} # I had rid myself of by simply maturing as a person had never left me	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	329.657	336.033	It had just taken on another form, manifesting itself differently yet deep- deeper with every subsequent book	Subject	
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	336.621	355.97	It+ strikes often at the end of the day when I'm reviewing some work I have just written and I find myself thinking that it is not writing that I have done. It is speech or air, plain air. It is zero. It is a gesture, a sign, an indication of writing, but not writing. Not at all writing.	Subject
