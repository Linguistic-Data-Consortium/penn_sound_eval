Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	1.43	5.15	Kay came to my door in a pink skirt and a pink jacket,	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	5.43	7.261	both the color of dust.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	7.79	10.457	She opened her mouth and some dust came out.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	10.945	15.022	I am not totally sure what happened between the foyer and the apartment door.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	15.17	18.688	I am stammering. I did the treadmill for thirty five minutes.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	19.2	24.983	Her legs stuck out of her skirt and she murmured a lot and almost cried but did not cry one bit.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	29.993	30.924	Dear Kelly.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	32.51	35.055	All these weddings and their impulse toward the mirror.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	35.23	39.822	Sex like a collision we know sh- # we should avoid, wedding as ~X ~X ~X.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	39.94	43.868	Do you ever hate being American? Flying Virgin, loving the master.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	46.094	48.539	I wander the aisles at Ross	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	48.62	51.574	in search of a red blouse that ties up at the back.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	51.68	58.304	I'm thinking of the hushed motion, the crawl, the dark eye ((and)) the answer, the field of light around her palm.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	60.06	62.648	Did a lot of shopping at Ross when I was writing ((these)) poems.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	62.81	65.472	I worked across the street from one, it was kind of dangerous.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	68.455	69.306	um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	74.785	78.269	Sorry, I haven't read from a book before, so ((I was like)) {NSV} what should I read next.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	79.234	79.715	um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	80.461	81.249	{laugh}	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	84.762	85.783	Dear Kelly.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	86.84	89.91	Now that I know Sagittarius is in my north node	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	93.36	101.35	I have spent the day reading lines in an art gallery, trying to let my brain crawl into them, or at least under some pastoral light.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	102.03	105.797	I think I should like to be erased, like a certain word is from these letters.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	106.17	110.42	No, I think I'd like to hold a certain feeling, like a cut thing	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	110.58	117.727	with the light shining all around your forehead, and the last failed year toppled over at the entrance to one oh one on ((Bayshore.))	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	118.19	119.476	There was a sign there	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	119.57	121.001	and a view of the hill.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	127.501	128.363	Dear Kelly.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	129.76	133.67	Sweater instead of fear, eyeliner instead of reassurance.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	133.86	135.74	Cocktail as cough suppressant.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	136.04	141.459	Real men in real bar. I mean a bar cut like a man. I mean a bar cut like a piano.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	141.54	145.61	Cut to fit around the piano. I mean a bar cut like a Yamaha baby grand	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	145.82	149.07	and a glossy drink, and your lacquered face, and instead of	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	149.307	151.419	anaphora I said anathema	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	151.57	157.03	and the piano lodged under plexiglass like a big sideways fish, and beneath the mirror is my coat check,	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	157.094	160.472	is the cusp of your hand, is a mouth moving across the t-shirt.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	160.71	168.3	Long lines of the sun instead of the wrong side of the bed. In the bed instead of on the floor. I mean in the bed, but not in the bed.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	168.49	174.834	At the corner of the mouth, mouth across the t-shirt, and there is no narrow ((sleep)) before the portrait of your imaginary wife.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	175.115	181.181	So I moved to the other side of the bed and into the other side of the apartment, and then from the second floor to the ground floor,	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	181.225	186.944	I mean the ground. I mean the sidewalk where no one was wearing any costumes and the cab filled quickly with smoke.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	190.144	190.948	Dear Kelly.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	192.17	195.162	The runners on the Schuylkill locked in their corridors	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	195.34	199.786	pass bits of molded white plastic that carve up the winter air.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	200.42	207.878	Garbage cars on the tracks, the absence of ice, all the city steps I have taken in my foolishly sensible shoes.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	208.964	210.898	I can spell words on paper.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	211.72	216.34	You think that's all the work you need to do, but you are not yourself, you are not this futurity.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	216.76	219.79	When I played in the evening I was sore in (())	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	224.037	224.783	um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	225.86	229.926	And then I just thought I'd read a few new pieces here. um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	239.68	244.615	um This is a translation I did of son- of s- # Shakespeare's sonnet one twenty, which begins	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	244.97	247.898	that you were once unkind befriends me now.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	249.92	253.6	And it's called ~P ~S ~T sonnet. uh When I first moved to ~L ~A	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	254.1	259.514	They were, I think just launching this # I think it might still be going on, this huge um constellation of	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	259.578	263.476	art exhibits devo- # called public standard # er sorry, Pacific Standard Time.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	263.746	264.417	um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	264.766	268.176	I was thinking a lot about what it meant to move into Pacific Standard Time.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	268.28	270.873	Eileen Myles was just reading in ~L ~A and it was a	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	270.992	273.401	like perfect um tonic	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	273.57	277.162	for to # I mean, I'm originally from the West Coast but	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	277.359	278.105	um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	278.462	279.176	but	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	279.64	282.24	I feel like an East Coast transplant in ~L ~A	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	282.34	284.619	and for Allison and I both	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	284.711	285.409	um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	285.6	287.512	uh # for Allison and me both I think it was 	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	287.65	296.649	very healing to hear from another New Yorker who found it very jarring to be in {laugh} ~L ~A. And one of the things she said was,  th- # one of the hardest things about living in California is that you-	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	296.75	299.57	you're up late and so you think great, I can call someone in California.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	300.1	301.984	But I'm already here, so.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	304.04	306.056	So I was thinking a lot about Pacific Standard Time.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	309.07	311.72	A shaken sense, a glass hug.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	312.16	314.038	Even your shirt was lying.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	314.46	316.23	Your whole body full of liquid.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	316.8	319.795	I, there is a word blocking the bow.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	320.43	322.629	I, there is to go very shortly.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	323.14	324.442	A there bar.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	324.64	326.69	A there sacroiliac joint.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	327.11	329.34	Let's to the stone gallery.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	329.75	336.03	A video, ball drop, nineteen seventy four, where a ball is becoming light upon a windshield and smash.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	336.2	337.041	Like that.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	337.65	341.46	So let's ransom this hotel. Let's put a fee upon this feeling.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	341.82	343.59	To various century.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	343.99	347.199	Look up all the bones of the body to see what you can spare.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	347.82	349.39	Dark, grey green.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	349.72	351.298	Not everything can be sighted.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	351.68	353.263	I must needs.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	353.35	355.13	Green face lies.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	355.45	357.089	Fall apart for the day.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	357.618	359.9	Like I said, a glass hug.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	373.168	374.263	Etiological.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	374.827	378.348	um And this has a line in it from Bob (())	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	380.34	384.192	I dipped my hand in the garbage can and then I put my finger in my mouth.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	384.686	385.611	A sort of	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	385.78	389.07	first self, best self ideological position.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	391.222	395.92	A cold sort of laundry, many masses of cold, unforgivable cold.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	396.24	398.9	The shock is how ordinary it seems.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	399.6	404.747	You think that's all the work you needed to do. You think you can mask it, like drinking from the lake.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	405.71	407.601	That line exhausts me.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	408.18	410.827	Most people are not also adults.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	416.769	417.981	And ((this is)) um	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	418.97	420.487	# this last poem I'm going to read,	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	420.84	422.62	it's called ((Allison corporation.))	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	426.042	427.132	And it's for Allison.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	428.96	431.836	Outside the city is a thick line of thinking	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	431.849	439.37	and outside that line of thinking is a strip of water and outside that strip of water is a muscle. Lengthen the muscle.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	439.42	442.009	Show restraint and perfect tension.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	442.09	443.97	That is ((Allison corporation.))	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	445.09	446.76	California is not new.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	446.96	448.714	California is not new.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	448.92	450.673	California is not new.	Speaker1
