Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	0.393	4.76	Do you know where I could find another copy? (()) asked. I can't tell you how much it would mean to me.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	5.626	7.822	This one is for you, the woman answered.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	8.41	9.829	But it's yours, (()) said	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	10.519	13.399	it was mine. The woman said, but now I'm finished with it.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	13.655	16.14	I came here today to give it to you.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	18.526	19.128	Seven.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	20.029	23.815	Twelve years ago, my wife's sister went off to live in Taiwan.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	24.309	29.331	Her intention was to study Chinese, which she now speaks with breathtaking fluency	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	29.524	34.237	and to support herself by giving English lessons to native Chinese speakers in Taipei.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	35.044	38.093	That was approximately one year before I met my wife	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	38.419	41.278	who was then a graduate student at Columbia University.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	42.279	46.059	One day, my future sister in law was talking to an American friend,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	46.307	49.638	a young woman who had also gone to Taipei to study Chinese.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	50.193	53.95	The conversation came around to the subject of their families back home,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	54.219	56.877	which in turn led to the following exchange.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	57.906	61.745	I have a sister who lives in New York, my future sister in law said.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	62.572	64.531	So do I, her friend answered.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	65.105	67.545	My sister lives on the Upper West side.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	68.378	69.43	So does mine.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	69.755	72.549	My sister lives on West A Hundred and Ninth Street.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	73.449	75.299	Believe it or not, so does mine.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	76.024	80.027	My sister lives at three oh nine West A Hundred and Ninth Street.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	81.178	82.22	So does mine.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	82.847	87.718	My sister lives on the second floor of three oh nine West A Hundred and Ninth Street.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	88.306	93.093	The friend took a deep breath and said I know this sounds crazy, but so does mine.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	94.506	99.335	It is scarcely possible for two cities to be farther apart than Taipei and New York.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	99.506	106.052	They are at opposite ends of the earth, separated by a distance of more than ten thousand miles. And when it is day in one,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	106.163	107.486	it is night in the other.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	108.272	113.435	As the two young women in Taipei marveled over the astounding connection they had just uncovered,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	113.934	117.572	they realized that their two sisters were probably asleep at that moment.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	118.093	123.77	On the same floor of the same building in northern Manhattan. Each one was sleeping in her own apartment,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	123.989	128.789	unaware of the conversation that was taking place about them on the other side of the world.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	129.964	134.659	Although they were neighbors, it turned out that the two sisters in New York did not know each other.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	135.262	137.586	When they finally met two years later,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	137.825	140.393	neither one of them was living in that building anymore.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	141.583	143.4	Siri and I were married then.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	143.806	146.363	One evening, on our way to an appointment somewhere,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	146.587	151.379	we happened to stop in at a bookstore+ on Broadway to browse for a few minutes.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	151.941	154.26	We must have wandered into different aisles.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	154.674	155.632	And because I	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	155.914	161.003	# and because Siri wanted to show me something or because I wanted to show her something. I can't remember.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	161.356	163.719	One of us spoke the other's name out loud.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	164.359	165.443	A second later	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	165.7	167.473	a woman came rushing up to us.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	167.882	170.725	You're Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt, aren't you? She said.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	171.029	174.026	Yes, we said. That's exactly who we are. How did you know that?	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	174.471	177.51	The woman then explained that her sister and Siri's sister	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	177.782	179.969	had been students together in Taiwan.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	180.881	183.067	The circle had been closed at last.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	183.636	186.241	Since that evening in the bookstore ten years ago,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	186.486	190.123	this woman has been one of our best and most loyal friends.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	192.385	193.029	Eight.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	194.985	198.085	Three summers ago, a letter turned up in my mailbox.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	198.352	206.492	It came in a white oblong envelope and was addressed to someone whose name was unfamiliar to me. Robert M Morgan of Seattle, Washington.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	207.111	210.261	Various post office markings were stamped across the front,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	210.532	214.019	Not deliverable, unable to forward, return to writer.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	214.613	220.306	Mister Morgan's name had been crossed out with a pen and beside it someone had written not at this address.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	221.196	222.953	Drawn in the same blue ink,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	223.134	229.891	an arrow pointed to the upper left hand corner of the envelope accompanied by the words return to sender.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	230.631	236.859	Assuming that the post office had made a mistake, I checked the upper left hand corner to see who the sender was.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	237.687	242.431	There, to my absolute bewilderment, I discovered my own name and my own address.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	243.288	247.773	Not only that, but this information was printed on a custom made address label.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	248.168	253.177	One of those labels you can order in packs of two hundred from advertisements on matchbook covers.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	253.598	260.117	The spelling of my name was correct. The address was my address. And yet the fact was, and still is,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	260.38	265.204	that I have never owned or ordered a set of printed address labels in my life.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	266.219	270.159	Inside there was a single space, type written letter that began	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	270.373	274.64	{cough} Dear Robert, in response to your letter dated July fifteen,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	274.95	276.284	nineteen eighty nine,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	276.449	282.099	I can only say that, like other authors, I often receive letters concerning my work.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	283.029	286.111	Then in a bombastic, pretentious style,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	286.489	293.347	riddled with quotations from French philosophers and oozing with a tone of conceit and self satisfaction,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	293.569	295.437	the letter writer went on to praise	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	295.565	296.231	Robert	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	296.591	301.855	for the ideas he had developed about one of my books at a college course on the contemporary novel.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	302.425	304.225	It was a contemptible letter,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	304.372	307.183	the kind of letter I would never dream of writing to anyone.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	307.37	308.047	And yet	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	308.291	309.92	it was signed with my name.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	310.726	312.912	The handwriting did not resemble mine,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	313.21	314.607	but that was small comfort.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	315.139	319.47	Someone was out there trying to impersonate me. And as far as I know, he still is.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	321.082	324.974	One friend suggested that this was an example of mail art.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	325.555	333.706	Knowing that the letter could not be delivered to, Robert Morgan, since there was no such person, the author of the letter was actually addressing his remarks to me.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	334.717	338.502	But that would imply an unwarranted faith in the ~US Postal Service.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	338.919	346.237	And I doubt that someone who would go to the trouble of ordering address labels in my name and then sitting down to write such an arrogant, high flown letter	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	346.451	348.277	would leave anything to chance.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	348.758	349.615	Or would he?	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	349.987	354.2	Perhaps the smart alecks of this world believe that everything will always go their way.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	355.244	358.914	I have scant hope of ever getting to the bottom of this little mystery.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	359.352	364.562	The prankster did a good job of covering his tracks and he has not been heard from since.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	365.567	372.615	What puzzles me about my own behavior is that I have not thrown away the letter even though it continues to give me chills every time I look at it.	Subject
