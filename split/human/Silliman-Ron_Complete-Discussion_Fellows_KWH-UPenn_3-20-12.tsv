Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	2.09	3.983	of dreams an old tomb.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	4.027	6.412	The band itself half forgotten	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	6.434	9.668	beneath the shards of melody to locate a tone	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	9.738	14.153	as an index to emotions not recognized at the time but held	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	14.259	18.481	closely, more so than that to which we thought we'd paid attention.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	18.8	21.721	A quality of light underneath the streetlamp	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	21.783	23.607	is how it dampens color.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	23.647	27.966	How color itself is a thing imposed as the sun imposes day.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	28.11	31.264	Day when it arrives, if it arrives, is layered	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	31.281	34.446	and must be stripped, though never in the same way twice.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	34.526	37.856	If ever we are to discover the ((pulse)) at the core.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	37.927	40.253	What fiction? What nonsense?	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	40.316	44.72	Voices over in the corner jabbering with no thought of who listens.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	45.39	49.803	The line already is inherent and the upright letter oriented.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	50.12	52.051	Speech is not a given.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	52.18	55.795	The tongue is infected. It is very cold.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	55.948	58.637	Worlds hurdle through the night sky,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	58.711	63.592	where it is apparent that day is the exception, that it may even be a fiction,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	63.632	67.123	a creation not of light, but of desire.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	67.33	69.426	I want speech.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	69.55	75.21	Sky, air, wind, sun, surround. For want of storm windows we hung quilts.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	75.349	79.785	Birds shake snow from the lighter branches. The traction	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	79.875	80.716	faction.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	80.728	85.335	One doesn't so much sleep under all these blankets as one does cook.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	85.575	87.73	Pencil is a blunt instrument.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	87.818	92.259	In a coma, I am told, all evidence of palsy disappears.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	92.379	96.457	You yawn freely, widely, the way an infant yawns asleep.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	96.756	103.003	I shall not hear birds in these trees again. Words hurdle through the night sky.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	103.476	104.146	Three.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	104.3	108.999	Stripped of furnishings, the familiar house became exactly what it was.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	109.15	113.56	An object, alien, a machine, each room a potential or function.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	113.68	119.233	There in the leafless forest we could see the huge nest high atop a poplar.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	119.46	126.96	From here I can walk to the train. So much assumed in the instant. Twenty five bones per hand or foot.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	127.1	133.005	Three muscles roughly for every bone. Behind that wall, the low hum of the surface.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	133.144	135.892	After several days of warmer temperatures	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	135.961	138.346	the snow still has not melted.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	138.378	141.051	The last mounds dark and translucent.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	141.167	142.42	Cakes of ice.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	142.716	143.883	Odd how	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	144.003	146.692	after thirty years a phrase such as,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	146.74	148.778	the beauty wapiti,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	148.867	151.06	still rings in the mind.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	151.143	152.7	Oncoming cars,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	152.722	155.16	headlights shimmer dimly in the fog.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	155.174	158.05	At the road's edge back in the streets	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	158.092	161.518	the deer watch us, witness without interpretation.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	161.6	169.12	The flower's knowledge of its own process is not counted as mind. I walk with each hand balled	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	169.25	170.554	into a fist	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	170.584	171.302	four	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	171.529	172.407	oh yeah,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	172.45	175.978	you're one of the ones who can write in the dark.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	179.613	187.387	Thank you, Ron. So we have some time for questions. Molly's got the microphone. Who's going to be brave and ask the first question?	Speaker2	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	188.72	191.957	And here we go. Right in the back there, Molly.	Speaker2	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	201.776	202.467	Good morning.	Speaker2	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	202.374	207.238	So I= uh I wanted to talk about the blog a little bit more before it gets too far away from that.	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	207.629	208.433	um	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	208.713	217.425	And I was really curious # I mean, you talked a lot abo- # you talked a little bit about how it's a way to educate people without the filter of the university	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	217.288	217.995	Grotesque.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	218.048	220.492	G- grotesque filter of the university.	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	219.052	221.774	You like that word. {laugh}	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	220.276	222.623	{laugh} You said it.	Speaker2	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	222.439	228.689	{laugh} um And I= I remember a couple of years ago when you disabled comments on your blog	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	228.534	229.215	Yes.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	229.091	230.931	and the reasoning you gave was	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	231.11	235.829	trolling and flaming and I know the Buffalo poetics listserv kind of had the same thing a few years ago	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	236.0	237.687	and um I mean it's	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	237.85	242.753	# the= the first thing I thought of was a sort of generational thing because I think for the young people in here, like	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	242.88	248.053	we see YouTube comments or these kinds of things that you= know= you= know= you know what to ignore and you know what to listen to.	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	248.25	252.02	um So I was curious if you think there is any sort of like general	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	252.28	254.33	uh # generational divide in	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	254.58	259.25	you know, language we accept, if there's a valuation of language in the discussion	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	259.42	261.49	um that kind of goes on on the internet.	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	261.791	262.692	um ((If)) (())	Speaker3	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	262.421	270.614	Well (()) actually it's more gender than= a= than a generational one, at least with regards to the blog but I # I'll try and deal with both of these.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	270.928	271.785	um	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	272.39	274.233	I # as my job	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	274.8	279.439	during the l- # the last twelve years ramped up in the amount of time it absorbed	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	279.65	284.2	my ability to police the comments section on a daily basis	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	284.43	287.53	uh was beginning to extend further and further.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	287.818	294.483	um There were a number of people # are a number of people, not just on my blog but elsewhere on the net,	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	294.785	295.647	um	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	295.71	300.57	who do seem to be completely unaware of the implications	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	300.714	305.228	of some of their language when they use terms of color and gender	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	305.36	312.323	when, you know, it's the (()) # you know, there's the joke of the old Saturday Night Live routine Jane, you ignorant slut.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	312.475	318.28	When somebody hears them self called that on the weblog by somebody whose name they know it's actually less pleasant.	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	318.447	319.411	um	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	319.53	324.2	and uh not catching every one of those every day 	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	324.34	326.07	meant that I was	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	326.552	331.3	having a reaction that was I think dividing my readership by gender	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	331.42	336.2	so that I was get- # my blog was becoming more and more of a male space	Speaker1	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	336.437	340.57	and with all the negative aspects of the male space	Speaker1
