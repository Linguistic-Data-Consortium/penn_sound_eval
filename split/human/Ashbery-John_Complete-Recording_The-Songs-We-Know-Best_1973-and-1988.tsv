Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	0.146	6.783	It's woven in the flowers of the patterned spread, and lies ((and)) knows not what it thinks upon the bed.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	8.123	11.24	I wish to come to know you, get to know you all,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	11.46	14.545	((let your)) belief in me, and me in you stand tall,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	15.33	17.809	just like a project of which no one tells,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	18.16	20.55	or do you still think that I am somebody else.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	20.886	21.577	Thank you.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	30.668	31.509	Sonnet.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	33.78	36.35	Each servant stamps the reader with a look.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	36.94	39.814	After many years, he has been brought nothing.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	40.57	43.128	The servant's frown is the reader's patience.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	43.9	47.52	The servant goes to bed. The patience rambles on	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	47.79	50.553	musing on the library's lofty holes.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	51.85	53.84	His pain is the servant's alive.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	54.33	58.575	It pushes to the top stain of the wall, its treetop's head of excitement.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	59.1	61.62	Baskets, birds, beetles, spools.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	62.07	64.177	The light walls collapse next day.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	64.75	67.184	Traffic is ((the)) reader's pictured face.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	67.88	70.347	Dear, be the tree your sleep awaits.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	70.72	72.323	Worms be your words,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	72.51	74.305	you not safe from ours.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	85.616	90.138	This one is called How Much Longer Will I Be Able to Inhabit the Divine Sepulcher.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	92.78	97.374	How much longer will I be able to inhabit the divine sepulcher of life, my great love.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	98.03	100.73	Do dolphins plunge bottomward to find the light?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	101.23	104.165	Or is it rock that is searched, unrelentingly.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	104.381	104.885	((Huh.))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	106.22	110.774	And if some day men with orange shovels come to break open the rock, which encases me,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	111.07	116.027	what about the light that comes in then? What about the smell of the light? What about the moss?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	116.95	119.098	In pilgrim times he wounded me.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	119.497	121.091	Since then I only lie.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	121.57	124.757	My bed of light is a furnace choking me with hell	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	125.13	127.636	and sometimes I hear salt water dripping.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	128.531	129.228	I mean it,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	129.74	135.494	because I'm one of the few to have held my breath under the house. I'll trade one red sucker for two blue ones.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	135.611	137.04	I'm named Tom.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	138.18	143.26	The light bounces off mossy rocks down to me in this glen. The neat villa	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	143.479	145.805	which when he'd had he would not ((had he of))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	146.34	148.05	And jests ((smarting and privet))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	148.909	150.488	which on hot spring nights	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	150.75	154.544	perfumes the empty rooms with the smell of sperm flushed down toilets	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	154.92	157.71	on hot summer afternoons within sight of the sea.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	158.09	160.074	If you knew why then, professor,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	160.24	161.65	reads to his friends	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	162.12	163.637	Drink to me only (())	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	164.01	167.03	and the reader is carried away by a great shadow under the sea.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	168.17	170.139	Behind the steering wheel {cough}	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	170.53	172.282	a boy took out his own forehead.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	172.82	175.91	His girlfriend's head was a green bag of narcissus stems.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	176.436	177.592	Okay, you win.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	177.91	181.184	But meet me anyway at ((Cohen's)) drug store in twenty two minutes.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	182.18	183.924	What a marvel is ancient man.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	184.67	188.09	Under the tulip roots he has figured out a way to be a religious animal	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	188.38	189.908	and would be a mathematician.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	190.91	194.441	But where in ((unsuitable)) heaven can he get the heat that will make him grow?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	194.98	199.09	For he needs something, or will forever remain a dwarf, though a perfect one.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	199.22	201.179	Possessing a normal sized brain.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	201.59	204.19	But he's got to be released by giants from things.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	204.69	208.49	And as the plant grows older, it realizes it will never be a tree.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	208.8	211.152	Will probably always be haunted by a bee	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	211.5	215.12	and cultivate stupid impressions so as to not become part of the dirt.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	215.51	217.318	The dirt is mounting like a sea	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	217.878	223.34	and we say goodbye, shaking hands in front of the crashing of the waves that give our words lonesomeness	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	223.8	226.26	and make those flabby hands seem ours.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	226.88	230.47	Hands that are always writing things on mirrors for people to see later.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	231.314	233.026	Do you want them to water ((plant?))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	233.33	238.48	Tear listlessly along exchangeable ivy, carrying food to mouth, touching genitals	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	239.31	244.008	But no doubt you have understood it all now, and I am a fool. It remains for me to get better.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	244.05	247.27	and understand you so like a chair sized man.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	248.37	250.22	((Boots)) were heard on the floor above.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	250.71	253.099	In the garden the sunlight was still purple.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	253.46	257.145	But what buzzed in it had changed slightly, but not forever.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	257.6	261.47	But casting its shadow on sticks and looking around for an opening in the air	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	261.7	264.696	was quite as if it had never refused to exist differently.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	265.47	268.286	((Guys)) in the yard handled the belt he had made.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	268.69	271.57	Stars painted the garage roof crimson and black.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	272.18	276.016	He is not a man who can read these signs. His bones ((were stays))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	276.62	284.128	and even refused to live in a world and refunded the hiss of all exists terribly near us, like you, my love and light.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	285.103	287.45	For what is obedience but the air around us	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	287.763	288.657	to the house	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	289.045	290.885	for which the ((federal)) man came	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	291.18	293.883	in a minute after the sidewalk had taken you home	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	294.175	295.021	Latin.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	295.222	296.058	Blossom.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	297.46	301.998	After which you led me to water and bade me drink, which I did, owing to your kindness.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	302.79	305.507	You would not let me out for two days and three nights,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	306.07	309.694	bringing me books bound in wild thyme and scented wild grasses	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	310.16	312.79	as if reading had any interest for me, you.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	313.44	314.655	Now you are laughing.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	315.21	317.066	Darkness interrupts my story.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	317.326	318.263	Turn on the light.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	319.46	321.141	Meanwhile, what am I going to do?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	321.699	323.983	I am growing up again, in school.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	324.11	325.82	The crisis will be very soon.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	326.4	328.67	And you twist the darkness in your fingers.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	328.97	330.638	You, who are slightly older.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	331.53	332.834	Who are you, anyway?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	333.94	335.609	And it is the color of sand,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	335.73	338.05	the darkness, as it sifts through your hand.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	338.58	340.319	Because what does anything mean?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	340.49	341.97	The ivy and the sand.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	342.34	344.262	((That)) boat pulled up on the shore.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	344.9	346.79	Am I wonder, strategically,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	347.2	350.936	and in the light of the long sepulcher that hid death and hides me.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	361.57	368.373	The line in this poem about the un-assassinated president uh does not have any relation to the assassination of President Kennedy	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	368.65	370.611	since the poem was uh written	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	370.809	371.987	two years before that.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	375.42	376.742	Rivers and mountains.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	378.08	380.55	On the secret map the assassins cloistered.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	380.74	384.081	The moon river was marked near the eighteen peaks.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	384.36	386.438	((and the)) city of humiliation and defeat.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	387.36	390.42	((Wan)) ending of the trail among dry, papery leaves	Speaker1

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	393.58	398.024	and the melodious but vast mass of today's writing through fields and swamps	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	398.35	400.984	marked on the map with little bunches of weeds.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	401.99	404.05	Certainly squirrels lived in the woods	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	404.68	408.026	but devastation and dull sleep still hung over the land.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	408.23	411.52	Quelled, the rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	412.03	417.834	Singing on marble factory walls, deaf consolation of minor tunes that pack the air	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	418.07	419.81	with heavy, invisible rods	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	420.22	422.003	pent in some sand valley	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	422.34	424.951	to which only quiet walking ever instructs.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	426.18	429.435	The bird flew over and sat. There was nothing else to do.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	430.16	432.91	Do not mistake its silence for pride or strength	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	433.5	435.336	or the waterfall for a harbor	Speaker1
