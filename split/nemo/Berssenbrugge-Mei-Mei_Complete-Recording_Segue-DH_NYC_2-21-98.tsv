The respiratory system when stimulated produces a characteristic sign. The sinus extends itself during stress and collapses so the autopsy finds only a membrane. Touching a wall produces the sound of touch on another wall. Feedback between health and fate unfolds so fast there's no way one step in the chain can be based on the previous one. An associative sneer or aura requires her to be in a body in order to make decisions. Lack of cloud cover causes thermal energy on the desert to return rapidly to the sky at night.  It makes light, lighting the organs, they turn white. There is a space you see something at the far edge, and your eye going over this space makes a hole, like watery mass in a gourd, the feeling of old organs no longer crucial to or inside themselves, while remembering people you loved, which flowed from the physical, about which you made decisions. To make this hole any object brings into being something not in nature, an interior measurement, yourself not yourself, bursts of growth when you sleep.  Black leaves, a spray of blood on the snow. She sits on her hands physically preventing herself from scratching. The child, her sense of the world being crucial to or inside itself, of memory and specificity like script. These cells grow for years in a petri dish, the sick immortalized cells don't know to stop growing. Where your eye goes over space to the horizon makes a hole, but where its sky meets the earth, the fragment is not the same as a whole. Desert ferns covered with reflecting hair may insulate the fronds. Radiations of a state barely embodied and dissolving encounter reflections of light.  He cannot separate from the loved person to shed the loved body. So, this is the first poem I wrote since I finished the four year old girl manuscript. It has a more narrative style.  Kiki Annie except three parts. Susie Kiki Annie. On its own terms, my project with them developed a gentle momentum. The vulnerability of their situation engendered by an unassuming spirit of play and togetherness. On my way to work I passed several family members standing in a group close together. I asked each one to tell me his or her thoughts, and I tried to remember them all. My sister has just fixed the motorcycle of her friend Tom, and she's waiting for him.  One of them, a fox turns to look at me as if in nature, but she's drawn it, it's symbolic. What can someone who looks like my sister encompass on a different level if she were not my sister, or if I had no knowledge of the formal relation? A projector in the dark casts a line of light under the door. Energy of the gap between my sister and the strategy that construes her as pure appearance disperses along the web of family interrelations. There's a stringent physical link, but what goes on inside.  It seems close to freedom I know as my power of imagination, so strong it appears as a deliberate loss of information. One fox an open structure empties like a funnel. One fox enters the world. It does not appear to be an image. There's a relationship between them in which she is involved, walking between animals of sleep and late light like blood. I'm interested in the alleged realism of the fox while she sees it as actually behind the scenes. They watch me in suspense.  There's a mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding. Lately I've been interested in failing to make something exciting, equating the act of walking from one tree to another with understanding. I try to speak to her in a way in which she might take me seriously and answer back. The situation is an image of her gathering a toy horse from beside each candle, of my sister on a white horse, of the horse stepping backwards in water.  She stands there for a long time and takes out of her pocket one of the toy horses. She tells me about it as if I were also a lover of horses, but I am not, as she well knows. The way in which she shares her happiness as a matter of course gives me a sense of guilt because I do not feel the happiness. All the animals in the story who eventually die consist of tiny lines scratched into reddish brown. The white of an eye is scratched away, but the pupil is ink. Many appear sleepy as if they'd just wakened up. Squirrel, little cat, fawn. She wears an oily smock and cloth.  with a rubber daisy on each one. Light glints off her glasses as she waits with an awkwardness that's folks conspicuous and nonchalant. She feels their presence in the woods as an a priori model light subject to decline. Her empathy makes it possible to read the story and see it as a picture at the same time. Is this story of defeat and disappointment, uncertainty, interference, malfunction, transcended by the present situation of competent employment? She loses track of her thought, then resumes, after laughing at herself. The horse takes a small jump in the air.  and her head and shoulders arch back. I see mini mouse instead of a thin girl in a cotton smock. The ambiguity releases energy. No one enters the family unit except through the magnetism of this energy. Stolid girls scowl like an old man. Wild girls in a meadow in the afternoon are subject to an evaluation in which cheapness cannot be avoided. She marks time with her hand and the horse curls its neck and head around her.  So, I'm going to
