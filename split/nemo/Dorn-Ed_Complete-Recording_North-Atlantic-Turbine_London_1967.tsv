Dorn-Ed_Complete-Recording_North-Atlantic-Turbine_London_1967	0.0	423.07	 the winter sanctuary of the rare jail bird and the Ishmaelite, the esoteric summer fire bombs of Chicago, the same scar tissue I saw in Pocatello made by the rapacious geoeconomic surgery of Harriman, the old isolator, that ambassador at large. You talk of color? O cosmological America, how well and with what geometry you teach your citizens. This is the first note from London.  As we go through Sussex, hills are round, bellies are the downs, pregnantly lovely, the rounds of them, no towns, the train passes shaking along the groove of the countryside. Travel to Newcastle is west of the moors, or east of the western moors. Between it all one goes, and everything is aye, and bonnie. Cold then, the note is Catnandoo, the outward point. How far the people see, in a naturally cold place, pots of tea, and a collection of fires.  So lovely she is, England, with her swollen bellies, all the way to the stone cardboard of Brighton, pale this winter, a paper jewel whose regent strolled. We got into one of those old coaches which has no access forward or back but is self contained, and it was strained being so enclosed and locked off by the speed of passage, alone, and even though she was my wife we flirted, almost we were in our confusion shy, scarcely believing our situation.  situation so sealed off. We considered, of course, making it then and there while moving, but settled for a quiet kiss when halfway through it, abruptly and to our amazement, we found ourselves in some small station smiling into the equally smiling face of a railway man idling on that minor and unremembered platform. Nonetheless, we were sober and chaste and slightly disappointed from thence to Croydon. This poem is entitled Thesis.  Only the illegitimate are beautiful, and only the good proliferate, only the illegitimate. O Akhlovik, only you are beautiful. Ah, Akhlovik, your main street is dead. Only the blemished are beautiful, only the deserted have life made of whole, unsurpassable night. Only Akhlovik is life inside life inside itself. They have gone who walk stiltedly on the legs of life.  All life is in the northern hemisphere turning around, the radicals of gross pain and great joy. The poles of pure life move into the circle of our north. O Aklavik, only the outcast and abandoned to the night are faultless. Only the faultless have fallen, only the fallen are the pure children of the sun. Only they move west, only they are expected in the virgin heat by those who wait intensely for the creatures from the east. Only Aklavik, our Aklavik, is known.  And lovely, always abandoned, always dark, whose warp is light. Simple fear compels Inuvik, her liquor store lifts the darkness by the rotation of a false summer. The children of the sun never go to Inuvik on bloody feet, half starved, or suffering the absolute intrusion of any food. O Aklavik, they vomit on your remote and insupportably obscure streets, which run antiseptically into the wilderness. And if black flies inhabit with the insistence of castanets the delta.  of Inuvik, in you, Aklavik, around you, Aklavik, they form a core and critical shell of inflexible lust. Only in the permafrost is the new home of the children, of the sun, in whose nakedness is the desire, not desire, in whose beauty is the flame of red permafrost, a thousand feet deep, in whose frail buildings the shudder of total winter, in whose misshapen sun the children bathe. OXFORD PART I. FORNICATION.  From Paddington, along one of the radials of London, which are the Oxford types, I asked myself, in the coach, the girl with the swell legs? Oxford has some of the richest and most beautiful women in the world, the Sunday Supplement said. The one from Argentina, the one from Portugal, a couple of straight American girls too clean to be real, rich, unquestionably. A Swedish girl, all weird countries, and variously do their kunts shine with radiant national deposits, a kind of enlightenment, if you will.  enlightened self interest, those care packages are kept at home until full grown, then sent abroad, wrapped in fur. We are the witness to all it is possible with such instruments as nations and mellifluous boxes to suck up the part of the world they may in any given period have wanted, and still want, and which they do want. Alias the good life this is their most rigid virtue, and not importantly education. They perpetuate their own kind in that way with old visions of Congolese Urania,  in the air, while the stolidly engaged back home cry out to boulevard, thinking that is where they are. The music of that desire is a richly orchestrated tapestry of instruction for their daughters here, teach them to ruin you, answer their questions, or because mass production allows a visual proximity and burns out the memory in men,
