They both were fighters, my mother and father. I remember him pulling the tablecloth off the table when his breakfast didn't suit him. What a mess. And the time she threw a meat cleaver after him and it stuck in the door jamb inches from his head. He stopped and she says he turned pale but he left. Time and again he left and when he came back it's called coming back home after a few months or whatever time they'd get along until they didn't.  All over Texas, never more than six months in a place, usually it was closer to three or four, and they fought wherever they were together. So I never made any friends that lasted, and everything was various depending on whether it was just my mother and me, or whether my father was there, and whether they were trying to run a restaurant together, or whether my mother was working as a waitress. Do you know that breakfast shift, dinner shift, swing shift vocabulary? There was once when she worked in a candy factory coating chocolates and putting the identifying little swirl on top. What I remember most often is that we were just the two of us living in a bedroom in somewhere.  And my mother's salary would run ten dollars a week, and the room plus board for me and the landladies looking after me would run seven. I don't mean to make this sound pathetic. At some time during that, when I was five, I started school, and I was a whiz. I went through the first and second grade the first year, and I went through the third and fourth grade the second year. And the third year when I was seven, I was in the fifth grade and broke my arm twice, so I got slowed down.  My father was with us then and we were living in a three room house with a yard and honeysuckle on the porch at the bottom of a hill that's notable for a line of twenty foot high block letters filled with regular light bulbs that in the night glared out welcome toward the highway. I loved that sign. It felt like being in church to stand at the base of those letters. Just to finish that part of the story, the next year we went to New Mexico and I went from being a whiz to passing the sixth grade conditionally. I was a kind of house dummy thereafter. I don't remember whether I had any notion.  of what went wrong. It feels like years of chaos. My father finally truly left around then. We sat in my Aunt Thelma's house south of Albuquerque and he roamed in the night around the house yelling, Nora. And my uncle Everett would yell back, Nora doesn't want you anymore. And I've got a twenty two here. And my father finally left for good. But while I feel like that has to be told somehow, these few pages going the way they've gone, what I really want to mention and it took me until yesterday to get it into the air is that all that time and right from the first reading.  was my darling pleasure. There was a running set of lies that got handed to me all the time I was growing up. Whenever issue number one came up.  All the women's faces changed and all the girls were lied to. I realized it was a conservative and protective device, but at my end of it, it added up to a lot of confusion. For instance, my fourteenth birthday was marked by my first visit to a dentist. Dentists are on hard times in West Texas, where the water has natural fluoride. My mother's nearing sixty and has had three fillings all her life long, and she got those because she moved away from Texas. Anyway, at the time I'm talking about, we were living in York, Pennsylvania, to be near my stepfather before he went off to war, and it was my fourteenth birthday.  The boy, a boy who was maybe sixteen, was going to come to the apartment later and formally ask my parents if he could take me on my first official date. They had agreed that he could ask, so it seemed likely the answer was yes. While I was at the dentist's, my mother started to show Dutch the presents I had got from my friends, three or four small things, one of which was the classic five year diary, which fell open when she laid it down. But what I had immediately written in on receiving it so as not to forget, the entry was the week before in the movie house with my friends, I had kissed Dutch.  boy who was due to arrive around four this afternoon. It was there in black and white with ecstatic exclamation marks. That entry proved to be the first and last of that possibility. one thousand eight hundred twenty four days down the drain, precluded by stupidity. I had taken the abstraction of my diary as an allowance, proof against getting hoisted on the hook because you wrote it down, the power of a defined occasion. And I learned the way it really was when I got back from the dentist and faced those two faces, me the birthday girl and then the tribunal.  There was no doubt that I had made a mistake. My mother took me into the kitchen to talk to me. Kissing in the movies is vulgar, but worse than that, and she rang the shift on me. No girl should kiss a boy until they're engaged. I couldn't believe it that she was saying it. I looked at her, and she looked as solemnly back as if she meant to stand by that statement against come what may. I just lost my place. I couldn't believe it. I mean, she came off a fall.  And when Aunt Myrtle's baby came, seven months after she was married,
