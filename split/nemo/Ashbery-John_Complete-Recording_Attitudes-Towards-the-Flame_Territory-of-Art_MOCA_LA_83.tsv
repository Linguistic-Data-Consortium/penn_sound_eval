The three poems were written over a period of about a year and a half, maybe. I didn't quite know what I wanted to do. I thought it would be interesting to write poetic prose that wasn't poetic, in other words, a prose poem that really drew on the resources of prosiness as well as poetic sounding language. And indeed, I tried to get as many different tones of writing and voice as possible. So I guess I fairly early on imagined this work as being kind of three.  Large oblong boxes that I was going to have to fill with something, and I didn't really know what that was going to be. And that's frequently the case when I begin writing, I can sort of see the shape of the poem, but it's just an empty outline and no idea what I'm going to end up. This is a passage from the system, from one of the three poems in the book, three poems.  I know now that I am no longer waiting, and that the previous part of my life in which I thought I was waiting, and therefore only half alive, was not waiting, although it was tinged with expectancy, but living under and into this reply which has suddenly caused everything in my world to take on a new meaning. It is as though I had picked up a thread which I had merely mislaid, but which for a long time seemed lost, and all because I am certain now, albeit for no very good reason, that it was this one and no other. The sadness that infected us as children, and stayed on through adulthood, has healed, and there can be no other way except this way of health we are taking.  silent as it is, but it lets us look back on those other seemingly spoiled days and reevaluate them. Actually, they were too well rounded, each bore its share of happiness and grief, and finished its tale just as twilight was descending. Those days are now an inseparable part of our story, despite their air of immaturity and tentativeness. They have the freshness of early works, which may be wrongly discarded later. Nor is today really any different. We are as childish as ever, it turns out, only perhaps a little better at disguising it, but we still want what we want when we want it, and no power on earth is stronger than it.  strong enough to deny it to us. But at least we see now that this is how things are, and so we have the sense to stop insisting every so often, under the guise of some apparently unrelated activity, because we think we shall be better satisfied this way. Underneath the discreet behavior, the desire is as imperious as ever. But after so many postponements, we now realize that a little delay won't hurt, and we can relax in the assurance of eventual satisfaction. This was the message of that day in the street, when you first perceived that conventional happiness would not do for you, and decided to opt for the erratic kind, despite the dangers that it's needed.  for continual growth and expansion exposed it to. This started you on your way, although it often seemed as though your feet had struck roots into the ground and you were doomed to grow and decay like a tree. Nevertheless, you were aware of moving, whether it was you who were moving or the landscape moving forward toward you, and you could remain patient with the idea of growth as long as the concept of uniqueness, that one and no other, shone like a star in the sky above you. John Ashbury, reading a passage from  The system from his book Three Poems. For the reader of Ashbury's work, one initial obstacle is overcoming the expectation of a literal sequential understanding. Well, it seems I think people bring this expectation to almost any poetry and are destined to be disappointed since I don't think this condition is unique to me by any chance but applies to almost any poetry that I can think of. It's impossible to have a completely expository poem.  in mind, and then sit down and write it, and it will be exactly as it was conceived. All kinds of strange things happen while one is writing, which deflect the original intent. And my own work, I guess, is just an extreme example of letting this happen. To me, it seems more truthful since it's a more complete reflection of my thought while I'm writing.  In nineteen seventy eight, composer Eliot Carter wrote an unusual work titled Syringa for mezzo soprano, bass and chamber ensemble. The bass sings a collection of Greek texts on the legend of Orpheus, while the mezzo soprano simultaneously sings John Ashbury's poem called Syringa. The myth of Orpheus is that of the legendary singer who brings his beloved Eurydice back from death, an allegory about the presumed power of music and poetry to turn time back and stop.  Irretrievable loss. Even before Syringa, Ashbury had long admired Carter. What is it about Carter's music that the poet finds so sympathetic to his work? Well, the fact I guess that it's so complex and yet so clear at the same time. Why should that be good? Well, because I think it reflects experience much more accurately.
