I am very unwilling and not obliged to write my history of melancholy, but to let madam do what unhappy fancy that confinement and fetters, too ugly to kiss Doctor Shanson, would not trouble too much with the lives of the poets, in unmerciful nights and great want of company, sadly broken, but one of the most fervent and eloquent prayers.  I think Johnson's History of Melancholy has got to be one of the unwritten books we most regret, because I'm not sure what it would tell us, but it's bound to be interesting. And the only person who'd come anywhere near him in promise of books which he'd ever wrote is Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In a way, writing these little poems is what I have to do all the time is to look for the specific density of a poet's language. And once you've found that, the rest of the poem is there.  And with some poets, even quite difficult poets, you can find that specific density quite quickly. With Coleridge, you've got to swim through an ocean of words before you even get any sense of it. And so, in many ways, the Coleridge life is by far the most complex of these. Half awake and half asleep dreamer of ugly things and little tales, in a rage for a sunny corner and Bowles' sonnets, my illegible unchastities.  of tenacious memory in Henley Pesthouse, with a perfectable scheme of Cottage Dell and Brother Southey, and to marry the woman I, Watchman, love best of all created beings. These poems and a flaming prospectus. A father transpierced, Brother Poole, I have read almost everything, while Wordsworth and his sister and myself afloat in a sort of reverie. To feel what I now feel, Laudanum alone gave me repose.  This silence and hipt my poor muse and keynote pain, scribbler ghost until nature in her long entrancement, a bulgy black drop precipice blended, ebon her name ebon, and if on my cheek I conjure lazy bed shadows into Azra, echo upon echo twelve drops an eighth part of what I took at Keswick, dreams as my life I dread to write and sleep, my pocket books the history of every error, most shocking pandemonium of grief.  Shame. Lancinations of jealousy. W. The Bed SH. Cancel. El Pizermine. Mammia pulcherima aperta. Cancel. I, that dire poison and delusive thoughts cruelly crowd for a time. Darling passion, or tyrannic, that spider webbed steel in which my soul flutters, contemptuous silence, and W's no hope of me whirled about, a chasm, claw like consciousness, a shadow which tells us what we are not, an immedicable nothing, but contradiction around it against new terrors, that full uncurtainment.  of the imagination, pioneer to my work on the Logos, again and again through the magic glass and meditative excess, unity in many, unmeaning, blank in a wilderness of sleep, poor Heartley whirling, drowned soul fleeing, feeling all the talk, half dream, half phantom to actual. Geraldine was talking about living in Sheffield, which isn't really notable for its poetic tradition.  And I think the best known poet who ever lived there was a man called Ebenezer Eliot. He was known as a corn law rhymer. Because most of his work, in fact, his poems dedicated to the abolition of the corn laws, which were a particularly iniquitous tax of the early nineteenth century. Basically a tax on bread. It was a way of ensuring that poor people starved. And it took thirty years of effort by people like Eliot to get it revoked.  Devil's dull son, then doubtful whether man or maltworm, flitting to Sheffield with eight or nine children in a cart. His feelings hammered cold short will snap and fly off. Our corn law rhymer, whose pamphlet, printed by order of the Sheffield mechanics against wilful men, who taxed our cake, and took our cake away. His mouth, his alphabet, whose grindstone and garden, ranter, scavenger, preacher.  Is this famine life of England so lovable, the souls should return? I think we know the answer to that. I'm a lighter, no. I have a great liking for the parson poets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They're quite wonderful. I think they kept poetry alive for about one hundred fifty years. Sort of sat in their rectories writing poetry which nobody's ever read. He's one of my favourites, Charles Turner, who in fact was.
