PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn	0.0	420.64	 You expect to be instructed by instructions, and you don't get very instructed by them. And they're very French in the sense that, you know, it's kind of like French theory. You're like reading along, what? Can you run that by me again? And I liked the way this quote was similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry in math, a symmetrical equation, it's the same in both directions. You go through all of these procedures, and it's the same. So nothing actually happens, but all this stuff happens, and so you start out with the same.  at either end. And I was interested in that idea. So it's a kind of stasis, and then symmetry is a kind of stasis. But it's a kind of quivery stasis that isn't really stasis, because it just then it sort of collapses, and then you have a kind of antistasis. So this quote seemed to do that for me in a way that was interesting. And the only thing that I think that you take from it is a sense of symmetricality and that persistence in the situation. And that relates to my reading of David, which is to say you just have to stare into it and persist. So I was just interested in Nuvo.  It doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote. It seems anti explanatory. And yet it seems kind of to have a nuance to or, you know, a numinous quality to it that I liked. That was very clear informative what you just said. Oh, good. You know, I'm thinking that's wonderful. So things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry? Well, yeah, symmetry, as you point out, symmetry and not symmetry are the same. So symmetry assumes lack of symmetry.  How do you ever get to change? I mean, how does one get how does one how does one think that through so that how can one articulate that statement so that change is so that the fact of change is encompassed? Think of death. Yeah, I know. It's change. I mean, there's there's somebody and I was just in Buffalo and somebody said asking me a question and it was what's your position on change? Do you think change is good or are you against change? And I said it just you way don't have change.  And it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes. And when things are bad, you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change. And when things are good, you don't want things to change because things are good and change will be bad. But you always want something else, so you want change because you think things are going to get better. Things are not going to get better. And it's amazing that we think might as well. That's true. If the newspaper would review them, they'd call them bleak. Well, if you don't think things are bleak, you're not really grasping what's going on.  Yeah. Well, that kind of brings up for me the question of this one might call the social imaginary of using a counting system. For example, David, you've been using ten lines and you're inventing this sort of combinatory twenty cones, ten lines each, various combinations. Is there anything that you attach to of larger social import to the use of that sort?  of counting structure other than merely as a means. No, absolutely. Everyone counts the same. Everyone in this culture counts the same. So, I mean, we're agreed on ten and twenty and how you get there. So, because, well, it's hard to single one book out, but certainly this book was concerned with epistemology and how when the words never mean exactly the same thing for any one of us, nonetheless.  Society is possible with it. So I was looking for things like I was thinking of things like teaching children to read, teaching children to count, and how that is there as some kind of outside to each one of us, although it's inside us. That's why it's outside there. It's inside us here. I could say more about that, but it seems more useful to keep responses to it like a paragraph. When you said everyone counts the same in this culture, I thought, boy, that's way not true. Because I thought you meant No, no, but they should. Some of us are more equal than others. That's right.  Yeah, but that's also, but that's the way you heard that statement is also correct for this book because I believe there's quite a bit about social inequity in this book, although it's not called by the usual terms, just that they because they're limp. Now they're limp, limp after being so long engorged, they are now limp. One of the things that I find really fascinating about this whole process is that it allows me as a reader to watch each of you as a writer cackling.  A not exactly parallel, but the closest thing to it, project in essentially the same space, reading the other's work and then constructing something to say out of that process. And I'm intrigued that both of you, to one degree or another, I would say flirt with narrative in as though it were behind or related to the text, you picking the film that I take it David has not ever seen, even though, you know, which is so symmetrical since the filmmaker has also not seen the film that his film was based on. And I think David does that as well.  Suggesting a narrative he never spells out with funds and marriage and cemeteries and actually never bringing it to the surface but then going back to it on multiple occasions which actually seems closer to the relationship to your text actually and it's relationship and I'm very intrigued at the kind of parallelism.
