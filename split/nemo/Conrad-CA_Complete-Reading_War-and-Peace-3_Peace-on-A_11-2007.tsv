Folded in the days, these surprising moments with you. Look under pain and find me. Of course I still love you. I'm glad you asked. Put on your hunting boots and look at my antlers. I'm a deer. I'm a deer. All right. Oh, that was nice. Oh, that's your phone? Okay. Oh, okay. I sound like a deer dying.  Say it with green paint for the comfort and healing of their wounds. Written after eating only green foods for a day while under the influence of green nail polish on my middle fingers. Not until we're all protected, he said. Not until we're all unprotected, I said. Descent of magnets we come to bank ourselves against. The tomb radiates life without pause. Yes, that's your insurance agent overhead in first class. Cash webs form, water sends instinct home. A switch inside the queen's body stops producing workers to send out a queen.  Empire wants a raise. Right on walls, right on courthouse sidewalks, right on every single mirror you can find, I make holes in Iraqi families every time I pay my taxes. All these centuries later the occupation still unwittingly shapes the resistance. Eruptions at night we only hear to know. Burying dead batteries under the green flag of the desert. It's all quite stunning sealed under reactions. Everybody needs a lover in wartime. Fuck for the dead.  Fuck and love fucking for the dead. After the latest body count, fuck and fuck and fuck the prey are fucking. Run onto the street screaming death down. Terrible vacancies for either hand. Settle into time, settle into missing time, flat on the grass, smoking hash until the butterfly. Hyperapathy? I'm telling you this only once. You're outside your jurisdiction.  In World War one, the number of people who died that were civilians in the war, they estimated it to be ten percent. In World War two, civilian deaths was estimated at fifty percent. In the Vietnam War, civilian deaths was estimated at seventy five percent. With our war now in Iraq, the estimated civilian deaths are ninety percent. And I just recently heard this young man who went AWOL after being in Baghdad for a year in the maritime.  And he was talking at the Quakers meeting house in Philadelphia, and he just sort of glazed over this little topic about all these men that he met in Germany, where he was stationed, who were expatriates. And I asked him at the Q and A to tell us more about that. There are hundreds of American GI's, Iraq war veterans, who come back here after their tour of duty, and they lose it in shopping malls, or grocery stores, or movie theaters, or restaurants that we're not talking about what's going on.  We're not talking about what we're doing. We're not talking about what they've been going through. And they go back to Germany, and they marry German women, and they vow to never come back here again. And it's something I think we need to think about. I think about it a lot. This is by Adonis. He's one of the Tamuzi poets from Beirut. It's just a little poem that I wanted to read. It's called The Beginning of Naming. We have named every place in the name of the sword, and have started to build a moon from chalk, forests from severed heads, and the stars from a night of cadavers.  We have created a kingdom of mere things. So I just wanted to read one more thing, and then I'm finished. This is from a new project that I'm working on. It's a collaboration with Erica Kaufman. I forgot to print out the maneuvers. We have three maneuvers to bring. She writes in Brooklyn, I write in Philadelphia at the same time, and I call her on her cell phone. I have a cell phone, so I call her from a payphone at noon, and then we exchange these two words. But the maneuvers are not this is not documentary poetry. The maneuvers are not the poem. They're just a sort of throwout.  And so the poems are our own, but we do share two words. But I meant to bring the maneuvers, but anyway, I'm just going to read this without them. So this is my poem from the beginning of the series. It's called Tattoos of America's Most Wanted on My Mind. Language is transportation. Reverse plummet from these ray pierced clouds. Watch for steeples, wires, and poles when reentering an upright day. Believe me, Levitation needs no believers waiting for that island to float out.  They know we love our eyes, the photographers. Deposit departed one's key. Listening for color gets us a natural swing. A tree is not a door frame, it's a fact, its own poetry. In the mulch, the root, where original pussy juice, where no one wears someone else's skin, trust this frog and mudslip concoction, stress on the slow, stress on the quiet. Born during the occupation, we'll name her little smothered heart. Hanging around the streets with their cameras and high balls, hoping we've been taking care of our eyes.  Gratitude is a privilege, art is a right. Anger never lost in translation. A blast of paperwork precedes a dead soldier returning home. When this war is over, tenderness will maintain the same distance. It's time to grow up, they'll tell you, when you're a disagreeable character. With everything you have, ignore them. I would rather live in constant disappointment than give my life to cynicism. A huge fuck you to old answers and other waterlogged filthy interpretations. Love has paced out winners long ago. Join, not hammer, just plying and ripping open ducts.
