Well, you know, like, I hope somebody's gonna really think about the landform of the ponds, 'cause I mean, it really could be special. Yeah, true. Technically, you know, the parameters of technical requirements are really wide, you know. So you can have any, as long as you have a volume, you can have any shape in the ponds. Yeah, and the placement of where you put the ponds is really open. So they'd like to be able to walk among the ponds. They're really incredible numbers of birds.  Oh, that'd be true. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Just the place. I mean, you should, the person that thinks of it has to take more like a part. Where? Yeah, there's a part. Yeah, there's a crawl well there. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Where do you got it? Eugene, when when will it be available for public sale? I don't know. I don't know. It's a really good place to be. I guess I'll be able to take next spring. Do you think the bond issue's gonna bad? I don't know. I think the water's gonna bad.  Like an old tax. Anybody have a cigarette? I don't know. I'm just getting to try to get this vision of cigarettes. But yesterday, what happened? There was like a time where at one point, Flowery said, Okay, Joanna. That's your sound. And you can get by tax. So you get a group sound. And then within the group sound, you have like a series of individual things happening. But the group sound is the basis out of which the individual then gets to and that's his ground.  To say that people are kind of not, I mean, they're not thinking to respond, but they do. I mean, for example, if you have, when children grow up, you recognize as a parent, or as a person that's involved with them, that their language and loads of language change with incredible intensity and rapidity. I mean, the fact, for example, when one of my sons was very young, he could, it wasn't that he could learn in the sense, put his mind to, but that he absorbed, let's say, the ability to speak French within, you know, very short time. And then when we shifted to Mallorca, where the people were speaking Mallorcan primarily, he, for example.  six months was out on the street mocking a French tourist with these Mallorcan kids, not as a social attitude, but because now he was in their language habit. And he factually the French friend came to visit and all the Mallorcan kids would dance around him mocking his way of speaking and David among them. And so then this French friend, knowing that he'd seen David six months before in France and an impeccable French, said something to him in French and David had literally forgotten it. So what I'm trying to say is that the that that advent of sounds or modes of speech all the head is like an endless puppy is like a you don't have to try to.  I mean, you're always writing in terms of the quote of the context in which you live, you know, not merely socially or psychologically. Sure. But physically. Yeah, okay. Like a cross in the air, you're writing them there and it's just I'm still back on, like, uh, the actual voicing of it, which is, um, I mean, certainly you've gone, I don't know how many poetry readings, I mean, you must have gone to end with some of them. And they usually they come up, you know, fairly flat and demanding a certain amount of concentration and some for the sound in it. To me personally, I'm just trying to get the feeling like there's like, uh, music is that rock music.  People are aware of like how you can get off the sound and like a poet's now trying to like use part of that is like It's trying to make the tone or the sound of poetry really start to move a lot more than like a translation from the page. It goes too much like that. It goes back from you get it, you write it down and then your voice in an effort to make it come back to life again but the voice like can it's like a reading voice to all of you. And it just sounds like the voice isn't the voice of the person.  I know, so like when Tom could slow down last night. Right. And pull out some of those, I know they must have been ringing through his head in that strange manner. Right. When she really pull out, didn't you have? Didn't you keep part of that team? Yeah. Well, remember, for example, Bobby and I were reading this radio play together about a few days ago and one paradox that she noted. I came out saying, well, what do you think it sounded like since she has the so called professional knowledge of that whole thing? So I was saying, do you think it was okay? I mean, should we just mail it and I don't wanna listen to it again? So, you know, anyhow, she said, yeah, but she and she noted what was curious with her was that.  There's a section of this play in which one of the people speaking is reading production notes for the actual performance of the so called play. And that's part of the play is reading these notes. And the point is that I was I was reading those notes and she said it was funny was that when you were reading those notes you were you were like you sounded like someone not merely reading notes but your voice became very relaxed and personal and actual as though you were reading notes to me. When you were reading the parts that were proposed as conversational interchange those were the parts that went peculiarly stilted and not that you you know fucked them up entirely but those were the parts that didn't sound.  And one again, one damned dilemma as a writer or as a poet more accurately hopefully is that how to get the context to be that intimate in what you're reading so that the voice comes through in that same way. Because reading something is an intimate possibility as opposed to, you know, otherwise. Yeah, well, I realized that you're reading that that it got into that cozy sense. Well, see I would not be just being read to. Yeah. Which is very soothing and relaxing. I love that sense. I suppose one of the real imprints on my own so called consciousness would be the being read to as a kid, which was a beautiful moment. And also the sense which I've always been shy of.  But I've always truly hungered for is the reading where you're reading to four or five six friends. So that the resonances are completely clear, not clear, but they really have a real you know that.
