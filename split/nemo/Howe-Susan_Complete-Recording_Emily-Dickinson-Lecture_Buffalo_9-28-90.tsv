Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90	0.0	538.11	 No, wait a minute. Need to hold it. Wait, are you missing it? No, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's just So, you should say, just look, see what you've got. That's a reverse. It's not a reverse. I know, but see, I'm so messed up. No. No. I believe that that's our first one. No. No. It should say fit her feet of her.  Oh, damn. This is what we have in this, this was the, this was in the broken projector in that order. What have we done? We've done something more than that. All right, well anyway, let's try, I give up. I mean, darn, get what No, see, two are missing. Two are missing. It must, they must have gone down. Okay. Go back. All right, we just got to skip that beautiful palm. I'm sorry.  It's gone. No. Oh, wait a second. That could be the expression. There it is. This is recently being spelled by Amherst. Oh, that's so expressive. Believe me, this is it. Just an unknown thing. Okay, now can you get the one on the other side there? Yes, yes. There. Okay, somehow this is obviously fading fast. So this is a poem continues. It's unusually long for her. Okay, so you open this.  Now, you open the sheet and this is what the situation is on a sheet of, you know, two sides. Okay, but the poem doesn't end till that line. All right. This line at the bottom, here's one of these two line things that to me are very important. Again, I mean, I don't know if she ran out of paper or could she have said, why did she not say, well, I ran out. She does line things up very carefully, but why does she not start? He must pass the crystal angle over on that page and let this.  What decision, where that decision comes, but whatever has happened, you are left with he must pass the crystal angle that obscure her face, which to me is a completely fantastic line of two lines and break. And it's a he now remember her sweet home, her sweet turn to leave the homestead. He must pass the crystal angle that obscure her face. And then up there, he must have achieved in person equal paradise. And then all those variants.  And then that's the end of that poem. But he must pass that the crystal angle is just I can't get to the bottom of that line. It is revelations, obviously, some reference to revelations, but I think that it's very important that there's a cross over the word angle. Now you can go back and figure out in Johnson and show you what should go there, but I don't to me that's not important.  Let me just think now, first, distance be her, oh, distance be her only motion. Is it beautiful? That's another. Now, you see there with these crosses, I don't know, distance be her only motion. Don't you feel that there's some, I don't know, there's some like an accent or something. That's what those crosses are. Yes, that's what I'm thinking. Consistency there. No, I don't think they are. See, I don't think I mean, I think if you're looking for any kind of answer or consistency, you'll never find.  She's again, that's what she's completely against. And that demural, all the things that demure. I mean, a demure woman, but a demure is both refusal and, you know, okay, I will do this. It's two different things. The whosoever, she repeatedly used whoso and whosoever in this classical. And then there's this short poem after it. He has an element of blank. One of my students wrote a really interesting paper on.  on Dickinson's use of blanks, of just blanks in Dickinson. And blanks has been charged things. And I mean, I think that this way of printing the poems and looking at the poems really very much shows, I mean, that's true. And that's really, then I love that new periods of pain. And then day, the word day, because you know, when you're terribly depressed, you wake up and it's another day. It's just another, you know, it seems I think that it's beautiful the way that day is just fitted in at the bottom.  And then the line kind of spreads along after it rather than really under it. The three little crosses at the top were made by someone else, you know, as a marking. Another student, I had this minister who was in my class at Temple this year, and he made this wonderful statement, work of Emily Dickinson is covered with crosses. And I thought that was just gorgeous. And it is. I mean, not only are this covered with these crosses, but it's covered with crossings and crosses that you don't know where you are or what you where you should be.  Anybody want to say anything about any Yeah. They're really, I mean, they're very different and they're not just plain dashes and sometimes commas look like dashes and sometimes the top of T's like up here. This is like these are sort of like seen to continue those. You see what I mean? And then they, when you start really, I don't know how you would add it differently because when you start worrying.  See, how much space she leaves between phones becomes a big to me, it becomes a big issue. And then I wonder, am I just, is this silly? I mean, is it an issue or isn't it an issue? And then, but the worst issue is the dashes. And I just, I think that you are really the way to do it. The ideal way to do Eddie Dickinson would be to put a palm on one side and then a printed transcription on the other side. But I think you would run, you know, you would try to match those dashes in the directional pull the way she does.  I couldn't really anyways, you'd miss something. You could never, you see, you couldn't cross teams like that. And this little mark here, you couldn't think. Well, here's, this is the net, we're sort of like, so much summer is on the, that would be, that would be on the end of this series that I've just been talking about. Have the truth, but they both jammed in. Okay, no, you just don't, I wouldn't dare try anything else. But look at this poem here.  I'm sorry it's so dim now, but look at the cross T's on this one. So much summer, me for showing illegitimate. Illegitimate alone on the line there. With a smile's minute bestowing too exorbitant to the lady with the guinea. This is one of these poems.
