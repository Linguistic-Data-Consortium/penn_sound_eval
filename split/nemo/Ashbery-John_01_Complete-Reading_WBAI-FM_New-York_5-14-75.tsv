Was any of this present, and how could this be, the magic solution of what you are in now, whatever has held you motionless, like this, so long through the dark season, until now the women come out in navy blue, and the worms come out of the compost to die, it is the end of any season, you reading there so accurately, sitting not wanting to be disturbed, as you came from that holy land, what other signs of earth's dependency were upon you, what fixed signs were upon you?  at the crossroads, what lethargy in the avenues, where all is said in a whisper. What tone of voice among the hedges, what tone under the apple trees? The numbered land stretches away, and your house is built in tomorrow, but surely not before the examination of what is right and will befall, not before the census and the writing down of names. Remember you are free to wander away, as from other times, other scenes that were taking place, the history of someone who came too late. The time is ripe now, and the adage is hatching, as the seasons change and tremble. It is finally as though that thing of  monstrous interest were happening in the sky, but the sun is setting and prevents you from seeing it. Out of night the token emerges, its leaves like birds alighting all at once under a tree, taken up and shaken again, put down in weak rage, knowing as the brain does, it can never come about, not here, not yesterday in the past, only in the gap of today filling itself, as emptiness is distributed in the idea of what time it is, when that time is already past. Scheherazade. Unsupported by reasons.  Enigma, water collects in squared stone catch basins. The land is dry. Under it moves the water. Fish live in the wells. The leaves, a concerned green, are scrawled on the light. Bad bindweed and rank ragweed somehow forget to flourish here. An inexhaustible wardrobe has been placed at the disposal of each new occurrence. It can be itself now. Day is almost reluctant to decline, and slowing down opens out new avenues, that don't infringe on space, but are living here with us. Other dreams came and left, while a bank of colored verbs  adjectives was shrinking from the light, to nurse in shade their want of a method. But most of all she loved the particles, the transform objects of the same category into particular ones, each distinct within and apart from its own class. In all this springing up was no hint of a tide, only a pleasant wavering of the air, in which all things seemed present, whether just past or soon to come. It was all invitation. So much the flowers outlined along the night, alleys when few were visible, yet their stories sounded louder than the hum of bug and stick noises that brought up the rear,  trundling it along into a new fact of day. These were meant to be read as any salutation before getting down to business. But they stuck to their guns, and so much was their obstinacy in keeping with the rest, like long flashes of white birds that refuse to die when day does, that none knew the warp which presented this major movement, as a firm digression, a plane that slowly becomes a mountain. So each found himself caught in a net, as a fashion, and all efforts to wriggle free involved him further, inexorably, since all existed there to be told, shot through from border to border,  Here were stones that read as patches of sunlight. There was the story of the grandparents, of the vigorous young champion, the lines once given to another, now restored to the new speaker. Dinners and assemblies, the light in the old home, the secret way the rooms fed into each other, but all was wariness of time watching itself, for nothing in the complex story grew outside. The greatness in the moment of telling stayed unresolved until its wealth of incident, pain mixed with pleasure, faded in the precise moment of bursting into bloom, its growth ecstatic lament.  Some stories survived the dynasty of the builders, but their echo was itself locked in, became anticipation that was only memory, after all, for the possibilities are limited. It is seen at the end that the kind and good are rewarded, that the unjust one is doomed to burn forever around his error, sadder and wiser anyway. Between these extremes, the others muddle through, like us, uncertain, but wearing artlessly their function of minor characters who must be kept in mind. It is we who make this jungle and call it space, naming each root.  each serpent for the sound of the name as it clinks dully against our pleasure, indifference that is pleasure. And what would they be without an audience to restrict the innumerable passes and swipes, restored to good humour as it issues into the impervious evening air? So, in some way, although the arithmetic is incorrect, the balance is restored because it balances, knowing it prevails, and the man who made the same mistake twice is exonerated. The Tomb of Stuart Merrill. Stuart Merrill, incidentally, was a  a nineteenth century American poet who emigrated to France and became one of the French symbolist poets. It is the first soir of March. They have taken the plants away. Martha Hoopel wanted a big Gnossienne hydrangea smelling all over of jicky for her card party. The basement couldn't hold up all that wildness. The petits fours have left. Then up and spake the major. The new conservatism is sitting down beside you. Once when the bus slid out past Place  I caught the lens cover reflection. Lilacs won't make much difference, it said. Otherwise, in Paris, why, you never approve much of my pet remedies. I spoke once of a palliative for piles you wouldn't try or admit to trying any other. Now we live without, or rather we get along without each other. Each of us does live within that conundrum we don't call living, both shut up and open. Can knowledge ever be harmful? How about a mandate? I think of throwing myself on the mercy of the court.
