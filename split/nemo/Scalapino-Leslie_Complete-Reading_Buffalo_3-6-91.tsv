Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91	0.0	345.44	 The desert brush is burning. The cocoon of hammock or sack, which is the henned man, is carried by the boys. They're carrying the rabbed cocoon on poles. The earth before them is cracked. But above it it is lined covered by the heavy sky. They trot on it, sticks. It isn't being dead. The only paradise is not being dead. The henned man is, but the boys aren't. From above the lines and ridges of the brown desert, when one is flying, only when one is flying. It is a waste area, and in one's heart, as with an organ pumping blood, it is illuminated. A barren desert with tracks on it, a track leading to a vast lake.  which is a pale blue from above. If this occurs, it goes into it. At the moment it is seen. I saw it when flying. There is a haze of billows of smoke and ridges. Man who's risen by sycophancy is remembered for no reason as defenses. Yet one is continuing and seeing whatever occurs still. Cocoon's sack in which the henned man is swathed and carried by the boys is occurring. Their walking sticks on the cracks is manual. On a hot day rode in the cab across the city and the cab driver played hymns on the radio while singing a different hymn at the same time in a cracked voice. If he wasn't singing counter to a hymn.  He'd murmur about how we have to believe to it. I had the thought he can't be without this in the city driving, because it's occurring. Occurring is in silence, this hasn't happened before. The grasshopper is invisible, and the man puts his member into it, the halves that aren't seen, in the dark. These men who are cousins are construction workers who are nomads for the joy of it, to have a job so as to leave. It comes from this. This is a way of life in which there are no marriages or connections, though there are children. Catching up to the henned man whose head is hanging out of the sack, flickering head ahead on the desert, it's hanging from the cocoon, swaying on poles on which the stick starving boys are struggling.  There is no minute movement. Laying them out on a mat, dabbed to clean them, though the henned man is the one dead who'd been alive for only an instant and they, who aren't, wrapped him and are moving with him toward the billows of fire on the plain. That are spirals. They are not moving to one of these. The swans flap up honking or whooping as they're coming shimmering in a V on itself, so they're simply the thin topaz air. The desert is crisscrossed with a few roads from above. The man loving celebrities and the wife are in a car that has broken down on one out there. They get out and are standing beside it, which is pushed out and is burning in front of them and there's nothing inside them.  Movement is coming from some black robes blowing with no eye holes that are outside them. The man and the wife who's weeping with the burning car outside them. He's quiet, isn't jeering from inside movement that's in him, standing. The desert is outside them and the moon is. It's out in front of them so that it's in it. Bright moon is in front of them. In the desert that's on fire, the black robes are blowing out on it, not in the line of the spirals. They're going at a trajectory with no movement in them. I want so much to be where I was before I was me. Trying to be in the night as day, pushed out and so it is in the day when it is.  The moon is in front, it is on the plane, the moon is in front of me so that there is nothing in me, yet on the rim the girl spits on me for a flicker. The girl spitting on me, her being so immature that the friends stare at me, creating a conformity to which, if I object, I'm merely self serving, it is invalidated by having occurred in me. To be what I am before I am me, it is pushed out in the moon in front which is before rather than me. Looking at the dog lying in the gutter whose thin layer of sheaf of fat is seen on the ribcage which is open, the friends create this conformity which is limpid, occurring before.  They don't have faces staring. Why did one see them before? They'd say it is self serving to see this and so anticipating. Breathing in and out. The breath is in the moon that is outside in front. It isn't in me. So it doesn't matter if one is walking, it is in the trees that are in the blue sky. Birds go by. So the day is in the night at once. I felt joyful these events happen slowly before me. He's holding the tips of the ribcage like fins and the member put in the end comes. Had been on it. It occurs in the present, but before me. Seeing on the street the blue.  Burnished face banged up, walking. I followed him, who'd been on the garbage. He continues walking ahead. Being outside is simple. It's pushed out there. The tool is completely distorting, and having a feeling highlights that putting a lining under it, walking and is in it. This lovely moon that was out there in the day orbed in front of me, the henned man alive for only an instant, had never been alive, and so the breath is outside without the moon. This stick starving boy's trotting on the desert, carrying the cocoon, as seen in reverse. I couldn't sleep and yet couldn't sit up either.  my eyes closed from being tired and therefore immature. Communal is completely simple being outside, only with the moon in front of me, walking with no one there, is not doing anything what one sees inside. It is moving backwards or turned around, the hen and man alive for only an instant who has never been alive is it, and not being myself riding up the street a while ago, people coming out or standing,
