Yau-John_02_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_2-4-98	0.0	379.11	 wanted to grab my face with the pliers of dirty, of dirt trickling from their lips. I want to be another stumble of flesh glimpsed from a crack in the arcade's newgate facade. Can you see me without remembering my trimmed voice boiling in the cauldrons of rural drive ins, old cars quivering to a fresh line of mattresses ticking in the calcified vortex of ginghams faded dark, scuffed knee scuffed kneecap hand clamp refusals, derelict promises, unbuttoned scratches and sprawled whimpers, parish fandangos perishing before mainspring pouradahs?  A dented hubcap, a hoisted scalp, a tuxedo towel wheeled through a sieve of hoops, this laminated stem, that molasses skeleton, pummeled slot poured into a briefcase jug, lacquered lacquey with a slight tin verb, you know them all by their fame, their loss of glass proximity, these are the citizens whose matching hands are preserved in the corruptions of pearl cement, lost gallopers strapped to a bicycle of dimes. I was fresh from the ancient sewers of Berlin, when I joined the army of fish flopping toward the western citadel of cooling shores.  Lost ghouls we chimed, you are the Ohio overture of our fatal dreams. Inside your propane studio, its slate straps and northern light, a ravaged acne mop licks the vomit off your claws. I squeeze the ointment out of coy poodles, you muddle across the pores and boots of oil soak. A clock erases sod details rusting in the roars of our stiff rising. Phonograph daylight warps any chance for us to strike a splashy tune. Autograph clowns adjust their portable noses, hammer down their electric ties, raise the shades of their puttied hems.  The mold of a famished spire burns in me still, its tarred finger pointing toward the owl eye night. I want to scrape down these trays of crab slivers and molten crumbs, leave the ants to the rocks where they dance and prey. Can you lend me the shaping iron of your frayed stump? Or offer me a slab of cold soliloquy in paint's blackened tongue? Not ham on immaculate dread. I've licked that stout before. Will I ever become the residue of your mature simplicity? I want the sludge to harden into a circular map of my inside skin, the one whose face of  Inconsistencies, never debuts, debuts on the silver screen. Will this feral drain ever be gathered into a crust of intimate incandescence suspended and finally let loose? Angel Atropato twenty two. Elements. The one who says, I did not cross the line you drew in the air. I did not stoop to steal the air you buried in the air.  Had you known it was yours, you might have used it. Had I known it was mine, I might have saved it. Someone speaking into a tape recorder. Someone with a name that sounds like yours. Someone who claims she, or perhaps he, dreamed that they, there must have been two of them, were you, that they had your hair and hands, saw through your eyes, and did the things they did to someone else, someone with the names you wanted for your own. The voice that said, This is my story. This is the only one, and the ones who are in it will never leave the rooms I have erected around their hair.  The one who says, This is the name of the wind that took us through the story that was not yours to tell. The one that held us up to the sun. The one that documented the yearning, the burning of our hair, the clench and stench of our flesh. The one who says, I want to penetrate the plains of smoke between you and your mouth. I want to steal the earthen jar where you store your bones. The ones you used to beat sunlight into metal, moonlight into stone. The one who answers before you begin. The woman you are looking for is a man, and that man is a name. It is the name of the door between you and the tongue you bar.  borrowed from the mouth of the one who is dead, the one whose head is mounted on the pillow beside you, the head which whispers the name you cannot utter, the name you are called by when you are alone in your room and no one is listening, and the hand moving about the pages resembles a turtle dragging its burning house toward the sea, the one who stammers, I lie down beside her dress and cry, the one who answers, Now that you've collected your tears in crystal vials, what will you say to the rainbows of light and their wet walls arching across your desk, what will you write on the inside of your tarnished size?  The one who announces, You will not lift my dress over my head. You will not wear my shirt and shoes. You will not point that camera at me. You will not see me with someone else doing something that has no name. The one who answers back, When will you take off these buttons and swallow them like pills? When will you fill the room with shoelaces of seaweed and salt? And this is angel atropato twenty four. It was early October, a time of gathering insect husks floating on the pools of seaweed.  sleep. We were in an adjacent room, licking the last of summer's slime from our fur, a basket of roses wedged between our teeth. You were going to be the sweetened gum of something more one day. Once you could, a whiff of a chance, but now never is always.
