The tiniest of thoughts and even if he was played by an actor, he should be played by an actor who's never acted before, who's always been more of an introverted type of guy than somebody who loves the limelight. He could be played by Steve McLaughlin, a six foot two young man with beautiful pink and white skin and long, thin muscles.

Through some of the work by the poets who are popular with girls of that age seventeen and chooses a line to start with from one of the poets. Then the poems pretty much write themselves. Steve chooses to use livejournal dot com for Easter's poems because it would have probably been the most popular site for something like it in two thousand three when he was still in junior high school. He starts to enjoy it quite a bit after the first few goes. There's something about playing the role of a physically adult adolescent girl which allows for a long forgotten enjoyment in the composition of emotional amateur poetry. Steve has written scores of these poems by now, sometimes losing track of the division between a parody of precocious sentiment and its reality.  Intelated for her live journal. Using Australia as an example, a diagram of Australia as a graphic maelstrom with illustrative gestures. Resembling a giant piece of a jigsaw puzzle, Australia today dominates this sheet. The name Australia sprawls across it. In this picture In the air, a rectangular box stood lengthwise. It's not the real world of the main map, but it's not some wild fantasy. As of the future. In the air, two Australias, one speckled and one green.  Yellow and tan. Figure four hundred and ten. In a diagram, this looks something like figure four point one one. Figure four point one two. In this future, there are still more humans and still less nature. Making her fist into a fist, holding it aloft and high. Base space, Australia. Moving fist downwards in a gentle arc, and holding it midway through arc. Belief space, Australia. The same motion, but further. Past space, Australia two hundred years ago, louder. Australia is koala and kangaroo and platypus parentheses.  Nature is soft cornucopia in parentheses. In this future. No map, and the fear and the anxiety. Again, not a single remark about the future, but that we are going, we are going fast, going to hell in a handcart, cannot be doubted to the power of seven. Boldly. Why not? Your curiosity piqued. The caption, salt seeps up as the water table rises, degrading the soil and water supply. When deprived of fresh water, trees die. Oh. Isn't this? Two circles diagonal in the air. Now, these open the blended space where emergent structure is developed.  Indicating the first circle? Australia. Indicating the second circle. Belief space. Australia today. No map of this future is needed and the meaning. Don't forget. Clicking and gesturing for punctuation. This is the real text. The spaces are already neuronal assemblies. That is As coactivations. Clicking and gesturing for punctuation. A. Name Sydney. B. Name Perth. Australia vegetation. Boxes list the elements in the mental spaces and name the relevant frames.  Making boxes and pointing to them one by one, using her fingers as arrows. Making the symbols of math. Breathing. In Geographic Talk, confronted with its twelve categories and human induced salinity, as if it hadn't been clear from the moment the reader had finished unfolding the map, with its alarming title Flame Imagery and Matte Black Background. The Purple Floater entitled Feral Control. It's martial imagery of a fox invasion, a rabbit invasion, and the pall of battle smoke hanging. A sigh. Australia under siege.  A big circle in the air is surrounded by smaller ones with connective lines. Making a large arrow pointing upward. Upward float. Making a large arrow pointing upward. Transcript of a dream wherein Lily and I brutally murder an innocent repo man. You are the sound of a dragging angle in someone's femur. You are the sea biscuit of my ocean, a fresh sprig of herbs.  The mystery of my collection, breasts like Hershey's kisses, stomach like a vagina. To my dear dead wife. There was this dump out on the outskirts of town, and we were there. Piles of cars on the horizon. We were hiding from that man, the machine, the excavating mob. We call man, we call man. My wife was very beautiful in the film Days of Heaven, You Throve under the direction of Terence Malek. My wife, my wife, is a beastly dead rat, and how stacked. I hope there will be another girl living here when they find out about me to express a deep, deep, deep baby inside of me.  I want to mow your dull body hair. Then we found him. You hit him in the neck with a microphone stone and then I kicked him with my tongs. He pleaded in his appeals like a tiny Mickey or like a lawyer.

There are in the opening sequence of the show the credits of the show. There are birds represented by palm trees over and over. Why must our music be laurels, olives, and cafes? We teach children by chanting America. Some bodies in my bed.  Somebody's in my car. Somebody's in my choir. By the fire black, I will meet you or by music.
