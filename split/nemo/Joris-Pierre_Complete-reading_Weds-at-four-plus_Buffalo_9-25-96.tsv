The omnium divide into threes, the syntax of all single minded political arrogance.  Caesarec cut or crystic cup, eyes stray, try escape, resistance to stabilist structures, stray bullets, scape soft furry matter, all our ghosts voicing anguish trumped by trigonometry, Idaho release along prevailing outward winds, iodine one hundred thirty one, six million curies, dispose and dilute idiot savants, criminal law, no toehold, a giant sloth around our throats, get rid of image, defense d'affiche, the pleasure of writing physical typographies at the edge of our bodies, incise on bone, the deathbed of the species, my microchip cave, font fonts.  Zoning it in hypertext, precipitate out the terror of the simulacrum, a law of transgression, the only human difference, funny bones, somersault, rub it into the dark round eyes of another lemur morning. eighth lemur morning. Tanits back called her Our Lady of Immediate Consumption, hand held plants, count the dead, the news knoweth not, fernshade, the distant lord overhead, the helicopter levels, fusia your way in opossum for a change, invests the conversation with conquered homologies, as if to avoid prosimian homilies, writing grounds itself and runs to earth.  Here the mocking bird, and written upon strips of white cloth, lapping heads, a desperate run, picking man, moat down outside hotel Beijing, soft furry death, blue balloon in sky neighbour's chain, saw drawers, a bead, we harbour resentment, the bode of language, or anubias, the rhythm is oar, pull, heave, too, languorous validates the season, palm fronts, high hands, the mighty desire, roshash fruit of their demise on Elm Street, careful now, reassert social insertion, vocabulars of homoglossia, a speech defect, can tankers the month, the attempt needs a certain speed, cantilevers against.  What comes to mind, no questions asked this lemma morning. And maybe something there is more space in it. A bit slower. As behooves the occasion, I always try to read the last thing I typed up, so I'll insert that one here now. It's an attempt to.  Misuse, rather than use really an old Arabic form. The Morala cut, which were elegies of one hundred and twenty lines in monorhyme. So I can't do that. So monorhyme is to set them actually against the page on that side. So it's a visual monorhyme. It's a wonderful seven poems of the pre Islamic canon. So this is part of Nomad one. I actually haven't counted the line yet. Stop the.  Quest, young oaks, but second growth, middle aged, shot through with fireflies. There are other ruins, my beloved uncas, the name of every other watering hole, holed up at lake's edge. What name lies behind in English kings and the Christian sacramental imposition? How many weekend visitors have added their ashes to the fire we let die here last year? No moon to night, only the cold distant needle of the stars. They sleep inside their mounds, this tribe of spangled summer semi nomads. We bring our sheets, shed a tear the beloved restaurant name shut Mondays and Tuesdays,  Neither moon nor marsh hold court, we are with the ashes, the oaks, and the ground hugging poison. We do not spare the ribs, eat the pig, drink wine, we do and forget to sing, but piss on the ashes of last year's live fire. In the early AM, I'm all one with the lake lapping its moorings, with rosy ass dawn in late pomo mood. The woods and dead birds echo the truck's sexy swish of tires. North American fatigue put to rest. Land now your stead, steed, Japanese combustion engine, dew wet in the tall grass.  Squat oblong box. Black as what? The cat that doesn't cross the street. Sleek as aerodynamic aesthetics demand a century's end. Mid morning caravan of what passes as and for thought. Dogs howl. Less an argument than a chain of verbs, disparage nouns. The careful concatenation leads to an elsewhere called here and now. You mean to address the yet to be constituted community? Forged vanity of song, sanity of image, scattershot ewes. Neither lion nor bees.  The obvious malefluency fools only itself. Where are you whom I address? Vanquish or vanquished? An old combination lacks the ore of end. A tau wheel of uncommunity, the unavowable thought, threw thought through and in the haze of who knows how. Enjambment saves another day, caravans, atoms into lines of flight.
