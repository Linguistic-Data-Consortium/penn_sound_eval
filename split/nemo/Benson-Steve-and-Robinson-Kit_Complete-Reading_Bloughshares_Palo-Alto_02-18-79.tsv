Strong hat waves, waves motorcycles have anti ravaged, the western basins of the great continental chain. Into pitch darkness the stairs twisted and, top back all one hundred lights, red filters, bobbing high above what I suppose light fog to be. And cold. You don't have any punctuation, but of course it was there when you read. The punctuation was very emphatic. And I just wondered whether what?  Why that is. Well, the thing is, I think I'm sort of when I read it, I feel like I have to improvise it, almost like I have to make it up, and I might read it another time, and the punctuation might be completely different, because most of those lines are linking both forward and back, and so you have to decide when you're reading it to close it at a certain point and then reopen it. But I think all those things are fairly are variable, or a lot of them are. So I can be interrupted at any moment.  The books, yeah, can browse out from there. There's a couple going around here. And so for me, this book is a lot of the writing that I've been doing in the last couple years. So a little bit before then. And I want to read three poems now. She fall down and go boom. The bridge seems too far down to take it. I can't take it. My mind is going. The funeral is so different.  We all go out to dinner and leave her. The corner of the house. A license plate with a word spelled out. Braids. A place we went on our dates. We look out the window and eagerly feed our eyes. Against the landscape. The woods soar from rain. Mess and structure. I sign my John Hancock. I look in the barn for an umbrella. The rain outside. The wind rising and hearing. E uses her pinafores to sweep. Nothing helps me decide. The weekenders arrive. Nobody sleeps in the same bed.  We remind ourselves of thoughts and dreams. We remind ourselves, I can live with that, he says. I reflect on myself then. We walk locked arm in arm. We are out the door then. Nobody sleeps in the same bed. Breakfast is boring and untidy. We remind ourselves of thoughts and dreams. I feel absurd in this makeup.  We remind ourselves, nothing backwards is anything and everything. I can live with that, he says. The fool, I think to myself. I reflect on myself then. Is nothing better? We walk locked arm in arm. We are out the door then. The bridge seems nothing.  A bad case says my mind is going. Crying and shivering remind our wisdom teeth out. A license plate with a boring coke. A place we weekenders eagerly fed our eyes. The buyers keep my hat on structure. The woods use skirts lost in the woods. I signing my look into the barn for hearing. The rain lives out the side. I look around the bruised against on the subway. A high wind in the same bed. We remind ourselves go out to dinner and leave in this makeup. Nothing backwards is the formula eating with that. The fool, I think.  and go on myself then. We walk locked out the door then. Is Tide too far down to make it? He can't take it, my mind is bronchitis. We had our teeth in a corner. Breakfast is into a bar and asks for a word spelled out. The weekenders out the window went on dates. I keep my hat on buying with mess about rising prices. E uses her skirts to sit lost in the soar from rain. I look into the barn for rising John Hancock. We live out helps me decide. Eyes get lost on the place to buy beer. A corner of the sleep.  And the causes thoughts roll. We all go feel absurd in thoughts and dreams. The formula is eating anything and everything. She fall down and on, I think to myself. Out the door walk locked arm in. High tide low bridge seems better. I can't take it my case of says. The time we had our wisdom shivering in ourselves. We walked in and asked for a plate with a word spelled boring and untidy. Looked and fed we went on awry. Elements and buyers soar about rising in the doorway. A weasel sits lost in the woods sore from the woods.  Using her skirts to sweep. The wind rising and signing an umbrella. Nothing helps rain live out the day. We get lost on the look around the corner for a place to buy the landscape. Nobody sleeps in the thoughts of the house. I feel absurd in selves and all go out and leave her. I can live as anything up. I reflect on myself. I think to go boom. We are the door locked arm in arm. I just changed my mind. There was sort of a companion piece with it which I don't have.  This is pretty short, and it's a little essay. It's sort of an attempt at the essay form, but I think it must have been written by one of those methods because it's sort of discontinuous in a way. But I guess it was written in the context of thinking about writing and thinking about writing about writing. And so that seems to be what it's about. And the title is either. The letters are at hand, the sounds look at lines right across the brow. Things want to go into pairs, then a propped up tier, and it goes out staying in the city for this time period.  Very different people wait, listen to talk, the whole time without one knot in their Monday morning hair. Fortunately, one year, everything, and the next year they're naming it. Well, that's correct. At some point, when there are other people around, nobody's going to be there. In shadow, the shadow doesn't show. I just stuffed myself into it. That kind of situation is like the key it makes me laugh.  The year is displaced, heard faintly from a room. The limits brought to bear from an early as well as an earlier age are defined only negatively by a positive assertion of self's acts. How to enter on dream stage, lines down, at least as many voices as there are, eyes for years on both sides, wide open, so to speak, jet noise notwithstanding sudden outbursts of foolish inflated waves. It's the American way.  to come down hard with a thump.
