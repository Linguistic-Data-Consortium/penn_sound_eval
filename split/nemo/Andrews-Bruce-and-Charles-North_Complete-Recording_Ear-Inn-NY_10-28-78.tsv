Gas Station Technological, annoying, miniature asshole of the stars, this is the one that will run you into trouble, but a coin in the right place can do wonders, to be reckoned with on old trips, large as well as small. Beyond night and its labrador retriever, the dim tree well up into the star post, outlined in blossoms compressed to silhouettes, almond, olive.  Orchid mourning glory. Chaucer's a love poem. It occurred to me that I should have shown that eight years ago when I wrote the poem. The title is just Chaucer. Into that society Jeffrey Chaucer was born and he died without seeing it return to the way he knew it, partly through his agency.  One can imagine the sight of the peasants drawn up outside the walls of the city, throwing fear into the hearts of King Richard and his nobles, of which Chaucer was one, and barely escaped with his life after the reprisals that followed hard upon the unwillingness of privilege to dispense with his ornaments. Fortunately, Sir John Festall, then a judge in the courts, was a good friend of Chaucer's, where the poet might not have lived to produce the works he did. As it was, of the one hundred twenty projected tales, Chaucer managed to complete only a handful, and it is on these that his reputation rests.  And when a plague, like a guided missile, struck down half of London, it did so by bypassing the city's chief customs inspector. As Chaucer escaped both the plague and the rebellion of the peasants, so I escaped not knowing you, etcetera., etcetera. Leap you. In the language of the spirit, one of the waist high metal ashtrays is on the ground.  Ah, in the lounge of the spirit. I'm always on the verge of waking up in it as that loop is clearly melting into the sky, the sky in the shoe store, as it hills or boats, and the way out where they paint everything turquoise, the night crowded by stars, people drinking everything in sight, a bus taking air from one city river to another, charmed in the glow of not knowing the ending.  The Brooklynese capital, some cannons for Paul Beaudry, the Asia of New England, the parasol bath, the nose brandisher, Xeno's gold, Zoil cookies, the windy fillet.  The ruby throated massage par, the deflector of the night's june, bowling omelets, the beret of age, the whale cartel, the gloom fingered dawn, the critic of peace, winter's decoder, the zabars of Tuscany, mortality's reiterator, Hudson River wife.  The foot wig lock, B's distraction for the armpit, the second basement of composers. I think that's Chopin. I should check. Never been able to check before. I should check. Yes. Wheat tweezing, the light slurper, the weekend divider.  Race's mood ring. Ambition's green monster. The Smega Convention. Hot Carrier of the Arms. Samuel Greenberg. The Mouse that plucked the sea stallion's aimlessness. The Anglophile of Languages. Wisdom's Tourniquet. The Gravy Supper. The Meadow Contable. Tennis Victims. Sewer Court of Ballet.  The Netherlands of Lips, the Mouth Flounder, the Parasitic Trade, Pam and Jerry's, the Pill Pushing Race, the Fisher for Midnight Oil's Cupid, the Cigarette Pyromaniac, the Mosquito Beach, Sunset's Hamburger Extender, the Burgundy's Capitol, the Gatling Gun of Despair, the Tongue Motel.  You mean your follow. Sexual liquid lunch. The game delayer. The nose coup. The escape from sleep. Livium gesso. The shrub settee. The rum runner's luteal slaughter. The penis code. Bookcase stuffing. The deflator of leisure. The barber's friend. The fried egg ditch. The winter manner.  The cough drop West Home, the Hal Newhouser City, the George Washington Carver of Borden, the Schnitzel of the Alps, the Smellway, and two more. Lines. As Falling and Evening, taken together, are the same thing.  The morning air dents a jar of tulips, and interurban affairs are wasted with a dispatch of elegant theory. The empowerment of leaders begins its arduous journey through permanent display, pink, a parade of points, green, turning out products, linking highway to art to meta abrasive. But the free movement through elevated channels causes the scale to fold, the council to abandon.  King Porter's Stump. If I and I are sleeping, and Paul and the baby are sleeping, and the earth is a wheel on a blanket of emeralds held out at arm's length to locate the smell of gardenia and ingenious honeysuckle, if at the precise moment the north light turns, illuminating the wildly creaking carriage against the east wall, showing the litter of boxes of garden.  Unopened presents, five quilts, etcetera. The paint beginning to peel, cold wind rushing past cold insulation and stopped up there over her head. If then I think the fathers of the world are out of their minds, getting up in unison, leaving warm beds and padding on cold feet past the cold bathroom.
