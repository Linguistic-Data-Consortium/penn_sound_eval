Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_WBAI-Broadcast_Kush_1974	0.0	458.39	 The history of someone who came too late. The time is ripe now, and the adage is hatching, as the seasons change and tremble. It is finally as though that thing of monstrous interest were happening in the sky, but the sun is setting and prevents you from seeing it. Out of night the token emerges, its leaves like birds alighting all at once under a tree, taken up and shaken again, put down in weak rage, knowing as the brain does, it can never come about, not here, not yesterday in the past, only in the gap of today filling itself, as emptiness is  distributed in the idea of what time it is, when that time is already past. Scheherazade Unsupported by reason's enigma, water collects in squared stone catch basins. The land is dry, under it moves the water. Fish live in the wells. The leaves, a concerned green, are sprawled on the light. Bad bindweed and rank ragweed somehow forget to flourish here. An inexhaustible wardrobe has been placed at the disposal of each new occurrence. It can be itself now.  almost reluctant to decline, and slowing down opens out new avenues that don't infringe on space, but are living here with us. Other dreams came and left, while the bank of coloured verbs and adjectives was shrinking from the light, to nurse in shade their want of a method. But most of all she loved the particles, the transform objects of the same category into particular ones, each distinct within and apart from its own class. In all this springing up was no hint of a tide, only a pleasant wavering of the air, in which all things seemed present, whether just past,  or soon to come. It was all invitation. So much the flowers outlined along the night, alleys when few were visible, yet their stories sounded louder than the hum of bug and stick noises that brought up the rear, trundling it along into a new fact of day. These were meant to be read as any salutation before getting down to business, but they stuck to their guns, and so much was their obstinacy in keeping with the rest, like long flashes of white birds that refuse to die when day does, that none knew the warp which presented this major movement as a firm digression, a plane that slowly becomes a  So each found himself caught in a net, as a fashion, and all efforts to wriggle free involved him further, inexorably, since all existed there to be told, shot through from border to border. Here were stones that read as patches of sunlight, there was the story of the grandparents, of the vigorous young champion, the lines once given to another, now restored to the new speaker, dinners and assemblies, the light in the old home, the secret way the rooms fed into each other, but all was weariness of time watching itself, for nothing in the complex story grew outside.  The greatness in the moment of telling stayed unresolved until its wealth of incident, pain mixed with pleasure, faded in the precise moment of bursting into bloom, its growth of static lament. Some stories survived the dynasty of the builders, but their echo was itself locked in, became anticipation that was only memory after all, for the possibilities are limited. It is seen at the end that the kind and good are rewarded, that the unjust one is doomed to burn forever around his error, sadder and wiser.  Anyway. Between these extremes, the others muddle through, like us, uncertain, but wearing artlessly their function of minor characters who must be kept in mind. It is we who make this jungle and call it space, naming each root, each serpent, for the sound of the name as it clinks dully against our pleasure, indifference that is pleasure. And what would they be without an audience to restrict the innumerable passes and swipes, restored to good humour as it issues into the impervious evening air? So in some way, although the arithmetic is incorrect, the balance is incorrect.  is restored because it balances, knowing it prevails, and the man who made the same mistake twice is exonerated. The tomb of Stuart Merrill. Stuart Merrill, incidentally, was a nineteenth century American poet who emigrated to France and became a one of the French symbolist poets. It is the first soir of March. They have taken the plants away. Martha Hoopel wanted a big Gnossian hydrangea.  smelling all over of jicky for her card party, the basement couldn't hold up all that wildness. The petit fours have left. Then up and spake the major. The new conservatism is sitting down beside you. Once when the bus slid out past Place Pereire, I caught the lens cover reflection. Lilacs won't make much difference, it said. Otherwise in Paris, why, you never approve much of my pet remedies. I spoke once of a palliative for piles you wouldn't try or admit to trying any other. Now we live without, or rather we get along without each other.  It does live, within that conundrum we don't call living, both shut up and open. Can knowledge ever be harmful? How about a mandate? I think of throwing myself on the mercy of the court. They are bringing the plants back, one by one, in the interstices of heaven, earth, and to day. I have become attracted to your style. You seem to possess within your work an air of total freedom of expression and imagery, somewhat interesting and puzzling. After I read one of your poems, I am always tempted to read and reread it. It seems that my inexperience holds me back from understanding your meanings.  what it is you do to magnetize your poetry, where the curious reader, always a bit puzzled, comes back for a clearer insight. The canons are falling one by one, including Le Celebre of Paco Belle, the final movement of Franc's sonata for piano and violin. How about a new kind of hermetic conservatism, and suffering withdrawal symptoms of sane? Let's get on with it, but what about the past? Because it only builds up out of fragments. Each evening we walk out to see how they are coming along with the temple. There is an interest in watching how one piece is added to another,  At least it isn't horrible, like being inside a hospital and really finding out what it's like in there. So one is tempted not to include this page in the fragment of our lives, just as its meaning is about to coagulate, in the air around us. Father, son Father, I thought we'd lost you.
