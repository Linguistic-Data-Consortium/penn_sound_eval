Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	0.0	482.22	 Feels like home to me. I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa. Can everybody hear me all right? Okay. I'm going to read in two parts. I'm going to read first from the new book Lars Parkour Psalms, and then I'm going to read some new Amulet Sonnets. So this book, Lars Parkour Psalms, is just out in France, and it's a dual edition in French and English, the separate books, but out at the same time. And in the title, Psalms within Psalms, Alms is in parentheses.  And about parcours, I just wanted to say that it's an activity or practice of moving rapidly, usually through an urban setting, as would a stunt person be moving. And so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks involved in contemplative practice, and just considering the psalm as a poetic form. So beginning with an epigram from Joanne Kaiger, the place we are going is the place we are going.  Place we were before we were born. Psalm undone. Rushing to contain and not complain, what is sung, do this without assault, therefore exist everywhere. I will make a character and one of my characters, not a letter nor a frown, will be undone by a new landscape.  Missive Psalm. How to be truthful to one's woods or were they? Never have seen such a text, sudden eruption, scribes of erudite biddings ask, To whom shall I send my? Vanishing Psalm. I can vanish every minute of every day, but to where shall I go?  Your pleasure is in choosing the vanishing point. If you are accomplished at leaving the world in this manner, at what are you accomplished? Apothecary Psalm. I am so open to you, who do not exist, except in dream. And you always reply, just as I like, from your book of dream. Uninscribed Psalm.  The hours I have forgotten to inscribe are written in silence. Where speech would rather summon air overrun with visitations, the hours belong to no one. We stand or recline to incite them. Obligatory murmuring or rushing words are as nonsensical as refusing to greet your beloved. There is another way.  form which does not appear or cling to the house you cradle. And what is the third way within which appears no argument, meaning all imperatives become transparent, illustrating the argument as a skeleton which impels movement so you don't complain of it or even remember this inner matter as you lift a cup to your lips? Insistence, Psalm. What are you leaving? A body for thoughts of a body?  Incessantly going is a type of insistence and invisible leaning. You walk this way because your legs carry you. You allow yourself to expire because each morning you awaken. Psalm for expectancy. Success is also a sudden barricade from accomplishment. In cities, as elsewhere, we live only so long. I am just a visitor here, speaks the Rebbe.  as to his modest abode, a cot in a single room amid piles of books. This is just a text meaning nothing is recoverable except your recovery. This one I'm dedicating to Lisa. Psalm for conspirators. Conspirators awaken on their pages in cabinets and fences in states of such I have never seen or states I have loved as dearly as delirium.  They key or call variously, where I am taught, they flag, without such pulleys, levers, trance, and delicate nets, I'm lost. Psalm in a foreign language. Jade's is J, my souvenir well, vying festoon, or sacrament tour of the heart, a tout with vines consulting beauty of mesh genomics, armor, or trove as injury, O sorcerers.  O miser, O heroine, this voyage of moon treasons accomfit your taut joint and tankers of fate. Song for monumental. In an airless, airless, airless room, why are we using their definition of success? What is monument, monumental?  Beneath the place of sorrow is another place, so minuscule found, grown larger by minuet. To be presentable is something beneath the scene, seen and seen. How is loss perfect? The lost psalm is not yet internally known. To write it again is to unlatch, to transmit. Any poem is constantly written to verb and not to noun, constantly transmitted and continuously translated. Rapid transit makes us dole.  pulling and dismissing our most.
