That resulted in that little high woolly voice that some people have. You know, older folks are old school teacher, you're ladies, you're old school teacher, man. I don't know, you might describe me something. Oh, this would have been wonderful. Here he is. nineteen twenty eight. One period continued with the Great Law. This is from the Son of Women. What does he say? The Love was never made for man and woman to crack between them. So he loves and loves his sons and loves as he pleases. But there is a great law.  over him, which that is as it is, the wind blowing, the mud spots on the coloured surface, the face reflected in the glass, which as you advance, the features disappear, leaving only the hat. As you draw back, the features return, the tip of the nose, the projection over the eyebrows, the cheekbones, the bulge of the lips, the chin last. So he's playing tricks with his mind all the time. Yeah. Yeah, really put the tricks on the perception. And so that would give him tremendous depth. Whereas everybody else is walking around in a world already solid.  He's dissolving them with all this funny, perceptual subtleties. Yeah. And then trying to write them down. Yeah. I'll make a big, serious portrait of my time. This is twenty eight soon. Yeah. So, to continue the anecdotal aspect of this, um, see, I had a, I did an interview, did wrote the interview off. I get the, the only things I remember were, I kick your eye and the eye of a doctor. The answer to my questions is to give yourself to a doctor on the board.  The fact that he wrote any time in between patients. If he hadn't thought he might in between patients and so in a waiting room and patients coming in and out and he was always ready. Then I wrote it up and the guys from the Labor Labor Patterson Press edited it and chopped it up some very insulting. I wrote up something that was flattering I thought and they cut it and rewrote it and so I was ashamed to send it to him but it was a full page long.  I'll have to go find it again. But I still didn't quite understand what he was up to because I didn't get it. And then that same year he gave a reading at the Museum of Modern Art in nineteen forty eight. So I went to see him at the museum and he read I think he read the pure product of America to go crazy. And I understood that immediately. But the one that really got me that I guess unlocked it all was.  The clouds. The end line at the end of the let me have that. The last, the last verse of the last page of No, I don't have that here. Do you have that here? It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this later.  The last one, but he was on the stage at the Museum of Modern Archery, giving this regular reading. And it's a poem about the imagination, which I was construing as you gotta bring your imagination down to the ground and ground yourself, so to speak, otherwise we get any kind of fantasy monster, monsters of reason, monsters of imagination, irrelevancies, plunging the imagination, plunging on a butterfly, a fizzmayer, a motha. And he ended it, but he ended it with this gesture of butterfly, a fizzmayer, a motha.  Oh, I see he's just talking. His poetry is no different from somebody actually talking for real. And the reason I hadn't been able to read him is that my father's poetry and all the poetry I'd ever read was supposed to be somebody talking not for real or a different style than real conversation. Like it's a sonnet or it's a literary sound or it's a pun on somebody else's poem or it has some stale wash of another poem over it. But this was just absolute straightforward conversation.  I guess, or a declaration of speech, but the poetry was identical with intense fragments of spoken idiom, as you might hear it when I say it yourself. And that was the first time I'd ever heard of such a notion that the poetry could be real, or that reality that there could be somebody talking for real instead of making up a poem like or making up making it up to look good. And I don't know what it was that I could I don't know how if I could even now describe what my idea of poetry was before, except it was supposed I didn't, I just never thought of it.  But it had never occurred to me that it could be identical with actual speech. And once I understood that, then I could start reading him. And I began reading him, and that really blew my mind. Then after that, I think it was he read the pure products that America would go crazy, and that was very moving. Because I finally understood his fifty, I thought about the Arsenal of the Sun of Sky, and we created freezing, which was questionable. And then the interesting thing was when he had to make an imagination of heaven or what he desired, it was a real downturn.  Earth is very common while the imagination is golden rod. Deer going strange after deer going by and feels of stuff. Golden rod and stuff. Somehow it seems to destroy. No one to witness the justice. No one to drive a car. So once I once I got the idea that he was talking for real and then he said something as straightforward as that we gotta eat shit and we wouldn't want that the way we wouldn't.  We are living, it's like we're eating shit instead of desire. That seems really radical to me and amazing that anybody would be seeing anything so interior and frank and realistic, just like you think to yourself when you're alone in bed at night. And somehow that change turned me around completely as far as what poetry was. Just before that I've been writing rhyme first.  Community to Thomas Wyatt. I see that sense of your obviousness that it's not simply a depressed state of mind, but it's a sense that the resources or the determinations of the common world have really been disappointing to put it mildly in the sense that their use has been nothing one had hoped to use to either act to effect and or hope might otherwise might prove the case.  We've just been talking a group of not that comparatively younger, but of undergraduate class rehearsing the political events of the last of yesterday, particularly, and then disposition. For example, Allen had a piece from the Boston Globe which has been doing an intensive investigatory business on the sources of information of the FBI. The FBI had obviously had pulled back from using its own people and covered illegal information.  And apparently it's got a whole sort of almost one wants to say a subculture of eager beavers or voluntary people. Vigilante? Yeah, vigilante groups that are effectively doing the same investigations for all the legal but not constituting federal developments and determinations. Anyhow, we're talking about this and talking about the Sandinistas and could one think of it as simply good guys versus bad guys? Alan had seen the graffiti in the bathroom just a few moments ago that said if you like Cuba, you really love Nicaragua.  I'm saying that, you know, would that the Nicaraguan government would have simply sweetness in life. But in fact, it is a very, you know, it's a very one party government, very determined attitudes, and very real senses of social conduct being either for the camp or against it, so that. Yeah, really, really very determining of social conduct, as I was saying. Then we think of other things of the Israeli palace, the Palestinian business. But I was thinking it's bleak indeed these days. It was obviously bleak in Williams' time, equally to think of what you could propose as a viable.  It's a consequent world for these maginations, and or the practical lives of the young, it's only worth that. I felt that at one time, apologized for these two visits, that the world was not a better place. Yeah, felt that he and his peers had really fucked things up, you didn't use that expression, but that was mid fifties. That was mid fifties. That was mid fifties. Well, he'd been sympathetic to communism a little, I bet. Yeah, well, I think the reason of Russia, you know, you're going to be married, you're married, you're going to paint churches. Yeah, which is good.  He doesn't say pink without, without a relationship. Payoff is, again, this is the time when he writes that poem, so I think it's, I remember it being published in the late forties, or forties in any case, early fifties. There was a chat book that Richard Worth Emerson published called Pink Church. And this was a time when the whole definition of fellow travellers of the pink holes was very active in the public book, Canada, so you hardly write a poem called the pink church. Especially when you said, come on, you communists, so and so members, you know, drunks, surreal.  Is there something there? It said the ends with Milton singing among the rest, like a communist. Yeah, Milton the Enlightener singing among the rest, like a communist. And it's an incredible terrific poem. The pink church is literally a woman's grave, but it's, yeah, he certainly had. Then his good friend Fred Miller was specifically, specifically Marxist. There's always some person in relation to Williams, as Mike Uber years ago pointed out, who's crucial to him as a scientist.  Not as a gopher, but as someone who almost works through to get a ground, much as McDonald's. This angle of McDonald's is actually taken away from him by HDM Bryan. I have to see if there are a couple other little things I remember from other visits. Yeah, here. One was what was his fight with TSLEO? Yeah. He went to a local poetry society like the Ramapho County Poetry Society and their invitation.  at somebody's private house, so he took me along, so we had a meet or a date, and he said we'd be like, okay, so it was just a little, a little small poetry circle from local Jersey, which you'll see. And I asked him, first I asked, was asking him, for a long poem, what kind of rhythm, what kind of rhythm or what kind of first line, what kind of measure for a long poem. He said, all different kinds. It was sort of like in Flanders and more like what he did in Patterson, and what he was doing then in Patterson.  Olson did, which was some rhymes, some prose, some triadic lines, some short, short lines, ballads. But he was saying for a long time in the twentieth century, a great number of different verse forms broken up, you know, like a broken collage rather than a monotonous single verse line. Then I see, what is it, why don't you like this Elliot? What is it? Because he had said, he'd written it, and I said that again to me, that Elliot was such a genius that he'd said multiple American poetry.  twenty years. What do you mean by that? And he said, Not bastards. No, that son of a bitch. He was really angry at him. The only time I saw him in Temporary, that son of a bitch, I met him. And we met a few years ago or something on some occasion, and Elliot came over to him, or they were introduced to me. Oh, doctor Williams, I do so admire your characters. Let's have more of them. Oh, gosh. Characters. Characters, meaning you like the character of the Happy Warrior. Little descriptions of people like the portrait of a lady, you know, the Elliot.  I don't know, portrait of them or Madame Sosasteros or whatever. So I do so admire your character. Let's have more of it. And William said he was so condescending without knowing it and presumptuous and deliberately using all that English stylistics on me when he knew what my interests were that that that he wanted to put my little my poems into the category of Johnsonian character Johnsonian.
