The first funeral tells us this in long hair and soft bodies folding one over another, imagined rain in an unstilled grief. Everywhere in the house, garden beyond it, there is measured time and space, and a calm in the cool stone cool lovers. I, too, move my naked and immense hands and feet through the old high wooden rooms and then out into trees filtering summer sun onto other forms, other statues outdoors, and rest my long arm as in the kiss  on a slab of the unworked stone. There is a raw desire in the cool but sunny day. Thus I find my way back into stone, its certainty. The garden behind the house, its light and shadows on statues bring memory out with them into the brighter, open air. In the museum itself a woman sits sketching a woman lying along her stone bed. On a bench in the bright sunlight a woman lies beside the figure of another reclining like a cat, stretches and sleeps again in the sun. They both look equally alive.  One asleep in flesh, the other eyes closed, awake in stone. I'm going to read a few new things, which you may or may not notice, but they're sort of different because they're, oh, let's see, eighty six. Where are we now? This is twenty ten, so it's sixteen years, right? Huh? twenty four. Thanks, yeah.  Anybody listen to car talk? Yeah, so they told this joke about somebody online and it's at the supermarket and it's like ten items or less. And the person has all these items that he's unloading onto the conveyor belt and the cashier says to him, you know, either you're from MIT, which means you can't read, or you're from Harvard, which means you can't count. Yeah, well. Not from Harvard, but anyway. All right, let me start with my newest piece.  It's a great way to see if a poem works is to read it aloud to people. Now I have to, again, give you some backstory here. There's a film that came out in New York. It appeared at a couple of theaters and it had a short run a few months ago called an unfinished film. The occasion of the film was that some footage from the Warsaw Ghetto was unearthed no one knew about. I'm forgetting the name of this director utterly.  She took this footage and put together this amazing film with voiceover and so on. And so this is a poem about watching that film. Now, let me just tell you, if you don't know about the film, it's not like it's not like the film footage of Therenstadt. And maybe some people don't know what Therenstadt was, but during World War two, the Germans created a fake or a mock, not a fake concentration camp.  filmed everybody there and people looked well fed and they were doing interesting things and they were happy. These were the Jews who had been brought from elsewhere in Europe and placed there. And it was, you know, it was kind of like a propaganda thing, you know. Well, an unfinished film, the person who devised this film had something very different in mind because rather than just have it, well, I mean, I think initially they wanted it, the Germans wanted it to be for publicity, but they kind of went a little too far or they really got too involved because it's clear from the found footage.  And by the way, there's like a second camera and there may have even at certain points been a third camera. So like the second camera will show the first cameramen filming the inhabitants of the ghetto who are being made to act in certain scenes that have been orchestrated. And in fact, one of the cameramen was found and was interviewed for the film. And there are people who survived the Warsaw ghetto who are also they're filmed watching the footage and then making comments about it. And so the scenes are and this is like early in the Warsaw ghetto.  So there are people who have been brought there from all over, you know, and some of these people have more money than others. And, you know, so I mean, you see, you see bodies lying in the street. It's not that the Germans are not trying to show that, but what they decided to do was to show that and then show the way people reacted to that kind of thing. So they'll have people, they'll, they'll do twenty takes of people who are sort of well dressed and also poor people walking around a body that's lying on the sidewalk or a bakery and there's a couple of things in the window and they'll show the, the really raggedy people looking at, looking through the window and then they, they parade.  The well shod Jews in, you know, as if they're going to buy something. And they do the, you know, you see one take after another. So I think what happened, you know, the surmisal is that somebody eventually realized that this film was was a little too revealing. And it does say something about what, you know, perhaps a need to shame people rather than just, you know, kill them, you know. So anyway, this is, this is my poem about that film. And it, I don't know if anybody knows the poetry of Hugh Sydman, but he writes these.  Very terse.
