Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15	0.0	393.12	 As the wallet trembled and bills slid in and out of it, I want that information very much today. Can't have it and this makes me angry. I shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of Avignon on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge. I shall see I shall at last see my complete face reflected not in the water but in the worn stone floor of my bridge. I shall keep to myself. I shall not repeat others' comments about me.  Thank you. Portrait. Well, these are by another guy named John. He was always the first in the class, Ashbury, and I was always the last. Yeah. Portrait, or is it a poor trait? I am a parasite. I lift off the wings of others.  It was cast by the burning of the House of Lords and Commons, eighteen thirty five, by JMW Turner. It's in three parts. At one point in the story, the rain was green and the sky was pink shot through with painfully streaks of mauve and gray. Everyone, including the servants and maids, went onto the veranda and began applauding. It wasn't yet evening. Even those who were on the outside of the narrative, those like us who had no place in the story, were invited to attend this momentous event.  Along the river banks, the fulsome reflections of flowers blossomed in every imaginable hue. Some colors floated slowly toward the sky, like boats ferrying the dead to their destination. Twisted mazes of sparks led the way. It was a celebration, an announcement of dread and joy. We were lost within a swirling storm of seraphic color dripping with the revelations the sky had flung in our faces. That's when it came to our attention that the palace was on fire, but no one dared cross the river and approach its gates.  This was a different story. Its narrative promising that the construction and destruction of civil order would occur naturally, like the weather or the flags flying within it. This is the story none of us were invited to attend unless we already had taken up residence in its chapters, with its stained pages rising toward the fiery ceiling the architect had told them would be blue forever. This is the story that did not invite intervention. two. Just as there are two paintings with many witnesses huddled on the far shore.  There are at least two stories in those who weren't invited to listen to them. This story happened before we met. No one but us remembers it now. Two shadows standing beneath a stone arch, a dark river flowing past. What does it mean to be alone with each other, sharing memories no one else has? Or perhaps this is the story that cannot be addressed, the one that started with and without our consent, the one we are still telling, the one in which we become honorary citizens of a city not yet named. Inhabitants of a small city, a hovel.  As it is, we are spoonfuls of ashes scattered among the day's abominations. We'll never be sure how our voices intersected amidst the pillars constantly being erected for and against prismatic densities by which one is supposed to swear lifelong allegiance. Such alliances seem based on a different astrology than the one guiding us through the night. There is another set of stars in the sky, and we don't know their names or their purpose. That is what is pulling us across the burning lake.  which one of us later told the other, or dreamed of telling the other, as the difference between these two types of flying having dissolved long ago. Each of us lay there thinking, I wish I could say something about the future that will come true. A room, each of us, this is the third section last. A room each of us wanted to erect a story or shelter against the wind that untethered us from everything we tried to hold onto, from concrete notes to abstract ideas. Each of us needed that shaded plateau, that place where centuries were.  On the small shells on which we pretended to sleep, when vast constellations of villainous orthography prowled the land looking for components to evaporate into bursts of fiery laughter, we realized the world was porous and that we were handfuls of sand trickling through its openings into the sea waiting below. How to hold onto ourselves and each other without threatening the seedlings beneath the skin. In the beginning, we told ourselves there was an exit somewhere for us to begin making up what had never happened.  In all likelihood, never would. Later we told each other, in one way or another, that there was a window with a view of paradise. We silently agreed that the window doesn't open because it was never there, but that the shadows of its imprint could be seen on the opposite wall. Some days we sit facing them, trying to decipher their promises, but more often than not, we look the other way, still believing that there's something else.
