Raworth-Tom_Complete-Reading_MFA-Reading-Series_Boise_2-22-13	0.0	468.38	 Shaking it, I look at your watch, which has white Roman numerals on a black face, eye past eye. The magazine trembles at your elbow, and a bright yellow card falls to the floor. Picking it up with my left hand, I read, What you have in your right hand is an umbrella. Note Will the physicist ever explain how time acts in a poetry reading? Strange time freaks attend them, wallowing in seconds becoming hours, hours becoming limping treks across a desert life without water. The poetry has succeeded in becoming almost totally uninteresting, and the only fragment of interest left is that which the colour and smell of gangrene has for a connoisseur.  Over noise. Every second brought beauty before vegetables, before ancestors, thought grew thinner everywhere except in pressed tales, thought that changed, regulated loose connections, losing slices of purity.  As crowded forests of Mars stamped skill with certainty, a bird joined dry bones, a puppet regimed off road people remain afraid, within prisons of perception, without water, all dissipates into noise. Thorhead will solve the mystery of the statues, that wasn't the mystery. True sight of the enemy is not you. Noble journeys into the unmapped. I mean the boredom of a kontiki against Leif Eriksson. Courage and knowledge are not enough. Pleasant butter again.  Why I Am Not a Mathematician. The Dictionary of Real Numbers was designed for researchers who have encountered various numbers computationally and want to know if these numbers have simple form. The book is structured as a reverse handbook of special function values. It lists over one hundred thousand eight digit real numbers in the interval one comma zero that arise as the first eight digits of special values of familiar functions. This book should be of interest to researchers in mathematics. Drone of your own.  Leveraging crowd source data and mining social networks, mice engineered to lack specific genes infected neurons with a virus that inserts a gene which renders them responsive to blue light. Crowd hunters of images. Remains are handled in a culturally sensitive and religiously appropriate manner. Presence without value is perceived as occupation. Today we have commonality of parts. Void between lethality and inaction, marketing ability and current trend.  Perception. Coffee, tobacco, hemp. Plants measure length of night, but not cucumber. Winter stoat in moonlight as we slumber. Where does light speed? Something must be where light arrives, dark over ahead, things darkness made. Freud is tall, Mahler is small. As a very short poem, sound pound four hundred thirty three.  Bird no singing cage. Sharpening aggravation of perception. Whole giant discovery falls heavily outside language, move, dances, evenly those moments, sets, travel away, groundless in area afloat, farm hands of posting, functions not mirror operated, memories smashed to understood. Now we have a poet laureate who's completely unreadable.  And abysmally banal. So she wrote one piece and I could only read it by making an anagram every line. Hymn key right from banana jar by Fanny Furl Coder. Pagantery fever therein has met quotes Tea cakes, mirthless moon enshrouded to a toy eagle. I already over dubbed one high trot barber's verb ere youth woo webb. How Armadafy simonizes his hoe, reckon of her token untamed over ache. Head renting hemp and tints, pull my uptown husk before hot deer. I wholesaled elk huntering, reheating tent sloths, where he dead pound a frowsier wing fuss. Yow. And about how sorority slut.  Your heartbreaking hooter and hoofshank, baldface honkers, Limo. Noisy you, trolling onshin nylon where druid babes call tinhorn. Close the loop on this. Not enough boots on the ground to square the circle. It's a paradigm shift we need to get our heads around. We need to analyse a perfect storm, put lipstick on this pig at the end of the day, put a stake in the ground of our core competency. Hope it's not a strategy to move the needle. This time it's different because the next big thing is the elephant in the room comparing apples to apples. This is just a found poem. New EU plan to stop banks failing.  Queen humbled by Jubilee events. Venus makes rare trek across Sun. Exercise, no help for depression. More body parts found in Canada. Local news, Sussex. Air ambulance crew receive medals. Jubilee beacons are set alight. Leisure centre upgrade completed. Olympic Games. Employ at magics. Images comply. Myopic gleams, gamey polemics. Simply cage on, cage ellipse mom. So gimpy camel, so pigmy camel. Place my gizmo, gyp limos came. Magic mole spy, my magic slope.  My magic poem, slim cagey poem, ogle my scampy, do clammy pies, claim MO pigs can't slimy ego, scan my epilogue, comply agism, email copjims, impale my cogs, commie spygal lags moping mice, and pelissy smog comps me gaily. A cinderton, the book of titles, I don't want to be a writer, the last priest, send the rich to the gulags, grandmother's dangerous garden, bomb paris, wild apparatus, big black and scared, floating and talking, too old.  to be a poet. Not everything on the ground is a chestnut. Bake the cheese. So the Department of Homeland Security had to release that list called the analyst desktop binder of the key words or phrases it uses to troll through the social networks for terrorists. So I thought I'd just use all those words in something obvious.
