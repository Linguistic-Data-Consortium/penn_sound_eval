And in fact, many of them really didn't or don't in a mental space or even in a physical space. And part of what I was up to there was to include the sense of those spaces in wherever I was. And this is something that I've found to be extremely difficult to do under, again, American circumstances.  Very few writers who are able to do this. And I got permission or instruction, permission in the sense of Duncan's permission to enter a meadow through the wonderful work of Etel Adnan, the Lebanese writer, who, as she says, now writes in English and paints in Arabic because essentially she grew up without a language or with many languages. These are things that can be seen as advantages or disadvantages depending on how you look at it.  atmosphere with displaced parents who had several languages, which were not the dominant languages, et cetera, et cetera. She ended up writing in English and somehow placed herself in American English, but brought in all of this experience. And to me, that was something that was very instructive and something that allowed me to try to think about ways in which places could be themselves and not at the same time. Because I think there's a privilege given to place, which I have tried to somehow control.  test at the same time as I invite it and embrace it. So where I am exactly in all of that is extremely difficult. I mean, there have been a number of years in which I've simply worked in translation because I didn't know where I was in terms of where I would begin my language. That's good. I mean, that's a good answer. How about if we read a little bit and then?  Open it up to discussion. Would that work? Yeah? Can I ask you a question first? You certainly may. No, just I'll repeat it. Speak. I'm actually, this is such a simple question. I'm just wondering what you heard that made you say that's my voice. Oh, well, I didn't, I don't, are you asking that of me or of him? I'm asking you, yeah. Oh, okay. This was a question about the answer that you gave. Yeah. Right. Well, voice is a word that is so burdened with voice.  Theoretical, quasi theoretical, poetic, quasi poetic overtones that I did use. It was the specific word I used when I described this before, but I think I want to back up and try and say that a little differently, because the idea of voice can very easily be confused with the idea of a person or poet having a voice, which is a way to eliminate talking about that person's work and style and method and the results thereof and so forth, pretty much, at least in my view, or for me. So in a way, the question is, what did I hear? And was it a sound? Because the first thing it was, was a sound.  It was a sound of a thought, of a way of thinking, okay? So the phrase that I used that you heard me read at the end of Absent Sensorium, we will crush the arrogant kingdom in our days. That's right from the liturgy, essentially. And there are actually many other things in that that are a way of my trying to bring forward the liturgy. Now, the liturgy, I'm going to take two minutes on this. The liturgy is actually a place where it's an anthology.  And the liturgy that is the standard liturgy of the tradition I grew up in, which essentially is conservative Judaism, which means Orthodox Jewish liturgy, translation okay, is a residue of the rabbis around the turn of the common era of the first few centuries. And then again, another layer from the Safed Kabbalah, especially around the Sabbath. All of the liturgy around the Sabbath is from a lot of it is from the sixteenth century, from the town of Safed, where a lot of Iberian Jews wound up.  sort of very intense, mystical and messianic body of thought that finds its way into that. So what I was hearing, I didn't know that actually at that. I mean, the point at which I heard these sounds, I did not know what this stuff was. I didn't understand I was hearing history, or people, individuals, or an anthology. So for me, what I heard was a sound that sounded like the way I would think. And then when I went and started to look into it, and by no means am I a scholar, and I don't like to pass myself off as one, I'm not, thankfully, which means I can stop reading it when I feel like I know it.  If you know what I mean, I don't have the responsibility to be a scholar. But that's what it meant. What it meant for me was to act what it turned out to mean for me was to actually hear a group, a bunch, a succession of people whose individual intellectual work and poetry, because all intellectual work in that group of people, in that historical group, was poured into this. In other words, they weren't doing science. They weren't actually writing secular literary works.  So that this work that they did that was collected in the Midrashim and in the Talmud and so forth is all of their impulses of thought poured into a single vessel, which makes it extremely rich, at least for me. Just to add to that, there's a phrase some of you may be familiar with Nathaniel Mackie's phrase of music as wounded kinship's last resort, which is something that I've come back to again and again. And it's, I think, an amplification of an idea that.
