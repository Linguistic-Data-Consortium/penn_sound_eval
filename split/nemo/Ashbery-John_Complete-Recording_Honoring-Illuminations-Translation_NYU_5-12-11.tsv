For instance, he'll describe the reflection of a pin on an apple, the shadow of a pin on an apple. That got me interested. But what set you to translate him? I mean, was it I know there were some of your translations in Evergreen Review about nineteen sixty two or something like that. Was that on the occasion of Reverend D. died in nineteen sixty, didn't he? sixty, yes. Did that occasion those translations?  I don't remember, but the Mercure de France was interested in I used to know an editor there, Maurice Sallier, and I remember discussing with him how poets in New York, namely Kenneth Coke and Frank O'Hara, were very, very enamored of Rouvier D. He was very interested in this and asked us to write something about him for the Mercure de France, which I believe I did.  I think did. And did the translations, though, come about at that same time, or had you done a number of them for the anthology earlier? Yeah, that was around the same time. I forget exactly why I sent them to Evergreen Review, which took forever to publish them, and I heard didn't really want to. Really? Well, somebody said that they had been in the office.  And evergreen, and my RevoD translations had been spiked, as they say, in offices with other papers file and forget. And somebody had written boring on them. And it was several years after they accepted them that they published. But at that time, they were publishing mainly beat literature, which would be the opposite pole from RevoD. And how about the work of Maksha Kob?  I'm interested in that. I don't remember. I think probably it was Kenneth, whom all blessings, who introduced me, but I really can't remember. It was so long ago, I think I can't remember a time when I didn't read his work. Was it particularly the Cornea Day that? Yeah. And the one about the colony in Brazil, do you remember what the title of that is? In the Cornea Day? Yeah.  I remember the one about Meister Eckhardt, a wonderful poem of his. Yes. And while you were living in France, you'd actually stayed in France, it was mentioned that how you had done some work to supplement your income, you'd done some translation work. I remember seeing a book, I can't remember the author now, but it was a book on Melville by a French writer, and it was published by Grove Press here in your translation. Am I right about that? Was that assigned to you?  signed by Grove Press. And I didn't particularly like the book. So I won't reveal the author's name. He was a professor at the Sorbonne. In fact, I can't remember his name at the moment. I could, probably. But Grove offered me, I think, one hundred fifty dollars to translate this book, which was wonderful if he didn't have any money. And so I made an appointment to see the author, hoping that he would give me his notes.  especially the sources of all the quotations from Melville that were in the book. And he said, Oh, I don't keep any notes. I said, Well, I can't translate Melville into my own English. So I ended up having to buy all of Melville's books, which weren't that easy to find, some of them in Paris at that time. And then flipping through them desperately searching for half of a sentence. It was terrible. Sounds like you lost money on the deal.  And you did a number of sort of police novels, crime novels as well? Two, yes. Oh. That was for Edition Dietice. Did you ever hear of that? That was No, it was Jamaica. A guy named Frederic Dietice, they published mainly trash. And one of them was called The Sex Le Plus. I forget what the word was, but I translated The Deadlier Sex, which was about women.  Of course. And I think that's the title that was chosen. And the other one was that was by a woman writer named Genevieve Montserrand, whom I'm sure is a name that won't ring any bells either. And the other one was by a writer named Noel Vexin, it's called Champagne Obligatoire. And it was about gangster run nightclubs in Montmartre. And in those places, if you were so unlucky as to go into one.  You were forced to buy champagne. It was terrible champagne, but on the menu would read Champagne obligatoire. And so I translated a compulsory champagne, which I thought was a nice title, but they changed that at Dell to Murder in Montmartre. And actually, I think I got about one hundred fifty dollars for each of those, and I never knew whether they were published or not. Some reason I contacted.  GTS actually was a French friend who then moved to New York and I lost touch with him. And so when my friend David Karmani was compiling a bibliography of me a number of years ago.
