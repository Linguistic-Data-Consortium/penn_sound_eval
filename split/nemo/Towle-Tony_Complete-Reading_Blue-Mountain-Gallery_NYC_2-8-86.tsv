Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky is in a playful mood. Over here, he declares, pointing to the croissant, sitting atop what appears to be a raisin, is the extraordinary Pere Lachaise cemetery, with the magnificent Marc Antoine Charpentier far beneath its crust. You will have to imagine the sounds of the Baroque Concertino yourself, if you want to.  No, I think in my best moments I am worthy to nourish the same patch of ground. Or vice versa, he adds with a wink, biting off an end of the croissant, and leaving Charpentier exposed to the close air of the parlor. Any particular baroque composer, I inquire, whose Concertino I am supposed to be imagining? I didn't say the composer had to be baroque, Peter counters airily, only the work. What about Porcini? I had to confess I was stumped. The only composer I knew by that name was a local and rather inept butcher who somewhat resembled the results of his trade. My host, who by this time had finished off both the Pere Lachaise cemetery and the remains of Porcini.  Charpentier was looking particularly sly. What instruments are used in this Concertino by Porcini that you have in mind? I asked carefully. But I could see that I had waited too long, that Tchaikowski had entered the tunnel of self absorption and was already far out of earshot. I will enter the salon of the immortals so, he continued to himself, flinging open the closet with an elegantly melancholy flourish. Staring at the not overly expansive view, he mumbled aloud, I would never have tried to support myself by playing the piano while simultaneously reading a book in a Hamburg Bordello, like my cunningly controversial colleague once did. It was Brahms, if you want to know.  And I know what women are like, too. They're different and I don't understand them. He pointed indecisively at the further wall. See that promontory over there? A beautiful siren used to sit and comb her tasteless mass of tresses. Once I approached and the smell was absolutely horrible, but alas, I will never see her splendid face again. These are earlier, obviously.  Geological time particularly. Historical time. And the allegorical figure of Brooklyn. The allegorical figure of Brooklyn is right here, there, where you're standing. And here's how it works. The lamps go on and we walk through miles of parks. The rain and the sleet are brought on. We travel to Queens for two weeks of vacation. The sun returns, and the grass and farms, the villages of Brooklyn, continue to grow. And the spacious terrace and oily sand of Brooklyn breathe, brought slowly by the figure. And back toward home on the BMT, we smile at the tender.  figure and wave goodbye. North. The direction, not the poet. I didn't know him at the time. The green figures move forward and the objects grow larger. Explorers of the sky, exploring the earth immersed in water. nineteen sixty seven with its fatal look of artificial brevity. Your life as if an illusion putting you near the window and promptly all the winds and currents ruffle the curtains.  Surroundings, a transparent lizard under the leaves and stretching its rubber like plastic across the room, protruding with our European selves, show that we valiantly dig at the earth, poise on the brink of adventure, or blister the flatulent sky. In other words, you are held amused peacefully in the grass, O beautiful arts springing to mind as we are the supreme judges. Or perhaps you have forgotten an important, exaggerated phrase, and your words spread over the stones in a pure grove of the specific, and you speak only the names of the bellowing animals, plants and trees which blind you touch, ships, insects peopling the forest.  etcetera. The labyrinth speaks from its precipice, its outline shoots in a curve through the chemical air, in addition to writing the script. O miracles of divine reaches and words spinning from infancy, and whose business and indispensable references are not known, your story is truly a story to treasure, distilled and toxicant that it is, saying that I am a synonym for the relaxed and drifting universe, a mere summary holding my attention over the thundering firmament.  april twenty fourth. Each year our group holds a ceremony at the grave of some great poet, singing and paying tribute to his memory, to some great poems he has left to be read and remembered. Last spring, Edwin Denby, Kenneth Coke, John Ashbury, Jimmy Schuyler, Kenrad Elmsley, Frank Lima, Bill Burksen, Joe Travolo, Ted Berrigan, Alan Kaplan, Ron Paget, Dick Gallup, Larry Fagin, Peter Sheldall, Joe Brainer, John Jorno, Ann Waldman, Michael Brownstein, Louis Worsh, David Shapiro, and I chartered a bus and went to visit the Hard Crane.  Monument in Cleveland. We returned on april twenty fourth, refreshed, amused, and ready to write. The budding plants and flowers, after their endless absence during the harsh winter, gave us all the feeling of being in love for the first time. That is, after the harsh winter of white snow and cold wandering visions, as the windows rattled in the wind, when the floors creaked in the midst of our pondering memories and complaints, and from when the pitch of a snowy night, the furious wolf, dripping blood from the gaping jar of his mouth, pacing the shells and flames, reminded us of the terrible days of Hart Crane, when people were not as kind.  to poets as they are today. Notes on Velasquez for Irving and Lucy Sandler. My career has been spent as a courtier and as a familiar of the court and the king. I am Velasquez. It is difficult to explain myself. Caravaggio is a buffoon. My six year old son could do better. Ah, yes, Velasquez. When I am admiring his work, I feel this twinge of impatience. There are so many improvements to make. I do not know where to begin. I am Monet.  is hopeless in this miserable century. When Monet comes floating up to our great studio in the sky, I will give him a sound thrashing. Signed Rubens, eighteen sixty two. Plaskis and Rubens were buddies. The sea and the wind.  There is no light and no quiet. Some areas are smaller than others. A shout is not heard at once, but makes a way in leisure to your ear, and in a moment of leisure you hear it with the sound of your voice.
