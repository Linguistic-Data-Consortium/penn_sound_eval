It's a long poem, which is to say a long poem for me, a longish poem. For a long time, what I wanted to do more than anything else was to get poems shorter and shorter and shorter, and then I discovered I was too successful. I stopped writing completely. And silence is great, but I wasn't happy with it. This is the newest poem I have written.  It's a poem which I wrestled with for a long time and put away untouched. And then I was asked very recently if I would contribute to a book intended primarily for children. And this sent me back to this poem again, which is a fairy tale poem. Those of you who know me at all know that one of the overwhelming interests of my life is fairy tales. And for many years I tried to turn my favorite horrific fairy tale, which is called the Juniper Tree, into verse. I was totally unsuccessful at doing this. And I've ended up doing a fairy tale from an altogether different tradition.  I'm happy that I have some Japanese friends in the audience tonight, because this poem is, in fact, a poem based on an old Japanese fairy tale, which is called Momo Taro, or The Beach Boy. I don't know whether any of you here know it, or many of you here know it, but it is a poem which always deeply moved me. Once, many years ago, I was set to learning Japanese under the auspices of the United States Navy, as a matter of fact, and the only thing I read of all the material that we went through in the process of learning Japanese that ever stayed in Japan.  My head was this story. I can still hear going in my head, for instance, the noise that the peach out of which the little boy comes makes as it turns over and over in the river. Domburi, domburi, domburi. I can hear the boy's mother talking to him as she loads him up with kibidongo, millet seed cakes, the best kibidongo in all Japan. And I can hear the animals who stop him. I've forgotten all the military Japanese I ever knew. I can't tell you the word for a battleship or a gun or an emplacement or anything else, but I can probably tell you this story in Japanese.  departed from me, and I've wanted to work it and rework it, and I've tried to find a form for it. And it finally occurred to me, with this you see, it's only one poem I'm going to read, so I have an excuse for a long introduction, right? As I thought about the appropriate form for this poem, I decided I would return to a very ancient and honorable form, very flexible and very beautiful dog rule. This is a poem which is written in dog rule. I dearly love a rhyme, I'll do anything in the world for a rhyme, and I don't much care how fast or how slow I get to it in the line.  to this story which originally had a happy ending. Peach Boy goes out and he goes to the Onigashima, the island of the devils, and he conquers the king of the demons, devils, whatever you call them, monsters, and he comes back home, makes his family happy and he lives happily ever after. But as I wrote this poem, I discovered that the ending of it insisted on changing and I couldn't finish it until I changed the ending. And this finally turned out then to be a poem not only about what I always thought it was about, which is the impossibility of finding a proper name for everything, anything. This is a poem about naming, but it also turned out to be a poem about heroism.  Heroism, an anti heroic poem. And I suppose the reason it became an anti heroic poem is because the language which I learned reading the story of the little peach boy I ended up using on the island of Iwo Jima. And too many bad connotations are connected with it. Anyhow, I think all children always know that the so called happy endings of fairy tales are lies. But they understand that we're courteous enough to lie to them and pretend that we think they believe us when we tell them that everybody lived happily ever after. You'll see nobody lives happily ever after.  This is divided into sections which are the parts of the story. The first part of Momotaro or The Peach Boy then is called The Finding of the Peach. An old wood chopper and his old wife lived in the forest for all of their life and the name of the chopper was chopper and the name of his wife was wife and the name of the days they lived was day and the name of the nights was night. But the name of the sum of them all was pain for they had borne no child to bear their name.  By the bank of the stream, Washing her wash and dreaming her dream, The old woman saw a giant peach Afloat on the water, just out of her reach. Over and over it turned in the sun, Singing a song or humming a hum Dombury, Dombury, reach out your hand What is born in the water may live on the land, What begins as a peach may end as a man, So wet your feet and catch what you can. Like a child she clutched it, clutched at the peach, Something to fondle, or something to eat, Like a child she held it tight to her breast, But knowing no name,  How should he guess what to call it, or what would come next? Peach, she called it, carrying it home to where the old man waited alone. Part two is called the Cutting of the Peach. I'll cut it, said the old man, since cutting was his trade. Let's eat what luck has brought us, why should we be afraid? But his wife was lost in wonder and talk, though not her trade, was what she did, when she was not hanging in a glade their wash, or the wash of others, or mending what was frayed. Hold off, she cried, or let me, who've held it to my breast, draw it.  the knife across its skin as soft as a caress.
