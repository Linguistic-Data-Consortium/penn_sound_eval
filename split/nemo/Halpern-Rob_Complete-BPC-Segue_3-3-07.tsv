Halpern-Rob_Complete-BPC-Segue_3-3-07	0.0	414.13	 A bloodless thing, my dildo stalks the new foe nation. Elections coming. Democracy won't occur before the curfew blackens. Whose diminishing force, elemental skins, organs craving your forsworn illegal touch? They've traced powder in our stools and therein lies the nation's intelligence. A gap instills more fortified lands remain to be cracked, opened, pillaged, traversing starved, ignoble nature.  Now, which headscarves to avoid, what mongrel forms to put to sleep, exchanging sex for chattels at the county seat, waving facts and titles, these heirs go passing for our deeds, exterminate the promise of their thing. But it all gets even creepier still, pumping my disturbance with phonation, days go by, open vowels, not generating much future sound, losses, where all this will have happened, any commonplace strung out on death.  being still produced, disfigure gently now my ratcheted dejecta, his leg becomes my fluted stump, my lip his anal spur, missing tongues insert the word whose shock force grives resistant, salvage, ours, being squandered in advance, we molt in network fibre, having traced the place of future action what can't be named in a field of roots, so come inside my fjord of mannered lights, now watch the eyes peel back, so pasted to the blazing.  Tailbones poking through our faulty huts. Even if you don't like housework, you may still, he says, court tendencies to overdo things sometimes like sucking cock in corporate coffee booths, bunkers, unprotected city parks, remains no civic foundation. Yeah, I like that. Recombining activities to beat the system with money saving coupons we could organize and shop for two or more if we could only share some of this.  He seems sincere and I wasn't thinking anymore about the war or the local hunters who'd love to take us bone fishing any time can really help you unwind.  So the only thing I'll mention before I get underway reading this narrative section called Reconciliation Under Duress is that the word galaxy appears midway through and I'm referring to the car. Where once a history, now these collective fantasies of feeling obtain. Maybe that's all it ever really was, he says, a residual film of imputed consciousness linking skinny necks of land.  Personal reflection, this mutilating gruel. Craven still with his limb in my mouth, siphoning trace nourishment from what particles remain to be negated, this endless operation. Digging deeper still for concrete elements, our loss has been preoccupied. Look how I'm becoming catacomb and worm, he says triumphantly. These recurrent conceits, achievements conditioned by the apparatus itself. Secreting a second film or residue, then becoming nature. That's us inside some.  Currugated flag, waving pictures of the building stones, one hundred little heaps, the girter scrap, as if there were nothing nothing true still lurking here, bits of cellophane, the macadam and tin, what clings to our skin as we cling to this, it's as if each temporal element were replete with its own affirmative moment. Imagining the rumored place, sensing devastation from the fringes of a lake. The time of this conditioning and the terror in this.  So where's this rumored place? he asks. And I'm pointing out beyond the docks, out to rock on the horizon, as if the thing out there were already in here with us, screaming something I'm not doing there, oh there, beneath which all our tenses buckle and our phrases all give way. Unable to document anything but my own mute evacuation, and failing even that, the emergent crowd, in which our aims remain embedded. Grace radiates from my particle.  And I extend this to you for use. Something's reaching back to us from where the event will have taken place, now a bit further, still unable to document anything that's happening, alluding to uneven strata in production, whereby these fissures and coherence through which untimely events to come. But unlike this sense of weakness, our radical need for these endless negations, the fashionable propensity to not to is a formula in the logic of our own inaction, now expressed faithfully.  by the apparatus itself. I is my own little fuck, a little parlor prance, an organ strained through too much concentration.
