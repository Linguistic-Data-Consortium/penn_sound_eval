The first may simply be showing sensitivity to a formal context. The second creates a context. In everyday practice, truths are detected by apprehending cadences. These are confirmed by a kind of subliminal sounding that employs aspects of vision and touch. Charm furthers propagation. They can interrupt or stop anything but true celebration. Celebration, cerebration. Could this have been the first time?  Act of mental freedom. Pierce the membrane between philosophy and poetry, and something starts to leak, then flow. Happiness is always conventional. Irritation, surplus stimulation. Wisdom, does it consist of little more than accepting how long it takes for something to actually happen? If satisfaction is the measure, this is easy to see. Perfection is a kind of surface. Wholeness must be bounded by a shell or skin. To be a unit is to have an outside and an inside.  Place your bets, then laugh, and the game comes to an end so soon. In case you might forget, exaggerate. Adhering to the world by means of glue, ideas are useful mainly when they're wet, but the dry remains fascinate. Reality is like a sea. The world contains many thoughts and few images. Okay, I'm going to read to you.  A few more of these journal selections and then Bruce Andrews is turned. seven thousand one hundred and eighty eight In order to live at the pitch of contemporary life, we acquire the ability to forego the intervals of time that are actually needed to consolidate and make part of ourselves what we have already experienced. Because of the multiplicity of life's possibilities and demands, there is little time for this. Thus, we gradually harden ourselves to accommodate reality and even further forget what it is like to imagine really digesting something.  seven hundred and thirteen. Time out of time. The more I am heard, the more I must resort to silence to be heard. The faster I go, the more stealthily I must move. seven hundred fourteen. The imagination forthrightly encountered can never betray and will always reveal. For this kind of encounter to be open internally, however, is as difficult and consequently as rare as in external encounters. seven hundred eighteen. Life presents itself to us all at once.  All times in its entirety. seven hundred and twenty one. Is it possible to surface unconscious aspects of the identity making mechanism and thereby experience the nexus of the percept coloring process? I think this is done and can be done again and again in new ways by reading and writing poetry. What makes us what we are is determined by what makes us see what we want to see. On a social level, the gradual assertion of the rights of individuals is determined in part by the value the society places on the individual. This value not only determines what a society can do to protect the individual.  But what contributions individuals can make to society? If all individuals are equal, are all individuals then equally expendable? On the other hand, can an individual shed society and thereby transform it? The determination of the value of protecting the individual is also fostered by the concept of genius. It may be that genius is fostered by a mutation of a society's ills with its strengths. Genius has a way of affecting society deeply, although it is always the product of an individual. Another aspect of genius is that it is an idea that returns to all individuals a value by demonstrating that individuals are individuals.  can make a difference in helping reshape society. Just as importantly, the age of machines has intimidated human beings to the extent that they demonstrate the immense potential power of not individualizing equivalents of mass produced parts. Society is tempted to imitate the powerful machine by making its members conform to their ways of producing so uniformly. Of course, the individual soon realizes the value in learning what are the aspects of non reproducibility which are of value. seven hundred twenty six. Anxious, embattled, same thing. seven hundred twenty eight.  So long as a limiting and controlling reality that I'm weary with thinking of it like this. I need new images for time. I am tired of being pushed in front of it like a child being urged to take its first step, or like a pet being dragged along its staccato steps, lurching forward one moment and then seeming to drag on forever, locked in a room, waiting for its chance to get out. I can learn to accept a concept of time that is inexorable, leading to one inescapable outcome, but I can never accept a mechanical view of time that allows for no individual experience. eight hundred seventeen. Every place has its elsewhere.  Not yet completely known, its strange part. We think of the known as the conquistador of the unknown. Two vast terrains, each pitched in darkness, one advancing on the other and the other in grave retreat. Probably a more apropos portrayal, such as may exist between two people, let's say, allows for a more dynamic yet webbed relationship than that. And partly because the two sides are exchanging something vital to both, like a hot potato that neither completely wants, yet neither can completely get rid of either, over time the relationship transforms both. At the boundary point between the two.  There are leaks, clusters of origination, that might erupt briefly but frequently at this peripheral zone, then melt away.
