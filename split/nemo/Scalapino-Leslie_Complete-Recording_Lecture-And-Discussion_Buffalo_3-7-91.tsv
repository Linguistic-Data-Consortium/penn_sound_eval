Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	0.0	548.38	 to a moment or like a moment wanting to like continue it just a little longer as a unified time capsule. A kind of pressing that kind of pressing that Bob was describing as the pressure of O'Hara. Like he wants to have a moment which is kind of big when you read it like on the page. Yeah. But yet as you said before in relation to the poems it like it occurs quickly as a perception but as recorded it seems to somehow want to perceive.  push the limits of what would otherwise be considered a moment. And you also use the expression resonance and duration. I think that that is sort of a kind of a characterization of this mode. Right. Well, it's the conflict between the fact that you can apprehend a huge amount, but you but in order to write that to say it is and the fact that you're unable to write that. It's impossible and also that your perception or your being in the moment, the moment doesn't.  It doesn't exist anyway. So it's attempting to realize that. In other words, that you've completely fabricated this in your sense of the moment. It has never existed and isn't there. So I relate that to that previous question of whether something's being nullified in a sense there is that. It has to be your understanding that you can only exist in the present but you're never in it and that it doesn't exist anyway. So you don't want to be limited by the boundaries of a coherence that itself is.  Right. Well, it's kind of as if if you had the moment as a frame, so to speak, if that made any sense, that you would, the writing will go past, it will kind of go past that boundary, and it will show you that it's past that boundary by being so big or something like that, that it demonstrates that tension of being inside or outside of something. Is it also illusory because it's an example of like what you've been talking about fabricating a sense of the moment or a construct of the moment out of the past, out of what you remember? Is that relevant? Is that relevant to you?  past the moment, you're still writing, that moment is past, you're in a sense remembering something or what it was like when that moment was taking place, which still is not possible. Yes, right, but you would always be it is simply that, but you would always be behind time, even if you're sitting right here. There's no such thing, because if you're in this second, it's already behind you. I'm interested in this whole idea of constructing.  of constructing some kind of linguistic surface or a poem out of the past, out of what's remembered. In a sense, the images like Hera are not nullified because there's still something left over and that is just a sense of what's been constructed out of what he remembers. I'm struggling with it a lot because I'm having a really hard time trying to articulate what I'm thinking about and I have been thinking about this a lot in terms of my work in the poetry of China.  Ashbury, which I think has a lot, which the discussion today of O'Hara's poem has a lot of resonance with. I see him as also constructing this linguistic web and working in like just extended long sentences and that kind of thing, especially in things like the system. But there's still a sense of even though the surface, even though it's highly rotten, rhetorical and superficial, there's still somehow something being remembered into the present of experience.  experiencing that text. And I was wondering if you kind of thought about, I mean, anyway, I mean, this is what, you know, that what I was thinking of anyway is like the work of Ashbury, especially like in his longer, more, you know, more meditative kind of work. So I think it works with O'Hara. Yes. I don't know. But I think actually in both cases, it seems to me, there is this sense of walking down Second Avenue literally wanting to render that present time experience. And the only way to do that is with this enormous background.  And then it becomes about that as well. Yeah, not too late reporting, but I think when we talked about Duncan's sort of Duncan and O'Hara crossed paths in terms of a sense of immediacy or something, I'm afraid I missed it. I didn't quite understand that's what we were talking about. Duncan's not reaching for something that's beyond the sense of its right. Is it impressive as well? Or am I this? Well, I was interpreting this as.  trying to read actual experience and that that is of he would use the vocabulary of saying that is in the heightened sense because actual experience is that. But in other words, it's not something that is removed from one that is in the nature of say of religion which is a doctrine which you learn and which you are distanced from God or you are that and you have to realize that. So you've said it's not platonic reading is God.  as a reflection of something out there rather than the important thing itself. Say that again. I've been thinking about both Duncan and O'Hara in terms of gay identities and poetry and thinking of them very different as interested in this point of intersection that you're talking about. And I've done readings of Duncan in terms of sort of a platonic way wherein experience or the material of what's actually.  going on is not as important as what it suggests in some transcendent realm. And that's always sort of not really work. And I'm sort of interested in more of the idea of hearing this experience. Well, that it's confusing because one doesn't know what transcendent realm or whatever. Because I think what he's trying to do in the HD book is to say, to bring it back to something that where the oneself, where all objects or all beings are the germ of.  What life is and that that is a that's the essence or quintessence of that. It's not abstract. That's what he means by the actual. But then that's so that's what's being read. That's what's being seen. It's the and that's what he means by words like magic or by it's apprehending that aspect of something in the actual being rather than moving it from oneself as a reflection on that as if it were as if more rather than being descriptive.  It's evocative in terms of writing. But that's the whole thing. I mean, it's very difficult to describe that. Just be Duncan, I don't think his impulse or intent is to translate the particularities.
