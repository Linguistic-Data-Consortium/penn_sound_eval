Mary Reinholdt Roberts in nineteen twenty wrote a novel entitled The Bat, which would have faded entirely into obscurity if Bob Cain hadn't watched the movie version of the book and invented his response character, Batman. I've gone through Mary Reinholdt Roberts' original novel, The Bat, and excerpted every sentence that included the words.  The Editor and created a new piece, The Editor, a detective story. A city editor at lunch with a colleague pulled at his cigarette and talked. Oh, for lay off it, will you? said the city editor peevishly. The editor spread out his hands. The editor frowned. The editor was emphatic. The editor laughed grimly. The editor smiled. His companion rose as well, but it was evident that the editor's theory had taken firm hold on his mind. The editor paused in the doorway. Well? said the editor. You won't let it go any further.  Reticently good looking, and well, if inconspicuously clothed and groomed, he by no means seemed the typical detective that the editor had spoken of so scornfully. Cross it over it is either instructions on how to tie a series of neckties, or instructions on how to do something rather more pornographic. Cross it over it, bring it up through it, and then back down. Pull it underneath it into the right. Back through it into the right again, so that it is inside out. Back through it across, from front to right to left. Pull it up through it again, bring it down, through it in front, using both hands, tighten carefully, and draw it.  Cross it over it, bring it around and behind it. Bring it up, pull it through, bring it in front, around front, over from right to left. Again, bringing it up and through, bring it down in front, using both hands, tighten it carefully and draw it up. Start with it under it. Take it over and under it, pull it down and tighten it, take it over to the right, pull it up behind it, bring it through it and tighten it gently. In the nineteen sixties, starting in nineteen sixty three, Roy Lichtenstein did a series of paintings by which he appropriated frames out of comic books.  Comic books, painted those comic book frames in monumental scale and often would have thought balloons and speech bubbles embedded in these paintings. The strange thing is that now he has an extremely litigious estate. Who has actually sought after anyone who uses the same frames he used and has issued cease and desist orders for plagiarism? This is my attempt to steal back my comic book collection from Roy Lichtenstein and consists of all of the text used in all of his paintings in the order.  in which they were painted. It's entitled, I can see the whole room, and there's nobody in it. one. Look, Mickey, I've hooked a big one. Tweet. It's not an engagement ring, is it? I can see the whole room, and there's nobody in it. I'm supposed to report to a mister Bellamy. I wonder what he's like. Knock, knock. two. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  Please. I want to go to my room. Forget it. Forget me. I'm fed up with your kind. Why, Brad, darling, this painting is a masterpiece. My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work. Urf. Flatten, sand fleas, fung. The exhausted soldiers, sleepless for four and five and six days at a time, always hungry for decent chow, suffering from the tropical fungus infections, kept fighting. Taka, taka. As I started clipping a mig's tail, this hot shot jet outfit I'm in will treat me like a vet pilot when I return from my number one winding with a report of Target Destroyed. Brata, tat. That was their mistake, because it gave me more targets than I could shoot at.  Number four, one more to make ace. Brata, ta, ta. Tax. Blam. Take cover. Live ammo. Right now, if they're watching me, they've got to make up their minds whether I don't know they're here and will pass by, letting the outfit be sucked into a trap, or whether I do know they're here and I'm about to fire at them. But where did they come from?
