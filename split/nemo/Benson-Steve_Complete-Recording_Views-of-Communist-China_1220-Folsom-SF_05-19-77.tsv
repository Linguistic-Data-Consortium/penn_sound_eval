Oh yeah yeah I usually I keep them well some of them I keep on the bulletin board there and some I keep like on the door behind like the kitchen door right here leaving it open now so you don't see them but because they're like behind the door like we try I guess what it amounts to is I don't like seeing all I like keep so many of them.  All these movie posters and stuff. Do you save a lot of stuff? No, I throw them away as soon as they're, absolutely. I don't want to have them. Do you save yours? Well, I usually just forget to take them down for about three or four minutes. Yeah. Well, having the door closed so much of the time, I mean, or rather, open, I mean. Like, it's open, so it's up against the wall, so we usually don't even see those things unless we close the door so we can look. Because it's always more convenient to have this door to the back hallway open. So sometimes they do stay up, just because we haven't really been paying any attention, we've been looking in the pin center.  So every once in a while I'd pull them down and try I'd just put the tax back in without the announcements. 'Cause then I figured there'll be more announcements. They'll be coming in soon. Do you have a lot of stuff in your nose sometime? No. Real little. Do what I know what I have here. I don't know. What scent? What scent is that body oil? The body oil is natural.  Yeah, it doesn't say. It's natural because that's the No sense. No sense. Well, it does, it has an oil outer, it's strong ocean. Can I smell? Yeah, please. Natural for what animal? I don't know. Like whatever animal sweated it out in a Frostbite. Peanuts or peanut oil. Smells like peanut oil. It is. It doesn't smell good either. I think Sam's right.  And she whizzed. And I lived all the way to Burleigh, but Do you put things around to see if people will notice them? Oh, yeah. Do they? Absolutely. Sometimes, I mean, a few people come in and they sort of like, if we spend all our time in the kitchen, then they sort of say, No, wait a minute before they leave, and they walk around through the other rooms to see if anything has changed. Do you always stand home with me?  It doesn't take that long. But well, sometimes I'll spend a while. No. How long would it take to do everything? To do everything? At once. Oh. Would it depend on the thoroughness with which you Yeah. At a place. I mean, how far away am I going to move things? Or am I just going to throw everything away and get new stuff? Are you going to put it back in the same place?  I really don't know. It's like, it's a decision which I haven't conceived that very clearly. Why don't we see? Why don't we move everything around and put everything in there? Oh, do you want to? Yeah, you'd have to take a boat out with it, too, if everybody got sick. Do you honey dust your shells too, take everything off, and then dust them in there? No, I usually dust, I push things towards the back, and then I dust around, and then maybe I'll push them forward and dust. Do you ever hear me dust? Yeah, I do. I do. In fact, that was one.  One thing that I did do today. I don't vacuum. I don't vacuum, but I did do a little dusting on a few things. Yeah, times when there wasn't any dust. To me. Times when there was no dust. I haven't noticed. I usually don't notice that there's dust or nothing. Sean. What about the little, the tiny little, tiny messages? Strips of paper. I saw, I couldn't read one very well, but it seemed to say, what do I expect from experience? The one up in the front room there? This is like.  That would Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're seeing those. Well, they are here, aren't they? Sure. Sure. I mean, you're a guy. Yeah. How come you weren't able to notice? I don't know. I mean, I think it has, like, it's some odd feeling that I have, like, that I don't appreciate it enough by myself. That's what I think it has to do with.  Yeah, it's like assuring me that like it's good stuff or that it's a good way to look at stuff or something. And it's yeah, it's like validation or something. And like enjoyment, I mean, I really feel like if somebody came in and they really were interested. It's, I mean, it's some, it's like a performance thing is what it is, I guess. Do you ever feel angry 'cause people don't get it? Does it make it invalid? How about somebody you really wanted to impress and they come in?  I just don't know. They're really not. They're just, you know. What does that mean? Does that lower them in your estimation? I mean, that's sort of like the same question as Jerry, right? I feel like I really try to turn off my feelings about that and like ignore whether like I pretend to myself that I don't really care whether they're interested or not in what's there. And then I pretend that like I wasn't expecting anything about that.
