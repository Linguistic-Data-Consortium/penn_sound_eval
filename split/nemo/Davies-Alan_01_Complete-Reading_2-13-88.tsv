On the surface, he is dealing with the nature of the mystical or the religious. But beneath that, and almost certainly unintentionally, the broader question being asked is, why do we adjectivize at all? How do we come to say that of that? It is in the context of this that he asks, quote, But could I not just as well ask, when I see someone killed, is it simply what I see that makes an impression on me, or does this come with the hypothesis that someone is being killed here? You can see that I leave him with credit for his double interrogative, but I can't help it.  but wonder what it is that makes him experience the difference between what he sees and what he thinks he sees. Now I'll read some newer poems. And some of these were published in Abacus that David mentioned, that was the title of the collection of which was called Riot Now. Some of these I read recently at Saint Mark's.  And some of them I didn't. But again, and like Michael, because tomorrow's Valentine's Day, I tried to pull together some that had something of that about them. And I'm going to read those first. And then if time permits, perhaps I'll read some of the others that have some other things about them. I want to touch your little nipples and put my hand between between your legs. I want to hold you from behind so that your ass feels my cockhead. In the afternoon, I fondly kiss her. And in the evening, repeatedly kiss her neck. I kiss your eyes and all over. I wouldn't kiss anyone.  Instead. In the evening I penetrate her. In the morning we almost go to bed. Desire, affection with an occasion, really. Desire, affection with a location. You strung an incredible tent across an abyss. There is no connection between a cardinal and the infinite number. I want to habituate the filthy poor of this and every other world for no reason. I love you. The world is lewd with your little street tragedies. You always make me think of licking the back of the neck of the proletariat. We'll see if you can get by with this.  Half of what you think you need. It's lust, we'll call it lust. Her poignant breasts, here damaged by description, a vulva. Along the top of the hill the row of shining tepees were one by one set light to. Emboldened by love, so to speak, we came away in her hands. Her eyes took me with arithmetic accuracy, but this is years later in old San Juan, in the heat of the night. Mary Angelica, it is with great pleasure that I introduce you to Reuben and to Miriam. I remember Miriam and Reuben like it was yesterday.  Reuben and Miriam like it was yesterday. Only misses Duke approves. I spend a lot of time thinking about the difference between a zero set and a null set, and I come up with you, shaded African of the Islands. This one has a title, the title is The Idea of Order at Lizard Key. There are a lot of people out there who believe in a God without rightly knowing why. It must be because of the museums. Compare that with some lazy little quiet afternoon bombshell sex in the byways of Queens. That's what I was thinking about tonight.  Lizard Key is a place in a I forget whether it's a novel or a story by JG Ballard. Next time I read here, I'll read that story. To see you in other places, with other men's looks on her faces, I sent her in other places, in other pieces, with other men's licks on your creases. You have an urge to live, I wouldn't think to interrupt. No one comes alone to my house. Comme je taim je taim beaucoup. Je taim je taim je taim too. It's kind of hard to understand if you don't look at it, and especially if you have to rely on my ability.  pronounced French words. But it's obviously come ju tem ju tem book, how I love you, how much I love you very much, or something like that. And then there's kind of a play on words between tam, ti posh, va, ime, meaning you that I love, or whatever, and ju tan, or time. So it's kind of how I love you, I love you very much, I time, I time, and I time too. An hour of this is worth a hundred days. The weather the way it is and thoughts of you the way you are are enough. Your neck is beautiful. The glazed eyes of the happy municipal.  Turn me on, onto you, the long blond alleys. I'll always feel this way about you. Worry your little head about me, Dusty, or if I douche my head where the stars were, but that isn't you. The time when every ounce of my body weighs as much as every other ounce of my body, it's then I think most of you. A series of Valentine's poems wouldn't be complete without some mention of this lustrous society that we live in. This is called capitalism.  The fruits and vegetables are poorer alongside the poorer avenues to the east, but that's okay. There's more cheap beer. The dirt in the glass looks inharmonious and bleak. See what I mean about the adjectives? To anyone who can or cannot see. If it has not been the program, then it has always been the effect of the writing of the Koran, Bible, Torah, and their near accomplices to limit human nature and to do so absolutely. It has similarly been the effect of secular, are there any literatures to repress human nature.  and to have done so by instilling examples of thought and action always somehow so much less than what we might achieve. By appearing to be external to us, literature has been a fabric of pegs against which we jolt, of artificial limits. In the post prehistoric period, in other words, at the beginning of the historic, there may have been a writing of content and event of actions. Nature is the emblem we would pick from that. The civilization of the languages was primarily a process of the opening up of them to the loads of the concepts of time.  in the myths of romantic disillusionment, a period which is just now flapping its flatulent last. Industry was its latest, large motif. The writing and arts which are now starting, lapping the romantic as it were, reflect the beginning of the new age to which everything will be absent, in which pretence will be the genre of everything including desires. Again, space will be the first to empty, time right behind. We're talking about two, three lifetimes.
