In the fall of nineteen ninety seven I moved into a two bedroom flat just up the street from my previous residence, though here everything was different. Now I had one roommate instead of three, which meant I could occupy the living space less anonymously. The reason I at times experienced certainty that I started this book in the summer of nineteen ninety eight is that through the window of this new bedroom I saw my friends.  I was struck by what I thought was an anomaly until I began seeing this type of tree all over that unique city. Within the first few sentences of the novella after that you will find the concrete tree outside my window written quite simply. Years later I would have to rewrite that passage as too many people unfamiliar with the concept concrete tree worried of its incongruous presence. A few months ago I addressed this concern by changing the text to the trees outside my window are the first in a series of architectural leaps intended to beautify this city, these saplings protected by the city.  cylindrical holes of concrete. To those of you who also lived in this great cement city, I apologize for such an overt description, but there are certain things one cannot understand if one has never seen them. For instance, it never snowed in my previous city, the city of the novella, yet today it is late March in my new city, and flurries blow past the window. I have called Cheby to tell her this, and she sputters what what? wrapping her mind around the concept. This is what you do when you are editing, isn't it? You move texts around, you delete something that does not have the anticipated effect on your city.  You write down somewhere that you have deleted that thing, then you put a question mark beside it. How many times have I been thrown into confusion when explaining to someone the cuts I've made, that person being different from the trial reader, and that person has responded with a violent shake of the head, pressing the point, I totally understand that, put it back in. The number of times I have done that matches the number of times I have run to a nearby park, thrown myself on a bench, and fallen over with my head in my lap, my hands scraping the ground with the smallest of smiles on my face. Confusion is a gift, I have always thought.  Similarly, when I am in the midst of an overwhelming sadness, those moods that have no identifiable cause, I begin to marvel over the ability to have such feelings. I write something down, usually on a loose sheet of paper, thinking the feelings too fleeting for my diary, and give that smile again, buried in the typical frown of sadness, because what I have written is beyond me. Eventually one comes to know what belongs in a book one is writing and what does not, and eventually one changes one's mind on all of this. I finish the final version of the novella after that.  Late summer two thousand three, after two extensive rewritings and probably two less intense reworking and countless line and paragraph edits, plus two shelving and one almost utter shredding, and then I ran outside. The relief, I felt, was tremendous, though ultimately short lived. You have finished your novella, I told myself. You have made a place for it. I was in my new city when I said this. I had changed cities because I could not stand to see the demise of my old one, though I was aware that I had been living in its entrails for some time. But I do not think I need to reiterate my reasons for blindness.  myself to that reality. As it goes, I moved, many places at first, then finally settled on this new one. Why am I here? I asked myself, walking among its thousands of ghosts. I could not find an answer, but in the interim I met a girl and became enamored with her, she will be referred to as M. I showed the novella to M once she had read my other work, and upon finishing it, she said, Hmm, studying me. We were in a very large park. I think she turned her head to see if this park mirrored the one referred to in the novel. I didn't write it here, I explained it to her.  To believe me, well, people will think what they want, it is their right, I suppose, but after that could never have been written in this city. I wrote it in a place of perpetual sun, a place that never rose above thirty degrees Celsius, I've given up Fahrenheit in protest of the government, and never sank below ten, a place of crowds that did not overwhelm one as they do here, a place whose incomparable ease explains the near flatness of the writing, this flatness which I could never alter and always haunted me. That first summer in my new city, the sensation of my own flatness was very strong. With Em in the park.  I was struck by the persistence of it. This feeling, which I thought I had rid myself of by simply maturing as a person, had never left me. It had just taken on another form, manifesting itself differently, yet deeper with every subsequent book. It strikes often at the end of the day when I am reviewing some work I have just written, and I find myself thinking that it is not writing that I have done, it is speech or error, plain error, it is zero, it is a gesture, a sign, an indication of writing, but not writing, not at all writing.
