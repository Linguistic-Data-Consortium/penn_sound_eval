I saw the Iscapades, the Harlem Globetrotters, Cassius Clay fight Sonny Liston, the Beatles at the Deauville, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, the Dave Clark five, Sonny and Cher, the Rolling Stones, the Fleetwoods, the Diamonds, the Temptations, Little Anthony, and the Imperials. I had a microscope, chemistry set, rock collection, shell collection, stamp collection, black light incense burner,  Model of a Spanish galleon, replica of a Bowie knife. You see what I mean? I drove a country squire wagon, Grand Prix, Fiat Spider. I'm enjoying it. I'm getting into it. My brother, I like it. Let's get that on tape. My brother drove an Austin Healy convertible. I had a leather jacket, play clothes, school clothes, dress clothes. My father wore silk ties, silk suits, Italian shoes. Mother wore French fashions, mink stalls.
