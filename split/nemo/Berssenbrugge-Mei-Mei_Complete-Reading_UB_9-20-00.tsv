A girl sings alone without knowing the words and enters your memory. That there's no present of what will happen to her is your expectation. Everyone becomes great in proportion to a singer's furious expectations, like so many good mistakes.  Parachute on the desert blue with light. Eleven sheep head to head in a circle asleep. Enjoyment and substance in real time involve clearings about which pivot opaque zones. Real is a span of visibility inasmuch as your flesh is not chaotic of a contingency. The real thing substitutes for another who's not representable as he gathers up.  Parachute and delivery. If I stay here and you mean something, the part in common is disjunct from what you mean, like my hands touching. That you're telepathic means nothing, you facts you can't know, which still work in the connections of my experience. A rock in rain distributing water along texture is my response to experience, inasmuch as your flesh is an invisible interplay of disjunction needed.  Flesh is texture. Our meeting occurs near a hill you climb every day to water transplanted iris. Why don't you let others do that? Although I do not wish to separate from him now, due to faults of compound phenomena being demonstrated, it seems he will disappear from my sight and hearing. The beauty of his song derives from the fact.  It represents something to someone. Any family that's concentrated in so far as it represents something may be taken for someone. Wherever there's waiting is this transference. The danger is you'll be deceived by the metonymy of my tender feeling so light and multiple. You go to pick up the child after school. You remain a few moments talking with a teacher beside the loom.  Why are you telling her this? Glory, formless substance, circular dawn. Like a child's drawing of stars or snowflakes and lines. Each line connects, so it's the same star falling loop to loop, and each line belongs to each star. My friend the white rabbit, little mouse, squirrel, impatient, shaking off their clothes.  I wanted to write a poem for a long time about the fertile area of the margin but then when I wrote it it was called Nest and it's in five parts.  My mother tongue Chinese has an immemorial history before me. I was inserted into it a motive for my language. I learned it naturally, filling it with intentions, and will leave it without intent for other children. My mother and I speak a local language, and sometimes our mother tongue.  my dream with its intent. What to intend in changing the mother tongue of my daughter? Compassion not being ill, sleep in which she resonates depth like a bell. Loving the wind is equivalent to intention as rhetorical surface, like writing a diary on her skin. Non comprehension tips ambivalent matter, as if there were two of us here.  One is Kwanyin, one is mother tongue. Her matter inserted, emotive, is always somewhere else, exiting one language, another without intent, translated as heart. I want to tell you what's difficult to admit that I left home. Change of mother tongue between us activates an immune system, margin where dwelling and travel.  The artifacts throw themselves toward light without becoming signification. Telling you is not an edge of the light. There's no margin of a shadow to imply interior. In my childhood house was a deep porch covered with vines. Look past our silhouette to silhouettes like shadows of guests arriving in the bright yard. Light in the next room falls on her as she bends.  to kiss you. Skylight pours down then covers the mud wall like cloth. I observe the lighted feel that seems to hang in space in front of me. Speaking not filling in a surface intent is like a cabinet of artifacts, comparison coexisting with incongruity. My origin is a linguistic surface like a decorated wall.  No little houses at dusk, yellow lights coming on, physical, mute. Its significance is received outside hearing, decorating simply by opening the view. Wherever I look is prior absence, no figure, ruin escaping anaesthetic. Hammock, electric, fan, ghost don't qualify as guards. The comfortable interior my guest inhabits is a moving base, states of dwelling that are undeclared.  Woes crosshatched like mother tongue. A foreign woman occupies a home that's impersonal like the nest of a parasite. Its value is contentless but photographable in the context of an indigenous population, tipping between physical ease and the freedom of animals accumulating risk. When the scene is complex, I turn to the audience and comment out loud, then return to the room and language at hand, weakened by whoever didn't hear me.  As if I don't recognize the room, because my family moved in while I was away. As text implicated, with outside the wall is waves. So I decorate in new mother tongue.
