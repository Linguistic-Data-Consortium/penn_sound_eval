But you could you'll be able to see like the glass rim of the vice president, just the corner of the glasses of the vice president, for instance, Alfonso Guerra, who is like Cardinal Richelieu. He's like a power in the shadow.  Or the sideburn of the prime minister, you know, that was very funny because when he was elected, he was still fairly young. He was in his early forties. And then overnight, his sideburns went white because, you know, there's a little sense of respectability and, you know, like patina of experience or whatever, you know, so that may be another one. Then you may see in another picture the earring of Franco's granddaughter, you know, who's married to a French antique dealer. Or the smile.  It sounds like a Gioconda smile of Isabel Presler, who is a notorious, a glorified courtesan that has been married first to a pop singer, Julio Iglesias, who was her first husband, then she married a count, and then she married Boyer, who at the time was like a superminister, he was the Minister of Economics and Finances, and probably the most powerful minister in Spain at the time, but the socialist government.  maneuvers herself into associating herself with, you know, the most powerful men at the moment. And so there's this The smile, because she has this really like the Gioconda smile, you know, she looks like a porcelain doll, she comes from a Philippine family, you know, from that time when the Philippines were a Spanish dominion and all that. And he's very cold and very elegant and but at the same time it's just pure slack, you know. Because that's another thing that has happened in Spain is that the politics and and commerce.  culture and the tabloid culture has all become completely mixed, indiscriminately mixed. But it's even more there. It's really amazing. I mean, you would buy a magazine that would be the equivalent of Time magazine or Newsweek, and it's just appalling, because at least these magazines, American magazines, that they may be biased, and you can read very clearly between the lines, where their ideology is and everything. But they still talk about serious issues, at least the main features, whatever happens in Newsweek.  You know, there's one international part that they may, you know, talk about, whatever. And then the national, you know, affairs and so on. But it never gets as low as what the Spanish magazines are doing right now. And they claim that they have to do that because otherwise people don't buy them. But, I mean, it's like they go to the point of telling you who's sleeping with what? With whom? You know, in the cover. I mean, you know, whose mistress is, you know, a science cell and it's just amazing, you know. I have like the national enquirer across Oh, yes. But the point is that, you know, it's not the national enquirer.  It's supposed to be Newsweek. And that's one part of the other part of it is the socialist government in an attempt to associate themselves with the most progressive and stylish and visible structures of society. They like to hang out with artists and singers and pop singers. So again, that also has helped that sort of not having a clear boundary where the party ends and the real serious business beginner after the Great Divine.  I mean, his whole thesis is that that's the signal of that's postmodernism. I mean, modernism was this division between high and low, and postmodernism was a lot of disintegration for that. I should I want to have you talk about what's going to happen in Cambridge. It's okay, honestly. I could always have it. And what I mean, the nineteen eighty nine Whitney biennial.  Controversy. Were you surprised by the controversy completely? I mean, I was blind that you didn't. Yeah. I was getting ready to fight a good one in Indianapolis. Because I thought that that was going to really do make a big stink. And nothing happened. It didn't happen. And the backyard, totally unexpectedly, then the thing just blew up in my face. And it was a total surprise in New York. Something like this was.  Do you, and I mean, as I said before, I thought that there were, had there been any long term effects from, I mean, I don't know what they would be. As usual in those kind of situations, you got a lot of actual free publicity, but more people found out about the beast than women found out about if that would happen. It's a double edged thing, because at one point I had to actually, you know, tell the reporters when they called.  That if they were only interested in the, you know, all the big scandal and everything, the fact that, you know, the two museums, actually three museums were, you know, involved in the whole thing. And they only wanted there to lean in, there wasn't interested, you know, that they were only going to get my, my side of the, of the story if they were going to, to talk about the piece, what the content was and, and to read the work, you know, the other thing is, I mean, you know, another kind of appropriation, every time you saw the image in these articles about the controversy, there was never the whole image. No, they didn't never include the screen.
