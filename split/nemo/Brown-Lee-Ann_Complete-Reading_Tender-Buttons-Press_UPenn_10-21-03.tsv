In fact, I was obsessing on what it would be in the big birthday book. You almost made the day of eccentricity along with Emily D, but you passed that over for the day of abandon. Total freedom same sign as Chanade O'Connor, Mary Queen of Scots, Jim Morrison, Flip Wilson, Alter Ego, Geraldine, whom your grandmother of the same name was reported to have loved, and others of wild nature unable to be contained. You were also born in the year of the horse, and as a Sagittarius you are a double horsey ready to run and travel free, but I hope you'll stick close by me for a while, because I love it.  And even though last month you supposedly finally figured out we are separate bodies and identities, you were your own self from the beginning, a focused discerning light, so calm for a baby. You did cry, though not as often as most we hear, and you did not have that choler or colic, but are of the undeniably sweet disposition. Anyway, as I was saying, I love you close by me, and when we are together in bed, you nursing in the crook of my arm, I can imagine you are still attached to me as you were in the inside, and your fine, smooth body, exceptionally fat, fair, and pure, is covered with fine patina of sweat. It is like you are still swimming in me.  One time when you were kicking up a storm so strong in Vienna, when I was walking one night to catch the tram to meet your father, you kicked such a complex rhythm that I had to stop walking in order to process the polyphony. I noticed these couplets line are growing longer and longer. It's because I have so much to say to you and the headlong rush seems the way to go if I am to attempt to catch up in all the varied strands of thought and experience that have transpired since your birth, making everything richer and more layered. I even had the feeling yesterday that you had always been here, even though you've only been outside a little over half a year. Maybe you were always there in eternity or infinity. You met Destiny on the street the other day.  And I said, Destiny, meet reality. And reality, meet destiny. And Destiny's mother laughed and told her friend how I looked around when she was calling out down Eighth Avenue, Destiny, destiny. So many little happenings since you were born. And before now that art and life seem even more enmeshed, think I'll go take a swim with you and your dad now in the L shaped pool with you and your bright pink swim diapers given to us unused by Stella. So many lovely hand me downs and new things too. I had to work up to that one.  I'll just do a few from this, and India is going to read some of the three hundred and fifteen project that she worked on. I wanted to read a piece of mine. It's an interesting project that Bernadette Mayer is another inspiration to us that Laney referenced earlier, and she's also a way that Stein comes into this generation. She taught us a lot about Gertrude Stein's sort of conceptual ideas with the sentence and her play. But the three hundred fifteen project is a bunch of people writing every August at three hundred fifteen in the morning.  I did it the very first year, I think it was ' ninety three or something like that. So if you ever want to join it, there's a website I think you can join up to do the three hundred fifteen project. But this is the only thing I saved from this book out of that, and then the whole thing was published in their place. But this is Definitions at three hundred fifteen. Poetry. A condensed form of food and time. Voice. My speech, babe. Brain. A reign in B. Boat. Toybot. A TED DET.  Sun in a squeegee. Modesty. The ruined package. Discourse. Talking fancy without much to drink. And I'll just do a very short sample from this new book. All right, before I forget, the Tinder Buttons books that are here tonight. Indias and Laney's. I wanted, you know, if you want to pick them up, we'll give a special deal tonight. So please, they're usually like eleven dollars ninety five cents. We'll give them two dollars for ten bucks or seven dollars each if you want just one. So I want to say that before I forget. We brought them down from New York.  with you and put them on your bedside. Another thing I like about, you know, Laney's work is the work with the botanical language, the language of flowers and of seeds and botany and science. And I did a lot of work with that. And then, of course, I was attracted to India's work with sleep as a sort of transformative state. And we both use those in our work. So I think that's one of the common threads. And I wanted to read two poems that sort of link up with that. So Encyclopaedia Botanica, or this is sort of a title of my book, or a mother to be's book of meltdowns.  anticipation and scientific renderings of organic and theoretical forms, such as the way flowers lie in the bud. A permutational cento of centos, consisting of painful ensuflations, multiple estivations, the calculus of various inflorescence, my naive set theories as unordered pairs, vibratory odes in all manner of cross pollinating color, illumined spores, and how they grow in corkscrew contortion, all imbued with entire new electric libraries of the body. Herein find random factors of the strange attraction to hard science, but also to soften it.  Previously failed materials and pickup works, illuminated maps of misreading, specifically a trace study of my own peculiar vocabulary living in the dictionary.
