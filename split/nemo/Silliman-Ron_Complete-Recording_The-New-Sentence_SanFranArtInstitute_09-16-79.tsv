These are actually fairly important. five point one sequential sentences generated from compound ones. These sentences commonly begin with conjunctions such as and then went down to the chips. Marginal sentences generated from complex ones. In this two sentence paragraph from Plasma, the second sentence is of the marginal type. They blew the whole thing up and were presented with a fragment, an obvious mistake.  three elliptical sentences generated from simple ones, such as new mayor, no conflicts. And then non elliptical sentences with no clause structure, such as yes, no, or revolving door. There also exist four types of situations in tagmatic analysis, which also generate minor sentence types. Now the breakdown in the works I've read seems to me fairly arbitrary and in need of greater work. These are additions to statements, responses to questions, exclamations, and finally vocatives, greetings, calls, titles, and mottoes.  such as the Dodge Boys. The next question is how do sentences integrate the higher order units of meaning? The obvious first step here is toward the paragraph. And here I want to quote Valishinov one last time. In certain crucial respects, paragraphs are analogues to exchanges in dialogue. The paragraph is something like a vitiated dialogue worked in the body of a monologic utterance. Behind the device of partitioning speech into units, which are termed paragraphs in their written form, lie orientation toward listener or reader and calculation of the latter's possible reactions.  The weaker this orientation and calculation are, the less organized as regards paragraphs our speech will be. This classic these classic types of paragraphs are question and answer, where the question is posed and answer given by the same author, supplementation, anticipation of possible objections, the type cited in Willich and Warren, exposition of seeming discrepancies or illegicalities in one's own argument, and so forth. Very often we make our own speech or part of it the object of discussion. In such a case, a shift occurs in the speaker's attention from the reference of his speech to the speech itself.  reflection over one's own words. But even this shift in verbal intention is conditioned by the addressee's interest. If we could imagine speech that absolutely ignored the addressee, an impossible kind of speech, of course, we would have a case of speech with organic partition reduced to the minimum. Needless to say, we are not thinking here of certain special types of partition shaped by the particular aims and purposes of specific ideological fields, for instance, the strophic partition of speech and verse, or the purely logical partition of speech of the type premise conclusion, thesis, antithesis, and the like.  But we are, of course, thinking of exactly such things here. And I want to point out that the thing, the partitioning of paragraphs, the idea of a paragraph as a vitiated dialogue is something that is not radically different from the strategies you see in the work of David Brommage's essay poems, My Poetry and others. And David Anton, when he gave a talk over to Eddie Langdon Street, actually described his own work in exactly Evolutiono's terms as a vitiated dialogue. Rossi Landi, an Italian semiatician, focuses on that problem a little more closely. He suggests that the model of the above sentence.  Integration is classically the syllogism, such as in all women were once girls, and some women are lawyers, some lawyers are women. Logically, these lead to a third sentence or conclusion, a higher level of meaning, some lawyers were once girls. Literature precedes by the suppression most often of this third sentence, positing instead chains on the order of the first two. For example, here's plasma again. He thought they were a family unit. There were seven men and four women and thirteen children in the house. Which voice was he going to record? But this integration.  This assumption that all three of these statements are interrelated and, in fact, one would create higher orders of presumption about it is, in fact, just a presumption. In the next paragraph in Plasma, Watton plays with the reader's recognition of that presumptiveness. That's why we talk language. Back in Sephala, I'm writing this down, wallowing in a soft leather armchair. A dead dog lies in the gutter, his feet in the air. That third sentence has not much to do with the previous two. And the assumption that this is why we talk language is, again, the sort of thing that you can only integrate with the previous sentence.  By making that what I'm going to continue calling a syllogistic leap or a syllogistic movement above the level of the sentence. Two paragraphs before, the separation of the sentences in plasma is so large as to suppress the integration of sentences altogether. The burden of classes is the twentieth century career. He can be incredibly cruel. Events are advancing at a terrifying rate. Rossi Landi also gives us a final means of looking at the importance of the role of the sentence. In his work Linguistics and Economics, he argues a homology that language use arises from the need to divide the work in the community.  that the elaboration of language systems and labor production, up to and including all social production, are essentially identical. In this point of view, a completed tool is a sentence. A hammer, for example, consists of a face, a handle, and a cleaner claw. Without the presence of all three, hammers don't function. Sentences relate to their clauses in just the same way. Richard Stein disagreed with that. Only the manufacturer of hammers would have any use for disconnected handles.
