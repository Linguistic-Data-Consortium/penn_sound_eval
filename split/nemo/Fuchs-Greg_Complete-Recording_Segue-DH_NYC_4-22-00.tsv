Fuchs-Greg_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_4-22-00	0.0	379.05	 The low rumble of an oncoming train, traffic overhead. Three people sniffling. Who is the male half of People's Couple of the Year? Twins arms are folded. Eat hamburgers. Sneeze. First Avenue, rust colored walls. Don't hold the closing doors, ladies and gentlemen. One dollar per wind up kid's toy. One dollar, one dollar. Old sweatshirt, cashmere sweater, yellow smoke stain in the white beard. UFO, yoyo, fresh prints, air conditioned car, nightmare. Please close the windows. Closed eyes, sleeping beauty. Beauty battles grotesque. The only goal is to change the world. Not obtaining beauty.  truth, but materially changing the raw data for new information. This is the information that an entire car of people are alive going somewhere. Third Avenue. Defenders of the Free World. Smile. Smile. Smile. Free Internet access. The means to literacy are what we must obtain, maintain. Want to be in the know? Union Square, Street. Precocious child, complaining mom. Sachs, Fifth Avenue, shaking onto one another. Come on, people. Shine on, you brother. I want something to drink or eat. It's not for drugs. It's for snacks. The crowds don't stop coming.  They don't even know if they're going east or west. Leopard skin jacket casts a flirtatious smile. Family's groceries on the subway bagged in plastic stacked on the floor. Snake skin shoes. F train, fourteenth Street. Black gum spots speckle cracked concrete. Lord have mercy on me, sings the folk rock singer, as the world burns. There's no seats on a Saturday. I just want to go home. Drink juice. The cool breeze pushes through the tunnel. Next train readying. West Fourth. Happy birthday, says a balloon. Broadway Lafayette. Two women talk earning money. The bottom line is everything.  But what about when your whole world falls apart? Someone asks nonchalantly, How are you? Do you answer? My world is crumbling. I'm lonely. The future of death sleeps next to me. The bottom line is not everything. It's just something. A high end journal is not an insult, even if you intended it as one. Mother slaps her hand. Cries more. Blue streaks in black hair. Very rock and roll. She can justify anything under the sun. She's not a bad person. K Pasa. Baby crying. The North Face. The South Caboose. Delancey. We all got our own goals.  The enchanting dark flower, black orchid, heartbroken, by love without feelings, by letters without meaning, by lies and deceit, by desire. The American flag bandana exits at Essex, East Broadway, My Bad, Fat Farm, Hoyt Shimmerhorn, your stuck zipper nerves me. All magazines are TNA rags, edited by ad agencies. Spikely look alike, swoosh hat, doctor J glasses, tolly hot hoochie mamas, riding bootsay, for all your S and M fetishes, party girls out for a night on the town.  A couple holding plastic bags holding each other. Baby asleep in mother's arms. MTA attendant stares down the bongos. Duck taped guitar. Tambourine taped to foot. Bass drum taped to hand truck. Amplifier taped to hand truck. One man band. He's the shit. Slow, heavy, repetitive groove. Train beep, track clack, bongo beat, train rolls in opposite track. Three earrings in your lover's hand on your head. Lemon meringue pie in a paper bag. Looney smile on the woman dressed like a man, or man dressed like a woman. Author of Key Witness. Eyes closed. Hands crossed. What the hell is so funny on your walk?  I count one swoosh on this train. Nike Hegemony, Sweatshop Ladies Head Downtown, Beth Israel Medical Center, Clemente's Animal People, Westin's Vegetables, Poetry Emotion, one eight hundred Divorce, WorldSpy dot com. Our accountant isn't happy. The car smells like filling the blank. Micah says she loves bad smell. I will not accept your passive aggressive tactic to get me to phone you. You crushed me. Thank you for the letter telling me you're writing me a letter that will explain our misshaped emotions. You crush me. We live where you live, all aboard.  Amherst on Bedford. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. I am homeless. I'm not asking for much. Just asking for some food. Careful of the moving platforms. I'm going to see my friend Charles tonight, whose mind just split open like a year ago after his father died, and hopefully this won't happen to Anselm. I think Anselm's stronger than Chuck, so. But whatever, I'm going to read like three poems about after Charles' mind split open, I would go over to New Jersey like once a week and hang out with him. This is what I came back with.  Waterfront obsesso wearing a New Jersey gutter helmet. Stir crazy all about X vecklessly befriending his pals. Love and hatred careening, mine ripping, a prow busting on a rock in a storm. All around death speaks. The fog obscures the glistening boxes, teetering Gotham Babylon babble wise to the stars. The fog makes us noir in the company of men, shooting the blanket motives. No, not smoking, playing hooky for paintings. Check out the possible lips on the six train. Tune out, turn on, take in the cracked, abstract skein, wrecking the plane dealing.  Liberty. Gung ho, can't I come over and crash on the couch? You make a bong and eggs. Devil in the morning, many in a leaky boat. Whack lineage suit crawls along platform edge of path train, drooling night's anesthesia algorithm.
