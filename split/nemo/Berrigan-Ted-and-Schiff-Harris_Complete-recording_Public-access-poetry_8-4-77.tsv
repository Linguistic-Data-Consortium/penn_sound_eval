But the land is overrun by creatures who feel that someone must get the trains to run on time. What day is it? It's moon day. It's land day. It's sun. I don't even know what day it is. And I don't give a flying fuck. My life disintegrates.  and reintegrates. In the process, I lose a tiny bit of my integrity. Every revolution, cells die, regenerate. You and I are the formulation. We are the cosmic in between. No time for self pity, only time for song.  This is the song of the world. The world is death. These guys don't believe that. And neither do I. But the world is death. The many forms of death. Defeated death, resigned death, surprised death, slow death, anguished death, searing death, blinding death, lightning death, delicious death, long awaited death, sleeping death, laughing death.  The world is a puppy dog. The world is a colt falling on its face. The world is a tiny human at birth, eyes closed, crying for food and warmth, reaching out, betrayed in total trust. The world is shit, piss, puke on your face. The world is putrefaction, decay, ecstatic kum, roses, mangoes, magical birds and their songs all in the same place. The world's a pregnant woman afternoon.  I walk down a palm shaded seaside road, the wind whipping white across the hissing sea, taking it easy, taking it easy with my man by my side. How much longer do I got to wait? The world is ants in your sugar and flies in your beer, it's mosquitoes, sunburn and stomach aches, and bulldozers smashing down inaudibly screaming trees to make houses, to make paper, to flash ideas across an imaginary entity spinning through cloudy space. The world's a newspaper, printed in technicolor. You better believe it.  You didn't make it, but love it or leave it, the world's a rip off, a burn. All your dreams come true and nightmares too. It's a pretty good joke and it's on you. So hats off if you don't forget to laugh at yourself even if you got to laugh to keep from crying. It's a pretentious project, a beautiful blunder, a terrible mistake. It's watched over by avenging angels who drink too much and lots of times come to work in a bad mood. It's a police state. Habeas corpus has been suspected.  And the court of appeals has a backlog six centuries too long. But don't worry, because it's your mama giving you a pat on the head and a big kiss. It's sugar. It's the best. It's satisfaction, anticipation, fulfillment, and rest. And I think I'll take a little rest. Okay. Before we continue, I just want to read a poem I wrote. And I think it's very apropos. It's called a good thing where she could steal but she could not rob. Sometimes I'm afraid to rob.  read a poem I've written or to let others read it for fear they'll slap a tag on my forehead, too sweet. It will glow neon and blink her poetry is just like blanks. I wouldn't like that. Or someone had written that poem in their lifetime, so I can in mine. Mark Twain said it best. What a good thing Adam had when he said a good thing, he knew nobody had said it before. Gentlemen, would you like to continue? This is called in four parts. A person can lie around on an uncrowded beach.  And when too much peace and quiet gets on his nerves, he can always get dressed and tour Israel. Mayor Frank X. Graves today ordered the arrest of Alan Ginsburg if the police could prove that the poet smoked marijuana while looking at the Passaic Falls yesterday. The Jewish Memorial Hospital's Junior League will give its second annual disco take benefit Sunday at the Round Table. William Carlos Williams, the Patterson, New Jersey physician, was a strong and vigorous poet who spoke.  in the American idiom. It's true. I'm not finished, Harris, don't get excited. I have to read a very serious work here, but I can't find one. Just a minute. These people wanted to make them laugh. What, these people in a national audience? This is called, it doesn't matter what this is called, this is a series of aphorisms which are geared to inform you. And there's a coda which informs the aphorisms.  The front is hiding the rear. The heart of a man is not as great as an amphitheater. Spinoza is the one who threw a pass to move Spinoza. These are from the French, by the way. There is no death, there is only dissolution. Love of hate is totally great. Me, I disguise myself as a man in order to laugh. I have always loved a serious jackass scene. Infantile paralysis is the beginning of wisdom.  Everything is poison except our meat. Flowers and candy make my teeth ache. The most beautiful and most noble of men are queer. Mystical explanations are dopey. Aunt Winnie fingers the thunder to learn, so that we have left everything aside, but not as a cloud mine steps beside the slow reservoir. Now it is all of this, the pink bulbs included, which means we have protected ourselves by forgetting everything.  All we were dealt. Walking up Second Avenue in the heat, the waves of glamour obscuring the nature of the beings we are, but the cool air makes you say, What the fuck? Give in to the total sensuality that is your big head, your big ass, your big crotch, your spine bouncing around to the rhythm of your walk.
