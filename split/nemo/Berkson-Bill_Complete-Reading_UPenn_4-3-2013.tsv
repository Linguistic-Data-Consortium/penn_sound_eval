Costanza was about twenty four, in Rome, with her talented husband Matteo from Lucca, so he could work with John Lorenzo in Saint Peter's on Matilda's tomb. A fierce and sensual woman in the grip of passion, Wittkauer's idea of what it meant seems more than a little overly presumptuous, looking now at the photograph, striking, instead, as if astonishment, unselfconsciously glancing at, redoubling itself, is what one sees, or else Bernini had just said, Look over there,  Quick, look at me and hold it. Unpocobusto, clothed in a chemise, with ribbon open at the front, her large eyes focused on a distant point, parted face in a tousled crown, coiled braid at the back, stern by nature, steady in his work, passionate in his wrath. Gian Lorenzo kept the image for himself. A year or more, after pausing at dawn, on his way out of town, he saw Costanza in her doorway with his younger brother Luigi, whom he chased down.  broke his leg or a couple of ribs, and rampaging back home, ordered a servant under the pretext of bringing two flasks of wine as gifts to go with a razor, and slash Costanza's face, which isn't shown, and not much else about that morning is recorded. All this, none of that, it matters here, dear illusory remains.  We remember not what's allowed, but simply given antiseptic disputes over pure clove of youth. Exogeny Is when the swimming pool casts its poetry from the side of your mouth. Blue yacht rhythms pop at the flickering bauble on the wrist of personable divinity. You guessed the flavour made the rounds, now actively, now not at all. Whoever lies down by that edge has the fever.  Lady Ayre The meaning of guitar practice slips between pine needles, a bird that thin to the tune of Start me up. Rubrics of screen porch and firefly embolden the effort. All words are prophetic, bare the thread, swallow the cloud, reflected glory drives off, leaving the original in demand. Repeat after me.  This is a little elegy, in a way, for a character that I liked very much in the series The Wire, Omar Little. When Omar Little died, popped in the head by the kid with a handgun in the convenience store, I was depressed for weeks. Still am. Baltimore. The mess people leave. United Gitmo Bower. This is called Dress Trope.  Critics should wear white jackets like lab technicians, curators zookeepers caps, and art historians lead aprons to protect them from impending radiant fact. This poem was written originally as words in a collaborative.  graphic work with George Schneeman in december two thousand eight. And then he went ahead and died in january two thousand nine. And the poem, which when I wrote it, seemed to come really out of some cloud somewhere, turned into a kind of elegy for George. So it's called Last Lines with George. Stars fell. Now the sky feels empty handed. The gods must love you so.  This is Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea, which is a title of a large drawing by Mark Rothko, which now is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but used to be in the museum in San Francisco. Sometime in the nineteen seventies, I think the then director made the huge mistake of trading it away for a complete reason.  inconsequential small Rothgow, and then it turned around and ended up at Moma. You didn't trade it with Moma, it was shocking. So now it has pride of place at the Museum of Modern Art, of course, just about any day you visit. Figures in trees screech, the sun steams, the near air boggles, a voila, the brooding nimbus. Death, real death, it's an old world custom, a certain semblance of knowing what's what, without which nothing works.  This is an attempt at a translation of a in the Russian language, which he is said to have pretty much invented. You know, he's the bedrock of it in the way that Shakespeare is the bedrock of English. Pushkin, this poem, which is known as The Prophet. And it's said that he.  It has a complicated background, but one part of the background is that for whatever reason, I don't remember now, I think he was due in court or up on charges somehow before the Tsar that very day, and wrote this poem for breakfast. Parched with spiritual thirst, I crossed an endless desert sunk in gloom.
