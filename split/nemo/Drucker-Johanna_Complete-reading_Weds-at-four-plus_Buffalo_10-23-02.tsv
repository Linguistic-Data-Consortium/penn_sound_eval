The cat had no idea at all of what to do in traffic, so we put her in her best suit striped, and let her sing to her heart's content. My assistant requires that I show up to these events, and the kids spike their hair, wear beads, and think that they are hip cool, sliding around on gold cushions in front of a hello kitty fantasy scene of after life, in a perpetual neon glow. No seams, no cracks, flat surfaces, very hot color. That's what dreams are made of.  Sterner stuff. The brutalized compound, cruelty in the air, bitter life on the wing. The news knows no bounds. We are subject to reports. The book watches me read again and again, and tells everyone what I think about it. Nothing much. The grain was matted with blood, houses everywhere, crushed rock clogged their mouths, gaping open, lips like mashed potatoes, blood red sunset, again streaked with success. The campaign was almost over. Who would ever watch this again? four. Extropian Measures.  Excitement, heroic as dawn, shot through with early explosions, bargain hunted into swollen categories of solid waste, our products recycled on flatbed trucks brought in from the coast. These moral pleasures exceed the tax code. Mad and gentle, private as passion, the ten ton delivery rubble brushed to the surface, high madness, asphalt and asphalt and old Macadam, broken remnants of a lost tribe, skills embedded in the chunked material, cult knowledge now on sale, insipid commerce.  Fertile heat, challenging thought threatens to transform all challenges into an assault upon torpid flesh, pearls, jewels, dime store, stones, all upscale chains, spread with the usual precious metals, band of platinum, silver thread, the whole front window case of display items behind her head in an advertisement of the last weeks of summer. Gone. Magpies took their pick, plucking eyes from the rockets and leaving them blind on their course. Nell is now smiling, with all supposed attitude, while the bearing C, furious at inattention, coincidentally, not causally, abruptly changed. Okay, some light.  passed through here, one afternoon forty years ago. I came back today to track it. Light trackers, partial thoughts, whole memories, images pale as cotton after bleach. Young and thin, in a machine made dress that could not adapt itself to her limbs, equally awkward, the stiff, cheap, white cloth and the pale, knock kneed legs limited in their range of movement by her inexperience of herself in the world. Fresh as a fucking flower, she stood there, her one hundred eighty dollars shirt thin and delicate as those emulsions filmed she fetishizes floats off their paper back, with tiny tweeds.  I make delicate compositions, pedal by small pedal, since when I was a child. I love nature, natural forms. I used to collect the cuttings that fell from my father's hand. My father, he was a botanist, a professor, and a gardener. And all this time her bare legs, thin and mottled, balanced precariously, even thin as she was, on the near invisible but very, very pointed, anxiously high heeled sandals, her long blood hair curled, who does that now? to lie on her shoulders, shining like her eyes. And thank you to all the women who supported this exhibition, the brave women, their courageous act of underwriting. Robot voice, robot voice, something is calling me, calling me.  forms auto poetic, self defining, complex and ubiquitous. The candy machine over there knows me. It does. I feel so appreciated. She went all over the world, weeping histrionically, tears on my pillow far from home, her lean militant form arched against the bleached stones of the pilgrimage site in Tunisia, while her head drooped with the weight of unrequited martyrdom. Her tall limbs, charged with faith, strode along the road to Canterbury, leading the group of otherwise jovial companions, on the road in Rome and Rouen, Chartres and Amiens, on the path to remoter sites along the Black Sea and into the sacred places.  of the Eastern Church. At eighteen, she was pale, fierce, erect, prouder at twenty two, at thirty, an iron maiden, resolute and commanding, at thirty seven, an intimidating force, at sixty, severe and twisted. They snuck away from her one morning, tired of her haranguing speech and her love of God endlessly ruining their meal time chatter. Who wrote this? Well, the son wrote at first in cipher, but it was illegible and ungrammatical. So two levels of code are necessary to break. Who recovered this? The priest friend to women, who was a stylish fellow, quick to see the conversational.  Literary value of the tale. Edit on the run and make the image sequence thick as raw matter, pulled from city streets and publications, tepid malls and pulsing freeways, pop life culture, always toiling, and the humans? Well, she lived in daily expectation of canonization, and that's a lot of posture to uphold. Infidels, we captured moments and held them in our cheeks, storing the sensation, Oh, you can take anything to market here. Forms of realism, however, remain dull as gift shop sentiment, filling the space with older folks, each happier than the next to imagine owning a piece of their lives in such tamed and framed briflings.  Existential heat in a cold location, fracturing my Sunday along a line of pause.
