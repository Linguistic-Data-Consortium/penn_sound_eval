I entire toured and am placard. I am not placard. Show me coming back to me. Show me no placard coming back to me. Placard me, but with only you. So I mean, couldn't me placard be a good one? Be a placard. Be a placard. That secret placard beside a nice tree. Be like that orgone thing. Nodules are cats. Keepie me, keepie, keepie. Meow, placard, meow, or cuss at me. Placard Tony, placard toy. Topaz and show me me.  Placard to be placed inside meat free zone and well, it could be a back country communist acupressure world mind genre, all that beeping stuff in a speaking box. The narrative quiescence of the abstract scene in the book jacket photo doesn't have a setting so much as a latent impenetrability, not unlike the lenient, bitter bracketed.  Lattice work of emotion I'm culled to reencode for no reason lost, or lone and lost, or left over and lost, or lacking loss, based in a brick sickness of stilted words, the scene leans in fortunate, unmasked, taking its saturate incongruence to the hilt. Witness the solemnity as an excuse for however central such simple shapes sound in a show of colored lights under the eaves, and notice how subtle the supple learn the other's graffitoed violence, or a shapeless mass, or a low.  Loaf of tawdry shinola, or a list of fictions like days like stars burning like ideologically judgmental harmonies out of their trance awake. Patience plus thematically lactate spirits in neutral space yearn into the dreary cone it passed pale to taunt that step, that blatant sleep, that singular individual instance of one it. Weird. Yet monochromatic war was no longer satire, so much as some technophobe totem experimenting over it.  over the balcony in the gas he goes to call and is stirred by, but managed somehow to boast anyway something about a drinking problem or a missing arm or an alien culture. But I stopped it there feeling the terms alien and culture extremely personal and felt the danger, the literal urge in fact to actually say something about micromanaged alienation and the experience of audience participation as portrayed in the soft porn novels of my own two tiered society. Nevertheless, this urge passed and was lost, was gone, was jettisoned, was judiciously diluted.  disearned and left out the lays of the intervenient chaos locked in on the smiling clenched dust revealed to me in that light thus spoke, or the sound of a footstep which unfolds which for it to be what it is for itself I give up and look up. This is why the sick child falters in a field of abstraction. This is why the stalactites must be left in place for the next clumsy oath. You are not here. Heads or tails  With ink in it, open and or closed in the amused, swerving, almost always unable to find the underlined passage. What time did I start? I have a toad. Its name is Boober. Boober the toad. Boober raises rabbits.  We live in a big can named Big Can. Mostly they complain. Boober bangs the lid for them to calm down. It doesn't work. At the last annual convening of the International Monetary Fund, Boober spoke to a packed house about toad stuff. He talked it up good and the bankers banged their lids. Sometimes Boober and me smoke pot. Other times, usually while banging, Boober has a twitch of sympathy.  But always for himself, and he calls the phone and it says anything, so he bangs on it too. And I feel sorry for it and hang around with all these other things in the room wondering about this banging toad in my life. Boober gets a by gosh, by golly expression, which on a toad looks like all their other expressions. But that toad'll sing, little girl, I don't work in no candy kitchen. Nah, and I don't sell no chewing gum. Do any of you folks have toads? Can you help me through my toad difficulties? Sometimes I lie asleep all night.  I just can't take it anywhere anymore. Sometimes I think I should get a frog instead, but my friend Jiggs Casey has a frog, and he built a nuclear weapon with it, and I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't call me anymore. You can actually see Boober on the web. Bill LaWoma did this just terrific postcard collage of Boober, and it's on Laura Moriarty's magazine site called Non. I think you can get it on the EPC. Definitely check it out.
