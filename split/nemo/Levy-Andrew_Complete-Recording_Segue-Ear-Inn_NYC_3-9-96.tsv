The outline of the lifted finger, his most recent critics, are tender. No one will purchase it. A pure land. When the stars begin to fall, doubts and confidences spill out. Who will hear the shout of victory? Pattern design. A private person inside lateral speech. Immediate left. Take me with you. Who are you? Etymology knowing neither place nor form over someone else's.  Tenderness and patiently now stand in peril. Ideas, lessons, thinks about an unteachable gift of nature. Farmer prophesies better than poet. Seacoast, seder forest. The heartlessness. Unfailing, they will not speak to anyone else. Absolutely concrete, secondary. What other elements does his training include? Went to the field to catch them. Happy birthday from nature. Body of infancy, his bad attitude will not be pardoned. Every care is great loss. This is my mouth stood open, this place.  under the screen, a rope from hell to hang her. Abandon sovereignty. Close my mouth. I am a prisoner. There is a shortage of things for me to read. The world is like night. Continuous, discontinuous, to Laney. The world are the end of the world. I had returned unexpectedly from the dead. In Trustville, you become a truly blessed man, or woman, and woman? Don't make any major life decisions while you're on the verge of giving a poetry reading.  A little writer for Andy. The woman with stern has a tongue that foams. The earth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere. The little dancers decline any pretense of rigor. The words dead tired, born in this gap, see without eyes a man without ears, arm bent behind his back. Pronounce it as real, the empty place where each can move freely, here, on the earth. The idea of no existence outside of this incommensurability, and nothing's posse. Make believe it came from you. Keep all your money in a big brown bag, baby, ceaselessly, reduces the ability of the earth.  This is not your wish. Dear Helene Sisoo. This is the sleeping ear laid down, an ear of the earth. Armpits do. They make money the old fashioned way. They earn it. The smell of your kidney in the air. After. Didn't want corresponding choice lies. Anything about him. I was rereading this yesterday and the other night I turned on the TV at midnight and I caught the tailing of Steve Forbes advertisement for the flat tax.  And it ended. I just caught the end of it. It said, Steve Forbes. It had a picture of him. It said, Steve Forbes, Conservative for President. And within a split second, all of a sudden, the screen was filled with four words. Really bad soap scum. And the segue was like, it was incredible. I felt like I felt like Hannah Wiener was communicating with me and had a kind of clairvoyant moment. It's like TV, you know, can be great sometimes. Melt after Stein. You can see the movement of them to be obvious. Somehow one simple, innocent doesn't move.  that no longer exists. The speaker, writer, is probably between things and words. A chocolate bar from a dispenser. It's about distance. A triangle in the distance, a jet plane overhead. I wonder what it says. An amalgam of things the word has taken you in its craft. Sometimes listen to him who are certain. Too much rain made of trees, a single tax. The idea of the story is very often the same. Something to complete our capacity for escape, in particular to wend names spoken together capable of moving, the role of silence is to restore objects.  So much useless suffering. All there is of a fist is a question to adopt. A whole soldier, any whole soldier, does not mean paper. And making a choice, taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them. So comforting that you are compelled to bring to a righted place after the disturbance of a phone call or disjuncture. What's worth what? The measure of force enters the form of the whole thing. Slashed nostril, paper black. The nervous system, from North Dakota to an eternal conclusion.  It makes a difference if I send this page through the dominant coalition of interests. Look at that apple colored luggage. Look at that tawny port. Purple clouds to Bruce. From purpled foreheads, speechless, over the broken human bodies, the night is bending, decomposed, fled. Make mistakes in psychic income, justice, encoded antinomy. This isn't about inheritance of world self. You find problematic a capitalism of aesthetic agency.  Rampant in the formalism, too much logic is lemon, postmodernism versus the color pink. Out of the purple speech filled night, bodies bending beneath income, problematic as pink lemonade is sweet, stolen car parts decomposed, the formal logic broken. I am the voice, I am the pronunciation of my name. Whoever hears these pronouns, unemployed persons, the slow work and its occasional light lives of another shelter from snow.  wind. A vertical light without shadow, like those everyone had known. Points of landing which were never filled. It says, This essay was once a liquid, light rain in Central Park. A little man made of stinky cheese, golden eared, coiled, resembling a gnat. These senses twist upon or around themselves. They are shaped like an old fashioned sandal. They digress, delay, deviate from the normal. Do they? A varietal identity, epiphetic, not parasitic. A simple melody, a symphony, mothering. How would they know these? Come back to it.  head raised in a gesture of greeting, someone had quietly told him.
