Coolidge-Clark_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_11-14-90	0.0	369.05	 Come from the middle and go home. Performing woman in a calabash, Haste to display, and all plumb. Passing along the way Of seamless parlors, pastures, plates in flight, Today becomes the day His goldfish thinking stands, among which Dial the last of the food, fuel o'er its night, Which, thanks for the money, in the park, the rose stood till land, Found the count of the world in its caves, a guava would. Bombings? Two moments, just. The second takes a safe lock, Street of red silk.  The term of the world is right away. Remember that firehouse angle closed against my chimes? Drilled. And a bleak light on the matter is the matter. Double. To morrow the raisins will be making their turns. I am merely to maintain the lead here. A hopeless handle for all takers. How to find where the scent comes loose? Birds hop over anyone's brain, perhaps taking. Glass, that's how that arrow does its leveling. I have to make five or six, or there might be too much food a day, and smiled at the stolen steaks. Hear me, lady, be a taste of it yourself, and then lend hold of the tool, a fact of second duck.  Too much height hard to handle, Decibel. Then the home street fled open, walked himself loose from her gown, over, that's the way of the sample, turpentine, but no takers down are known, my fingers spine. The world of food gets traded for all the rest of the worlds, arrows to be looked and locked if the ducks have their say. You are, after all, with many open lines, a battle for the handles of many takers. Then there's a second light on thicker desserts, behind which the jury rehearsed, I may say, safe and sharp, rods at dawn at the top of a trunkful of birds.  Red people in those mountains, a sharp firing of light on the obliquer deserts. I opened that street with my sharp picture. Why not? It's a carved world. Blessing. Ringlock told Wake, those ducks were someone's brain. The trees, once out front, are in your bedroom. Lug the vacuum. It don't quite matter, that ruby of a world's scissors. Sort of how it did that to hide? Aeroplanes in trouble turned off at his desert. A wasted pocket tap touched again today. A three inch plane with six aboard. Extremely difficult for the thicker drugs.  Sickle for eleven, no better than a piercing buzz. That key emits the squatter music. Four old hands ready to roll. The day, the room is a sugar splay. The chairman of tormidons, his wings, just like the news. Every scrape that monk loves, outside of his clothes, his overlap and dew mist, slice. How could we be? Carbar, in my sense of it, is laugh to the slaughter, holistic peals, drills, the sliding cracks that came away loose in my fire bend, the handle of my pocket. The other meant surgery. Pictures requiring radio of a teacher in a bus whose bird gone over the top, whose latch.  Do you continue to serve the hot light? Waste in making its turns, salads, tamps. My fingers on the world's spines at last ticket the ruby troubles en masse. Always it is reddish at the tops of the sharper mountains. I have no trouble. A handle on that tree came away like news. It was impenetrable to maintain. It was last to be, or watch four hours of electric fish. Suppose it made safe the caves all locked away, bite. A vacuum is wasted aboard. I wanted to get the scissors fired up here.  turn, thick ruby on the fire escape. I'm not surprised at the wheat in the sky. It's part, this knock, from her gown, the handle taken down. The say which we have had, touch? Ya, down with all their ways. I am merely perhaps to find the same looked, locked lines, flea cap, modest pate, light on making their turns. What in the world if the ducks had fingers? Mountains in the street. Right, the matter of airplane flare, surgery cracked and was gone, ducks in ruby trouble. Here my tool, four old squats, good morning. Behind which dawn at the top of those mountains a street,  blessing the raisins there with turpentine. The duck had not set foot on their property. Lugs, tolls, loose in the pictures of any beaches, a pumpable horn. Double term at the same mill, then the news of any sugar in my fire. Other ways to say, which top's so sharp? As if we're there, those birds, I mean. Trouble, after all, takes takers. The matter with airplanes that they won't hide. Mountains rose at that old firehouse, lady all ears at the angel's stakes, maternal room for the difficult buzzing, for the lending I came out of log rolling, hiding, why not a wasted wing?  And roll and rushing around, table map dangling. I opened those mountains, world. A mighty sharp ring means too much food, yourself and the fact of home. Perhaps I have smiled. The truckers rehearsed at the firing of the light. Audre took a taste of duck, smiled and walked himself loose. I may say of birds, they won't. The day of a woman's way of food. Whew, lucky kneaders dialing in a blend of shoe makes witness of us all, even in this sort of vacuum. Nice of you to knock. Smelled a presence. Out front, it didn't quite matter.  things aboard, hands on their wings. Let's go out behind the beach and love in pockets. A sample result of birds with too much food. Vacuum failure.
