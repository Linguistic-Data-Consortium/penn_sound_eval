But the woman had pulled him so strongly into her front that a button of her dress had dug into his cheek above the bone, and that pain took over. But after that, but after that, he saw the hand often looking where it was cut through, just like the meat in the butcher's. There was something he wanted to do with it. He picked it up and felt it from outside and then from in, as though he wore it on his wrist like his own hand.  He still searched for the jagged metals, but now his father had told him where it came from. He treasured particularly those pieces, molded like a screw. He saved them up, hoping he'd one day have all the pieces, and be able to put them together, like a jigsaw puzzle, and build a shell of his own. Would it be mine? he asked the father, or the government's? His father told him, his, if he kept it hidden. So there was that to think about. He could go out looking in the gutters when the sounds came, late at night.  I'm going to start with a book with a poem from my first book which came out in nineteen sixty five called The Gathering. That's the name of the book. The poem is called We Could Get a Drink. Sunday morning lying in complacency of the newlywed.  Out the windows of slender sun silver trees lead me back to Hampstead Heath, where I run again down sparse grass banks by clumps of gorse below silver trees, I try to tell you, but end up. We could get a drink on a Sunday anyway. You laugh, move closer under the covers. Our silver limbs stir in the gloom like cutthroat trout.  I saw in a lake a hundred miles out of Vancouver, hiding their striking shadow. The mind of fish shifting fragilely its position when the body's easy, a still pool. Now it is in a scene from a documentary seen months back. Girl, eyes like yours. Girl, slung over a Tommy's shoulder, mouth open, but nothing said until.  The commentator, as the camera pans, pass the black patch. I don't watch because my eye hooks on the hat rack hips. Says, starved to death. The soldier throws her into a pit. That's a tangle of white, very slender limbs. Went sliding down the crater's muddy side. The instant I called, there's a bomb. Fell here last night. Let's look at the crater. Went running over.  Laughing, my friends along, running down to today, when looking at Silver Birch, I say nothing at all, but we could get a drink there, move closer beneath the blankets, while the cutthroats flick under their bank.  This next poem was issued as a book called Please Like Me. It was put out by Blacksborough Press in Los Angeles this year. Strolling through the town, all the houses quiet at this hour of the street, already hot old women. The leader of our magazine crew knew how to gain entrance by knowing that door opening before the act, the door opening.  The woman with him, his packet, already hung on the back of a chair, his shirt coming off, crossed to the window to pull the shade, making it might. But in the morning, unknowing, despite the looks she gave him, and me watching, mentioned her husband, who handled such matters, her hands, at the necklace her throat was naked on. Compliant women, my expression, insisted equally, turned me away, and they would. A snapshot one of them took, as I locked up my arm to me.  Dark faded falls from my wallet as I count my tape from last night. Another subscription sold, working late to think. Great weight brought to bear on a door flies open at your first touch. Your momentum pitches you sickeningly into the vacuum cleaner. Parked in a narrow hall, the muscles involved with nothing to parry ache. A nagging sense of something far from being right. A wrench in the very socket of the self, a disarming tenderness as if on the instant I stopped now.  Knocked here, went in, found Roseland slid indistinctly for the sun that floods the room. The brakes, the skid begun, surface slick with the summer shower, he jammed the chevis, ties, nothing to grip on, slid the four of us within inches of the poem's abruption. Welcome. And again, welcome. Make yourself to home. Threw nails into the plaster that wouldn't support even a picture.  Hardly a heavy piece, skewer, skewer, print, cut with a knife from a library book, because I, against all claims of social conscience, against all readers whose thighs tomorrow would push against the metal cross piece of the turnstile, wanted it. The blood floods the shaft, half moon. Focus in an enormity of sky extends by fractions limits. The blood continuously feeds skin, sinew, ligaments, wherein a heaviness.  Pause it. Nights and it is nights. A white flashlight conjures a white door. A red calls forth a red with which you can't come in, she shouts. But that's no use. I want. All right, you son of a bitch, you bluffer, even though the sentiment itself be but a bluff, I'll call you. But useless again if the man on the path must tell her what to say.  She switches on her porch light and the day goes, that kind of light by which the face that passed, translucent skin, nose freckled at what bridge it had, the eyes prominent enough so light could be seen to pass through the pupil, nonetheless left dark, but liquid dark, the bones of the cheek and chin so clean.
