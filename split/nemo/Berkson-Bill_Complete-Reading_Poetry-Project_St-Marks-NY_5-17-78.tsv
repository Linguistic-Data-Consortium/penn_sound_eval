Us looking up to Saint Bridget. Let's see now, where are we? It is dust in New York, about to be Christmas and next nineteen sixty one. We are not detectives, are we? So we don't care what time it is. Where will we all be on New Year's Day? Saint Bridget knows, but she has.  He hasn't sent out invitations yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, as the Japanese are always those heathens saying. And yet we know, we really know, don't we, where we'll be? We'll be at Clavins or Glennans or McGiverns or McGoverns or McGillivrays, dead drunk for Saint Bridget and for Doom. Doom, dum, didoom. I am really thinking of Cassez Sa Peep by Norman Bloom, and I think it is a good idea, Death, which will begin again an unbearable musique concrete. It is impossible to be American if you're not French first. It is impossible to fuck without thinking of oeuf sur le plat or of B.  Being welcomed to Paris at night after a long, boring train ride. For women are like that. They make you feel you have traveled a long way and might as well take what comes and come to what will take you. But not Saint Bridget. She comes first no matter how fast you are and lingers last not just for breakfast but for the whole fucking weekend and lasts and lasts. That's how American women are. And you can't be French first unless you move pretty fast and Saint Bridget may not protect you but she does keep you alive if that's your idea of a good time. But stick it out if you can.  But what about Saint Bridget? Doesn't she have a history? I know she doesn't have a record. How long does a yawn last, or a world, or a gunfight? That's what I mean. It's inconsequential. How many thoughts you have? It's the violence that counts. I think everything began on august thirtieth, nineteen thirty nine. I don't think anything is interesting before that, except that I discovered it later. I don't care when Saint Bridget was born, or David, or Michelangelo, or Diagolef, or William Carlos Williams. They started with me because I thought about them first. I built the Church of Saint Bridget and feel responsible.  I am everybody's victim except Joan Mitchell's. Not only that, you are a very sad person too, isn't he, Saint Brigid? If only I had more MD, I wouldn't be such an evil person going around admiring crooked steeples and ineffectual saints, and just to show how totally like the neighborhood I am, I'll confess that when I run out of milk, I drink it black. How's that? How's that for commitment? That's MD, Mater Dolorosa.  Now I have to read all by myself again. No, I don't. Actually, this is a poem that is another collaboration.  One I still find really very interesting, written with Larry Fagin and Ron Paget. It's called Variations on a Theme of William Carlos Williams. And the way this poem was written was Larry and Ron and I were sitting at Ron's house one afternoon, and we, for one reason or another in the conversation, recalled a poem of William Carlos Williams, which you're going to hear in three versions. We tried to recall how the poem went or how it was written. And so each of us wrote out our own sense of how the poem went.  went how the lines broke and what the words in the William Carlos Williams poem were. And this is what we got, one, two, three. One, I have eaten the plums in the ice box which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were delicious, so cold and so sweet. Two, I have eaten the plums that were in the ice box and which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were so delicious.  So sweet and cold. three. I'm sorry I ate the plums you had in the ice box and which you had intended for breakfast. They were really good, cold and sweet. And Ron already read the next poem.  Election Day fog. The perfect roundness, halo, and density of headlights coming from behind as I walk uphill, heading towards a house where warmth may freely spread its muted grace notes like pork chops cooking. It's been a short day, just the right number of decisions too. Everything else has everything else, says the light of another strike. It looks like that one is going up in smoke. Meanwhile, the past is calling.  It all comes back more or less amusing, like the anatomy of melancholy, a studied look into the not too distant winning flame. Is there a pitcher of water around or do you have an extra beer there, Ted?  Belgian reflexes for Philip Gustin. It takes no will to enter the world, but there are few exits. A place where sentiment is everywhere, a merciless buffet.
