Howe-Susan_04_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_11-6-94	0.0	355.04	 Cries of love and alarm on the soundtrack fade into an air raid siren, factory whistle, or is it the whistle of a train approaching? We are as real and near as cinema. A little girl half turned away, holding her doll, smiles shyly. When the ambiguous siren or engine wails its warning, she turns directly towards the camera. Medium close up, her expression changing to a mixture of astonishment or terror. This child isn't acting. Perhaps she knows what the young actor in Ivan's childhood pretends he knows. Her look pierces the mask of Western.  Almost forty years later, in june nineteen seventy two, a terrified Fan Thi Kin napalmed in era by a South Vietnamese bomber will come running naked down a road, having torn off her burning clothing. She is running towards the camera's single eye. A man without wings swings slantingly into view through free space, mute sky. One, two, three, four, five, six seconds of silent soundtrack before liturgical music through fading to a certain point, then tapering.  Getting wave notes risen from years of other powers. Balancing and hovering, he is swinging in a basket, as if reentrance is easy. Swings in again, coming home, so it's a picture projected through time, subtler than poems or a letter, because he is working on it. Found footage shown at slower speed, here is power. A tremendous stratosphere spinnaker, so weightless after the weighty Spanish evacuation sequence, hovers, preparing for liftoff well he needs no map to return, if fiction, angel, astronaut, returns.  to home base, as if he merely floated out of sight for fun, as if reentrance is possible, and surely there are to be anchorage mooring, helpers waiting. Starboat USSR resembles a light sail of great speed, used on yachts when running before the wind, spinnaker, because a yacht called Sphinx carried such a sail in eighteen sixty six. Utilitarian loveliness, a huge bubble of nylon pulling tons of boat through water, but sometimes relentless swinging and thrashing shakes the rig out of her tug in.  Drawing now the long chase ahead. Coming next will be other newsreel footage of young soldiers slogging through mud and shallow water, not doing well exhausted, though one or two smile wanly at the camera. I wish you could see this film. Sometimes I recognize you inside it, so scared and young, always among those Soviet soldiers who were crossing Lake Sivash. Why should there be twice as many sick as wounded? You float back to me everything inexpressible. Aerodynamic repair experiment for the freshly washed white stone.  USSR, getting ashore to let you sleep well. Light sail of great spread used on yachts when running before the wind. Once you could cover my hand completely with your palm. A huge bubble of nylon pulling tons of water through sky water, swinging and thrashing, relentless threatening to shake the rig out, now tugging water, now touched by science, now drawing silence inside the long chase ahead. Scenes like this, men use. Clinging vine method to hang on, filling out, running before the wind.  But here there is no yacht, and open ocean is air. The effect is the same, flying jibout astride the small boom so spinnaker to get north. Smaller balloons circle and touch the mother one, as satellites do. Then sacred chorus, singing sanctus, sanctus, all is well, melody for a while. Melodies antedate languages, they do not grow old. A peaceful, weightless, wingless furlough, one or two other balloons revolve around these smaller powers after peace. One aerialist soldier, attached by a string to a satellite balloon, floats.  Floats in and down across the screen from right to left, where are his supports as child attached to a mother? As if he were returning home again, a crowd to watch and applaud, so from heaven he smiles. Where are you, systems of planets around us, drifting out of sight, away out of the frame of the screen behind the wings? Annihilation is the deep chaos answer, sheets and white film turmoil. It's a separation wish to be carried out also as if to silence of ether. Irrationality of speech to surrender the beauty of ether.  This voyage without baggage to shed earth because our fathers have not kept their word. Artivisers and builders convey to one another someone was thought to be worthy. Colorless prefigures a connection when the unconscious mind mirrors love partners who are in absolute contrast but by early influence that the child had had time, if ever there was a way, to translate the feeling of image juxtaposition in these words moving from left to right across this sheet of paper.
