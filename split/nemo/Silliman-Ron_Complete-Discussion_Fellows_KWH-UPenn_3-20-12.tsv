A quality of light underneath the street lamp is how it dampens color, how color itself is a thing imposed as the sun imposes day. Day when it arrives, if it arrives, is layered and must be stripped, though never in the same way twice, if ever we are to discover the pulse at the core. What fiction, what nonsense.  Voices over in the corner, jabbering, with no thought of who listens. The line already is inherent in the upright letter oriented. Speech is not a given. The tongue is infected. It is very cold. Worlds hurtle through the night sky, where it is apparent that day is the exception, that it may even be a fiction, a creation not of light, but of desire. I want speech. Sky, air, wind, sun surround. For want of storm windows, we hung quilts. Birds shake snow from the lighter branches.  One doesn't so much sleep under all these blankets as one does cook. Pencil is a blunt instrument. In a coma, I am told, all evidence of palsy disappears. You yawn freely, widely, the way an infant yawns asleep. I shall not hear birds in these trees again. Words hurtle through the night sky. three. Stripped of furnishings, the familiar house became exactly what it was. An object, alien, a machine, each room a potential or function. There, in the leafless forest, we could see the huge nest high atop a poplar.  Here I can walk to the train, so much assumed in the instant. twenty five bones per hand or foot, three muscles roughly for every bone. Behind that wall, the low hum of the surface. After several days of warmer temperatures, the snow still has not melted, the last mounds dark and translucent, cakes of ice. Odd how, after thirty years, a phrase such as The Beauty, Wapiti, still rings in the mind. Oncoming cars, headlights shimmer dimly in the fog. At the road's edge, back in the streets, the deer watch us.  Without interpretation, the flower's knowledge of its own process is not counted as mine. I walk with each hand bald into a fist. Four. Oh yeah, you're one of the ones who can write in the dark. Thank you, Ron. So we have some time for questions. Molly's got the microphone. Who is going to be brave and ask the first question? And here we go, right in the back there, Molly.  Good morning. So I wanted to talk about the blog a little bit more before it gets too far away from that. And I was really curious, I mean, you talked a little bit about how it's a way to educate people without the filter of the university. Grotesque. Grotesque filter. You like that word. You said it. And I remember a couple of years ago when you disabled comments on your blog. And the reasoning you gave was trolling and flaming. And I know the Buffalo Poetics List serve kind of had the same thing a few years ago. And I mean, the first thing I thought of was a sort of generation.  because I think for the young people in here, we see YouTube comments or these kinds of things that, you know, you know what to ignore and you know what to listen to. So I was curious if you think there is any sort of general generational divide in language we accept, if there's a valuation of language in the discussion that kind of goes on on the internet. Well, actually, it's more a gender than a generational one, at least with regards to the blog. But I'll try and deal with both of these. As my job during the last twelve years ramped up in the amount of time it absorbed.  ability to police the comment section on a daily basis was beginning to extend further and further. There were a number of people, are a number of people, not just on my blog, but elsewhere on the net, who do seem to be completely unaware of the implications of some of their language when they use terms of color and gender, when, you know, there's the joke of the old Saturday night live routine, Jane, you ignorant slut, when somebody hears themselves called out on the weblog by somebody whose name they know it's actually less pleasant.  And not catching every one of those every day meant that I was having a reaction that was, I think, dividing my readership by gender so that my blog was becoming more and more of a male space. And with all the negative aspects of the male space.
