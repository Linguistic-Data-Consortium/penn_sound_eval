Kinsella-John_02_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_11-6-96	0.0	394.06	 Fourth disclaimer. From the gaming table to the early opener, the risk of needle stick not obvious with the first mescal, though sex traps skirt the dance floor and I its centre, a lavender swirl opaque with dry ice, a paradox of people cloistered in the wild, the state of nature realigning, the recognition in a drama of substances, the solitary actor holding the cup high, projecting his voice at the light etched ceiling, calling for more, the recognition inadequate, a ploy, a foil.  This is a poem called Echidna. Echidna is a porcupine like animal found in Australia. It's a marsupial monotreme. It produces eggs and suckles its young in the pouch. So it's a strange combination of creatures that has a duck. I mean, it has a kind of pointed nose that's quite bony and strange. The closest animal to it is in fact Platypus, which has a duck like bill and is also a monotreme.  There it are, for reasons which will be obvious. Rhythmically burrowing up on the top road in the graded remainders, the swampy contours that look good for digging that you'd like to get amongst and smell, those substratas more than dirt and roots, rhizomic agendas of the feeble eyed, uttering up refrains from where compactness and density are demarcation and territory, where decaying melly root or corpse of storm felled wandoo tan the leathery bag of muscled fluid, the flow of ants as white as Moby Dick, as determined against storms.  the pulpy hull of trees as against the gridded surface. Down here, where the highway is sensed in the movement of sand particles, the erosion is tri cha, determinedly sits. In English, hedgehog excavates. At risk, this bristling heart litters the road with dedication, symbols of the national psyche left to bloat in the sun's blistering, blistering prosody, inseparation that mimes mechanics on the surface by heart, that without footnotes is still recognised as the source of oxygen.  I consider as memory tracking an Echidna with a farmer in jam tree country, locating the spirit of place, as if its being curled in a tree hollow might validate the vast spread of open tillage. But struck by a kind of amnesia, we wandered in a circle tight as a fist, exhuming the deeply choric question of rendering our meanderings into prose, into idle chatter to accompany a few beers in the pub that night, the portfolio of our imagined data presented with detachment as the slow movement.  underminer of our confident lyrical selves, fed ravenously deep in the heart of the forest. I'd like to read something very different now from The Undertow. It's from a long poem written a number of years ago called Syzygy, which created something of a controversy in Australia when it came out. two. Fallout A refugee from contentional loadstools into the projector taking the negative impression of junking expression, prizing anger out of its balls to damage flooding retentive spool experiment, releasing heat.  Remember losing these impressions. Machinery expressive in light conscious love, scarifying poisons, detracted rocketing, the clouds of loamy earth, bootlegging frustration, mudbrick and fence wire, circular saws threatening Robert Frost and doorposts jamming two years too old, and rotting, the sun, orange plastic. Perfect. The film was black and white, and the sheep gurgling hysterically. three. Self regarding homunculous metal chambers, tinfoiling exclusions like humidicribs wheeling slick asphalt deletions and stripping film. Dust water licking axminster carpet spreadsheets, what shows in the headlight or pinhead a spotlight crunch. Synthetic victims. And the frogs croak politely in their ditches. Halt. Goodyear wet weather halts the death of a spotlight.  As everyone just outside the butcher's shop can't read the signs. Good. Who gives a damn anyway? Needed. Inquire within. Good management and sensible market indicators. Those who leave anything up to description need not remote opinions. Morality stinks. We keep it in buckets. four. When the flappers tickle your fancy. Opposing needs, priming Pollegra with plastic cement like jelly rubber, singing aging movies, tall tails, lagging grabness out of forums, humotrophic water glass or sundial gas bagging in the shader, such as fame, passing the time. The car comes, a stretch in tails. Silk doors, Prudella, a junk tin driver, and talent let us in, taking us entire rhomboidal, all an ooh la la. So serious through disconnection, baffling siblings.  Oh my flappers, what a team we make. And the planets cohabitate and read life impression, you have your strict in your lacks, the cups drink too much, and the television in the back of the limo is stuck on the same channel. The driver is sucking himself. Take no notice. You are my family, he splurges, executors, guardians, trustees, receivers, inheritors, goodsides, halfbacks, contrivas, emissaries, agitators, incarnations, lovers leaping into the tide pile of my flesh. five. The Cane Cutter Reflex, take a breath. A snake operates amongst rough cane cutters, crystalline sweat, a particle overload. Heavy rain bearing down, palpitating trifolite with sun and cane, no rainbow makes an appearance. Earthy, very earthy.  My asthma camouflaged mud takers, all takers, and throws back a marsh of fences. They beg for tariffs. They like restrictions. In the highlands, water is lightning, gaping press down and half bass relief. Turbine chernake comes down when the high life where the era is heavy. No fireflies there. Downstand riddle deep, deep south, roots dry, bone black, subterranean streams, rattled shapes, forking esuarine or making archaeological lights. Spence warming the traps for this is ground zero, warholing in cyclone territory, zoning the sirens, equivocating hot dogs and pies, mushrooms pushed to the side of the plate, Cadillacs racketing Monroe hubcaps, currency cut like love on a breezy day.
