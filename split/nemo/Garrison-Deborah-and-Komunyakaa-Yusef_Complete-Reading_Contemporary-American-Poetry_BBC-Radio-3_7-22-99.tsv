In the black mirror, a woman's trying to erase names. No, she's brushing a boy's hair. I should say that it took me fourteen years to write about the Vietnam experience, and at the time I was renovating a house in New Orleans, and that pretty much prompted a moment to write about Vietnam. I had very systematically written around that experience.  Well, here's a poem that's a bit more personal. It's about something I've actually had quite a bit of trouble writing about, which was the death of my father, who passed away when I was fourteen. And as anyone knows who has lost a parent and certainly lost a parent at a bit of a younger age, there is this in a way, of course, it's an incredible tragedy, but there are other things that come with it. And I guess as I grew older, I felt a strange sense of almost specialness for having survived this thing in my teenage years. And I often have reflected on it as I've grown older that one feels the sadness and the guilt, but on another's side of the coin is the sense of having been singled out and having been made special by having to go through this experience.  And I tried to capture that, I don't know if I have, but this poem is called She Thinks of Him on her birthday. It's still winter, and still I don't know you anymore, and you don't know me. But this morning I stand in the kitchen with the illusion, peeling a clementine. Each piece snaps like the nickname for a girl, the tinny bite it was, to be one once. Again I count your daughters, and find myself in the middle, the waste of the hour glass, endlessly passed through and passed through, but holding nothing, dismayed by the grubby February sun I was born under, and the cheap pleasure it gives the window.  Yet I raise the shade for it and try not to feel it is wrong to want spring to be a season further from you. Not wrong to wish for a hard rain, a hard wind like one we sat out in together or came in from together. Here's a poem about a situation which is probably familiar to many working people and this one is particularly about working women and the way that we drag ourselves through the day, sometimes inspired, sometimes exhausted. And I think there is a particular sadness of a woman of a certain age when she begins to realize what she's been doing with her life.  Perhaps hoping for something more. Worked late on a Tuesday night. Again. Midtown is blasted out and silent, drained of the crowd and its doggy day. I trample the scraps of deli lunches some ate outdoors, as they stared dumbly or hooted at us career girls, the haggard beauties, the vivid can dos, open raincoats aflap in the March wind, as we crossed to and fro in front of the public library. Never thought you'd be one of them, did you, little lady? Little Miss Phi Beta Kappa, with your closet full of pleated skirts, twenty nine till death do us part. Don't you see?  Schoolgirl turns thirty, forty, singing the song of time management all day long, lugging the briefcase home. So at ten PM you're standing here with your hand in the air, cold but too stubborn to reach into your pocket for a glove, cursing the freezing rain as though it were your difficulty. It's pathetic, and nobody's fault but your own. Now the tears, down into the collar. Cabs, cabs, but none for hire. I haven't had dinner. I'm not half of what I meant to be. Among other things, the mother of three. Too tired tonight to seduce the father.  The next poem I'm going to read is a poem entitled The Deck, and I think the poem sort of embraces that moment when I realized something that taught me a great deal. The deck. I have almost nailed my left thumb to the two by four brace that holds the deck together. This Saturday morning in June, I've saw two by sixes tea squared and levered everything with three bubbles seal and green glass, and now the sweat on my tongue tastes like what I am.  I know I'm alone, using leverage to swing the long boards into place, but at times it seems as if there are two of us working side by side, like old lovers guessing each other's moves. This hammer is the only thing I owned of yours, and it makes me feel as if I've cottoned it for years. Even the crooked nails are going in straight, the handsail glides to grease, the toe nail studs hold, the deck has risen up around me, and now I'm strong enough to support my weight, to not sway with this old silly wrong footed dance I'm about to throw my whole body into.  From sky to ground. This morning's work can take nearly anything. With so much uproar, punishment, footwork, and euphoria, I'm almost happy this Saturday. I walked back inside and here you are, plain and simple as the sunlight on the tools outside. Daddy, if you'd come back a week ago, a day before yesterday, I would have been ready to sit down and have a long talk with you. There were things I wanted to say, so many questions I wanted to ask, but they've been answered with as much salt and truth as we can expect from the living.  I'd like to read a poem called An Idle Thought, which is the kind of daydream of a woman who's married at twenty one, which I was, and occasionally her mind wanders off to other passions she may have known. And I'd like to preface this by saying that the poem was written well before Monica Lewinsky ever appeared on the scene, so I'm now sometimes embarrassed by it because it contains a fantasy of seducing the president, which in our country, that subject has played out in a very silly way. But it also contains a British character whom listeners here may know, so I don't know if people will agree with me that this person is of some sex appeal. An Idle Thought. I'm never going to sleep with Martin Amos or anybody.  At twenty one, I scotched my chance to be one of the seductresses of the century. A vamp on the rise through the ranks of literary gods and military men, who wouldn't stop at the president. She'd take the Pentagon by storm in halter dress and rhinestone extras, letting fly the breasts that shatter crystal. Then dump him, too, and break his power broker heart. Such women are a breed apart.
