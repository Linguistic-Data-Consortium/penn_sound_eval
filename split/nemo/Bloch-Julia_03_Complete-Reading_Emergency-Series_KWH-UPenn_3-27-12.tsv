She opened her mouth and some dust came out. I am not totally sure what happened between the foyer and the apartment door. I am stammering. I did the treadmill for thirty five minutes. Her legs stuck out of her skirt and she murmured a lot and almost cried, but did not cry one bit. Dear Kelly. All these weddings and their impulse toward the mirror. Sex like a collision we know we should avoid. Wedding is XXXX.  Do you ever hate being American, flying virgin, loving the master? I wander the aisles at Ross in search of a red blouse that ties up at the back. I'm thinking of the hushed motion, the crawl, the dark eye and the answer, the field of light around her palm. Did a lot of shopping at Ross when I was writing these poems. I worked across the street from one, it was kind of dangerous. Sorry, I haven't read from a book before, so I was like, what can I read next?  Dear Kelly, now that I know Sagittarius is in my north node, I have spent the day reading lines in an art gallery, trying to let my brain crawl into them, or at least under some pastoral light. I think I should like to be erased, like a certain word is, from these letters. No, I think I'd like to hold a certain feeling, like a cut thing, with the light shining all around your forehead and the last failed year toppled over at the entrance to one hundred one on Bay Shore. There was a sign there.  Dear Kelly, sweater instead of fear, eyeliner instead of reassurance, cocktail as cough suppressant, real men in real bar. I mean a bar cut like a man. I mean a bar cut like a piano, cut to fit around the piano. I mean a bar cut like a Yamaha baby grand, and a glossy drink, and your lacquered face. And instead of anaphora, I said anathema, and the piano lodged under plexiglass like a big sideways fish, and beneath the mirror is my coat check, is the cusp of your hand, is a mouth moving across the teeth.  Long lines of the sun instead of the wrong side of the bed, in the bed instead of on the floor. I mean in the bed, but not in the bed, at the corner of the mouth, math across the t shirt, and there is no narrow sleep before the portrait of your imaginary wife. So I moved to the other side of the bed, and then to the other side of the apartment, and then from the second floor to the ground floor. I mean the ground. I mean the sidewalk where no one was wearing any costumes, and the cab filled quickly with smoke. Dear Kelly. The runners on the schoolkill, locked in their corridors, pass bits of molded white plastic that carve up the winter air.  Garbage cars on the tracks, the absence of ice, all the city steps I have taken in my foolishly sensible shoes. I can spell words on paper. You think that's all the work you need to do, but you are not yourself, you are not this futurity. When I played in the evening, I was sore in Leyeux. And then I just thought I'd read a few new pieces here.  This is a translation I did of Shakespeare's Sonnet one hundred and twenty, which begins, That You Were Once Unkind Befriends Me Now. And it's called PST Sonnet. When I first moved to LA, they were, I think, just launching this, I think it might still be going on, this huge constellation of art exhibits called Pacific Standard Time. I was thinking a lot about what it meant to move into Pacific Standard Time. Eileen Miles was just reading in LA, and it was a perfect tonic for two I mean, I'm originally from the West Coast.  I feel like an East Coast transplant in LA. And for Allison and I both, for Allison and me both, I think it was very healing to hear from another New Yorker who found it very jarring to be in LA. And one of the things she said was, one of the hardest things about living in California is that you're up late and so you think, great, I can call someone in California. But I'm already here. So I was thinking a lot about Pacific Standard Time. A shaken sense, a glass hug. Even your shirt was lying, your whole body full of liquid. There is a word blocking the bow.  I there is to go very shortly. A there bar. A there sacro iliac joint. Let's to the stone gallery. A video, ball drop, nineteen seventy four, where a ball is becoming light upon a windshield and smash, like that. So let's ransom this hotel. Let's put a fee upon this feeling to various century. Look up all the bones of the body to see what you can spare. Dark, grey, green. Not everything can be sighted. I must needs. Green face lies. Fall apart for the day. Like I said, a glass hug.  And this has a line in it from Bob Proman. I dipped my hand in the garbage can and then I put my finger in my mouth. A sort of first self, best self ideological position. A cold sort of laundry, many masses of cold, unforgivable cold. The shock is how ordinary it seems.  I think that's all the work you needed to do. You think you can mask it, like drinking from the lake. That line exhausts me. Most people are not also adults. And this is the last poem I'm going to read. It's called Allison Corporation. And it's for Allison. Outside the city is a thick line of thinking. And outside that line of thinking is a strip of water. And outside that strip of water is a muscle. Lengthen the muscle.  Restraint and perfect tension. That is Allison Corporation. California is not new. California is not new. California is not new.
