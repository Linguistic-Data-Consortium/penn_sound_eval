So we know going back to Blake, of course, who was such an outsider and printed and engraved, created his own engraving techniques, his own books. But most poets exist within, you know, micro networks of publishers or bookstores that publish their work and that circulate to other poets. And you could sort of trace what those networks are. And I'm not saying network in a contemporary bureaucratic sense. You could trace those connections by looking at the where the books.  Absolutely. Who publishes that? Yeah. So you're really the center center. Yeah. So while you might have found it, I could imagine, quite difficult, 'cause distribution is always a very difficult and unrewarding thing, nonetheless, you learned a lot about what was going on, how things were going on. Well, yeah, I did, and I but I was also I was traveling a bit and visiting libraries, and that's how I was selling the books that we were distributing. People rarely bought anything from a list that we would send out, but if I would go around and visit people in special collections libraries, they would invariably buy many things, maybe. So that's when you got started.  with your relationship with special collections and libraries. That started the distribution. But then I realized when I did the cage book, I knew that if I went around and showed it to people that I would be able to sell this. And so it made it possible having that end point, that end user point in mind. And I'd met a lot of people by then. In the early eighties, I came out and attended the something called Rare Book School. That was a summer program at Columbia University. This was filled with all kinds of languages.  librarians from around the country and elsewhere, studying aspects of rare books. And that was very useful in beginning to meet people, some of them I still know now, all this time. And they were at the beginning of their career then as well. And it may be unfair or a stereotype, but a lot of people involved with rare books for sure, but fine press printing apart from you and Charles Alexander and a few others, and leaving aside the cheaper use of letterpress by Burning Deck or Tumba and others, wouldn't have been interesting contemporary, especially not radical.  innovative poetry they would publish known works and it would be about the way in which those works were printed and set or more conventional writing. So you are combining very radical poetic content, radical in the sense of unconventional and contemporary versus more traditional right work. Yeah, that's why I wanted my interest in the books that we were distributing was limited to the physical aspects of the work.  And the nothing wrong with the content. I don't want to go I love Moby Dick. Yeah, Jeremy. I've sat by famously. Probably more than one. But one of the people you mentioned, it's a beautiful thing to behold, isn't it? Absolutely. It's still not the same as doing a John Cage book, or Jane Brackage book. It's a different kind of thing. But what I'm interested in dwelling on that for a second is the syncretic, which is so important to me in poetics. In your case, the syncretism has to do with combining aspects of a very traditional fine press printing.  knowledge of antiquarian books with this very different content that you put into that. Because a lot of us, I mean, think about stuff that I was publishing as kind of a non publisher, publisher, but still, I mean, we type stuff and we xeroxed it. It was fine. And it has a nice quality to it, and I'm all for it, but a lot more people doing the kind of stuff that I was doing with desktop and the rest. A lot less people, even if they wanted to, could have done what you did because they just wouldn't have known how to do it. Yeah, yeah, but no, it wasn't, you're right, you're right.  There weren't many models really. I mean, Parisable Press published a lot of people, Paul Blackburn, Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley. But he did it in a one, he did it in his way. It was a very perfect way. It was very much in the fine printing tradition. And I think that what Granary does, did and does was to push it further and try to find a proper relationship between all of the materials of the object.  So this becomes a kind of a crossover into what you could call artist books. Now, at what point did you begin to see your work at Granary as the publisher of artist books? Because we haven't used that term up until now, right? We're talking about poetry, fine press, but yet if you're looking at it from twenty twenty one, the first thing that one would say about Granary books, though not the only thing, is that you did artist books. Yeah, I would say that I was aware of artist books in many of the versions of ways of defining them.  That from the so called democratic multiple Rouchet and Sol de Witt and others, the kinds of books you'll see at Printed Matter, as well as poet painter collaborations or
