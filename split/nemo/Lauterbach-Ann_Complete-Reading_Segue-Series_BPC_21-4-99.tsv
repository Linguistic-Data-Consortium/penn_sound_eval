Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_Segue-Series_BPC_21-4-99	0.0	401.86	 is embossed on the stationary, and the sign is dry, turn, swift bearer, brief volition, wing featured at the far, the furthest shore. The dream ascends its microcosm making not sense, and the atavistic goons clash at the edge of the park, sky sky plumed, all prepared for the haunted baliwick of strangers trailing incognito across the tile.  But the light seems musical, lowered against the ridge into extremity. Shift, shift, shift. News of the earth. The fabulous knee deep in mud, fist green, tinsel dripping by degrees, blue shoe left in the meadow, the sentence elongated and drafted onto the unsheltered war zone. It could have been dark, theatre of dark, the unsheltered sentence bloodied, the sky opaque, the glassed in record, the will to rise. Call it the person. Things will go then to sleep as if forgotten, and the difficult will seem easy.  Show the precarious struts, set off bombs from above. There will be no one to count, no two to include, no three to beg for mercy. The trail of time will be easy to follow. Good old oaks, billowing lilies along the roadside, no four to divide, and the valley is incrementally cold, down up, down, down, mediated by the memoirs, fake torture, and the one way war, panic of recognition, dangerous evident sun. But in the slovenly, small eyed dream, surely one of us is victorious, our kisses stamped into wet clay, our harrowing ended in song.  Hurrah, while the small struts of tomorrow fall to ground, and the tears come from afar in new boxes. This is called Marjorie and Forrest in Moscow. I went to a reading, Marjorie Wellesh and Forrest Gander. Marjorie and Forrest in Moscow. Trickily absorbed into ecphrastic juveniles.  Shot from the hip, think I'll listen to Emmy Lou, before the fervor of the Andante. Shostakovich plural and harmonic, but repeated over here in the mud, with the young boys with their tools, their faces sweating with boundary, old goat with his belly, lust for the worldly arena. O woman of emendation, man of domestic glass, come speak to us before our trip, upbraid these vague hems and such quotidian enunciations as the Tao, beyond what we might have witnessed in the early homespun riot before the colossal carried us off into infrastructure.  Inverting the usual designation of boy girl trails, she would track the insignias of thought, thinks the bleachers will hold, he would open each flower, blossom heart, in the applet of a kindly disciple. Moses, one shoe off, rises to the tinsel bush recursive, belonging to her own edition, like a good logic, marries Myakovsky to the sublime, submits her throat to the ear, his entreaty to come through the door, impasto of rival concordance, dance of agreement, trot, trot to the beat.  It's going very quickly. I'm almost done. Let's see, I keep talking about whole fragments, but I really don't know what they are. This was called Fragment Oscillating History and Magic. That's, I think, a reference. I'm so ashamed. About the duty on wine, about the barricades, about the arcades. A mere as if the wine duty in the town gates sponsored.  Palpability, density, crassly and roughly omit, calling things by their names mere facts. But in what shall I believe, now that the sanctions are lifted? The sky was bewitched easily the first time we saw it. Remember, do you, do you, now that it is overcast? Snow fell, yes, stuff kept above, as in a studio set, so that the hero dies, but does not, and the girl radiant beyond, and the girl radiant beyond nature, and the river a blast of withering cloud cast upon the old, captive blue. Will the blue come down to us?  paintings along the V cut into a country road and explained on the wall. So in my computer I have this thing called drafts, poetry, drafts, you know, poetry, drafts, poetry, not drafts, finished poetry, they get sidled over. Maybe you all do this, but I have this long list of drafts. So in desperation I looked in the drafts to see what there might be. Is there drafts that I can draft into, you know, the other condition of the non draft?  So I found this. I thought, oh, this is sort of vaguely interesting. And usually, I mean, again, this is, you know, a confessional moment. Because I don't know in any way what to title any poem, I usually just say what month it is that it's being written in. So, you know, there's a November and there's a December and so this is April.Doc.April.Doc. So sad, really. So much pathos in April.  Oh.
