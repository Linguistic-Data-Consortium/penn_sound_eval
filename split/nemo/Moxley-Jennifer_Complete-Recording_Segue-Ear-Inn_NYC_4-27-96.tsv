Of course, she had last minute revisions here, of course through the age of imaginative memory I may be creating a clearer picture of Helena than I actually saw, or perhaps even overstating my first impression of her. But it remains that over the course of my life I have encountered certain faces that, unlike the other millions that pass by, form a clear and permanent image in my mind. A few such faces belong to people who I only met once, others to strangers, and then of course still others to my closest friends. I can still see Helena's face as though she were sitting right here in front of me, questioning me with her.  the look she wore so often. I never saw this look, nor the essence of her face, captured successfully in a photograph, for it was her movements and changes that made her remarkable. She was, it turned out, exquisitely dependent on the transient energy of an animate life. Whether I knew this the first afternoon, whether I knew that first afternoon she would soon inspire me to great imaginary acts of life is unimportant, for in the realm of the possible ideas are unstable, and the only comfort is, finally, your belief that they are true. Helena's faraway demeanour was always somewhat present.  The poems she brought to class were complex enough to send the rest of us into an unusually lengthy, if full, silence. These poems, usually ten to fifteen lines long, looked clustered and smeared in their small Xerox typewriter face. She signed them in pin as though she were a ship, HM Bennett. She had a peculiar vocabulary and sense of poetic narrative, and as she read I thought I could hear each word weave and twist into the lines and stanzas. Scratched beaks spit in sullen ears unhindered, Thy hands turned newly brittle and to bone.  These lines from her poem Odin's Rovins are the very first that struck me. The hard sounds of the brittle beaks and bones, mixed with the mythological allusions, sent my mind into a whirl. When later I looked up Odin, comma Ravens of, in my Edith Hamilton, I found this The nurse god Odin, unlike Zeus, is a strange and a solemn figure, always aloof. On his shoulders perch two ravens. Each day they fly through the world to bring back bring him back the news of men. One raven is named Thought and the other Memory. The implications of such discoveries made a little wedge in my psyche.  tiny aperture through which uncharted thoughts had a new point of entry. On this recent threshold, thought and memory met up with a barely distinguishable mass of desire, and from then on worked together to perceive this new beauty of created forms. The possibility that poems could be much more than inner feelings began to unfold in my mind, and I saw the poem as a made thing, thought out and constructed no less than the pattern of intricate tapestry. As when I held in my very first snowflake, I was stunned with disbelief to look down and see, out of one frozen drop, the most perfect crystalline form. So my new understanding gave me the clarity I needed.  to write a poem, as Robert Duncan wrote so beautifully, that is not mine, but is a made place. That is mine. It is so near to the heart. Okay. You can tell I'm from California that I just held my first nose like very recently in my life. This is from the second chapter. It's called Echo Oom, which is the secret of hidden intelligence. In this, I'm jumping back into my past. I discovered the duplicitous nature of language quite late in my life. In my family, correct English was possible.  My mother and older brother Robert had a fixed idea about words which were either right or wrong, correctly used or unforgivably misused. Using this strict principle, they created elaborate vocabulary contests to try and catch each other in the middle of an unintentional malopopopism. They sought out obscure words and used cleverly planned conversation topics to showcase these words. My mother would trap my brother and then he would return the favor. As I watched from the sidelines, the two of them turned a large vocabulary into a finely honed tool of intimidation. This vocabulary weapon was compounded when my brother Robert obtained a two volume set of the condensed Oxford English Dictionary.  through a mail ordered book club offer. It came in a blue cardboard casing with a magnifying glass in a long thin drawer at the top. He would sit at our dining room table underneath a wrought iron Mexican chandelier and scan slowly slowly down its pages, chuckling to himself. Then he'd get my attention by saying, Hey Jen, a response to which would inevitably unleash a question such as, Are you a nymphomaniac? It was the continuation of a relationship based on his knowledge and my lack of it that had begun on the day I was born five years younger than he. I was about nine when I finally caught onto the perils of this information imbalance.  Robert had decided to tell me that an orgy was a party where little girls play jacks. I got into big trouble when I asked my mother if my friends and I could have an orgy on the kitchen floor. Growing up thinking language was full of booby traps, so for the express purpose of revealing my ignorance, like a dress that could at any minute fall away. One would think it unlikely I would eventually become a poet. I suppose I must have become addicted to the unique humiliation and constant insecurity, actually growing to love the unstable ground of lingual trap doors, or at least I found a method of navigating through them sufficiently fascinating to outweigh the peril.  My friend Katie and I co founded a good word club, of which we were the only members. We never clearly defined what quality made a word good beyond our simple agreement upon preference for it. How the word sounded was, however, a huge factor in the word good for acceptance into our pantheon and all the ensuing privileges of favored status.
