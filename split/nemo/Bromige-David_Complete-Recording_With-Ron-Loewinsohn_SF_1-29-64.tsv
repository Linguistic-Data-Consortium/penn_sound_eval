Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_With-Ron-Loewinsohn_SF_1-29-64	0.0	434.44	 At other times, the fans in the stands get a souvenir, arguing as they were a minute previous among themselves, putting money on the next pitch at eight to five, turning suddenly and raising the hands to grab the home run ball, still warm from the pitcher's hand, and turning as fluidly to collect his bet, adjusting his cap. It's very distinct at the ballpark. The players play ball, the umpires arbitrate, the groundskeepers manicure the grounds, watering the base pads with grave sylph like movements. They're all regally ignorant of the spectators.  Watching, among other things, their actions, their efforts, their cheers, their jeers fall on deaf ears. The young Dominican pitcher surveys his outfield vibrant green under the lights Este es mi parque. The cheers of the patron rain, the cheers of the patrons rain down on his deaf ears. At the ballpark, it's all very distinct. This one is called Vision of Childhood.  The rain tonight on the mountain outside my window, on the street, on the freeways of California, on the farms in the Livermore Valley, raining tonight in Placerville where my wife's father was born, the black water on the mountain here, five hundred yards beyond my window, the water cutting its own sluices in the soil of California. I forget what I was talking to him about in the dream, my son, the age of three, about the people who'd come to California in the past.  They sailed in wooden ships around the Horn or walked beside their oxen across the Sierras, all that energy spent, some vision, some getting, whether it was the gold that got them here or the soil or even the weather, which even today the magazines extolled, our soon to be biggest state. The governor in his press releases, his census estimates, the streamings over the borders of California, the several chambers of commerce, a perfect environment for all ages from the cradle to the grave. And he said, but I didn't come.  His mother, an advertising copywriter whom I divorced, had just returned with him from New York. I came through the canal. Why, of course, it seemed in the dream obvious to me, knowing the anatomy of America. Someone was ironing a workshirt for me in the hallway outside that room. And then the letter from his mother. He was sitting at breakfast playing with ten bright shiny new pennies all lined up in a row, all the Lincoln heads up, all looking the same way. He straightened up, looked all the Lincolns in the eye and said, oh, kidding.  Okay, you guys smile. This one is I hope he's not here. This one is about a barber that I used to go to. I had my hair cut pretty regularly on the bottom end of Columbus Avenue. It's called the Fortunate Barber.  Barber hones his razor. He says he remembers back to Prohibition. Elmer, the barber, tells about the horrors. Oh, those corpses, those barbary coast days. At his age, his white hair, the red veins of his face, sex and liquor seem to be his main concerns. This friend of mine's window faced the hospital, these two nurses giving it to each other with a rubber cock. Sex and liquor fill his talk, his Sundays with his married daughter in Walnut Creek, her kids, beatniks, queers, foreign cars, those track stars.  They're all black, those fucking shines. The red cheeks of his granddaughter, his Irish week, his nights in front of the TV, his wife wakes him when he falls asleep and they turn off the set and go to bed. Almost every time there's someone, I cut his hair last week, next thing I hear he took a heart attack. One brother's dead, an alcoholic who fell down once and bled all over Elmer's car in the barber's eyes that day. A second brother hassled with the VA. I saw that one shuffle out of the place one afternoon.  Fortunate barber reads the newspaper. He stands in his doorway. He watches me go by, the back of my neck, the hair around my ears from day to day. The travel agent next door is another customer and most of the cops back and forth from Central Station. We walk by the shop throughout the week and he looks at the backs of our necks and our ears out there abroad in the May Street. This one's called Flowers because they've come to be.  Late blooming marigolds, nasturtiums, daisies yawning on a Sunday morning in the sunlight. It's October. We woke up this morning and they started putting the world together. The sunlight on the wall, in your hair, your eyes blinking, the air outside my window, nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, late blooming marigolds, daisies yawning on a Sunday morning. You've entered this hall. You're leaning against the door jamb. You've taken off your shoes. The abstractions fall away like shadows.  Shoes lying there by the door to my kitchen. You walk over to the window where I'm looking down at the houses across the street, the colors of their roofs, late blooming marigolds, daisies yawning on a Sunday morning in the sunlight, the rooftops, the tar flowers, the shingles bloom, the tiles burgeoning. It's October. We woke up this morning and they started putting the world together, that fog to the north hiding what hasn't been made yet. By this afternoon, aquatic park will have been created.
