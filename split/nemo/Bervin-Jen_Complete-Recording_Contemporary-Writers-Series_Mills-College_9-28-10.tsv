It happens at times that come to us in a direct line as light moving at a pretty pace. People in delirium run toward it. It has one of nature's failings. Loveliness is not the less when it's uncertain. Strange we have come back.  So this type study is what started all the trouble with Annie Albers for me. I'd long been a fan of her work and had on weaving and knew it well. And I just saw it differently one day and I went to some lengths to try to publish it in Jubilat, which is one of the other things that I do. I edit there. And it put me in touch with the Albers Foundation, which opened up a little bit of a Pandora's box.  They brought out so many amazing things when I went to visit. I was then in. So I studied weaving and then started working on my own little type studies. And I don't know about you, but when I do monotonous work like hammering away on a gridded typewriter space like this, I'm always listening to things. So at this point I was listening to a really amazing interview with Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein. It's one of that very early line break interviews where they just they have this stellar conversation about landscape.  Page Space, where Susan Howe equates page space to freedom. It's not Pennsylvania. This is Annie and Joseph at Black Mountain College. And this is Lauren Linfield, one of Annie's students, one of the few people to graduate from Black Mountain.  And she took the weaving course from Annie and from another teacher there and thankfully kept like two hundred pages of extraordinary notes, all hand typed with lots of draft notation and drawings. And while I was at the Albert's Archive or lecture a little bit thereafter, I digitized her entire file because it was deteriorating rather rapidly and maybe of lesser value than some of the other things there. So I scanned it and I have it and now I'm just wondering.  Wondering what to do. I'm going to give a talk in a few days on that archive. But like other projects, it takes me a long time to sort of get far enough that I know what I'm doing with something. So I just spend a lot of time learning. I did trace the type studies from Black Mountain back to the Bauhaus. This is a weaving cloth sample book of some of the type designs. This is my favorite Bauhaus study done by Haja Rose of just zeroes and lines.  This is a million random digits. I think John Cage used this quite a bit, Jackson. So those of you who weave or might weave would know that weaving is all about numbers. So every thread, every intersection of a thread corresponds to at least two numbers. So even though you're looking at a very simple piece of cloth, you could really draw it out numerically in its entirety. So the piece that I did for the.  The book was simply a transcription, a woven transcription of that page space. I was giving a talk recently and I did a little homework on etymology of text and textile and they come from the very same stem to weave. But I love that text actually has even a more fabric description of style, tissue of literary work, literally that which is woven web, texture.  It's so nice. I mean, it's there, there early on. But we could open it up to questions. I think there's plenty of time. I'm hearing about the digging symptoms. I noticed from the images that there were, it seemed to be increasing with the other symptoms, but with similar markings.  But they're slightly different. They correspond to a certain thing from the work. Like the way that you sew the fabric in, it's like how did you figure out what was in there? Right. It's as faithful a transcription as I can make. So what I did was I scanned Dickinson's manuscript books, which you have here, you have a fantastic Dickinson collection. So it's a two volume book of the folio work that she did. And there are actually a ton more of her manuscripts.  that aren't in that edition, so that are far more beautiful even than strange, the light fragments. But I looked at that because it shows a variant system. So all those crosses that you saw embroidered precede words, and the words correspond to other words preceded by a cross within the poem. So there's this rather intense system of alternate or other ways to read poems. And they're very strange. I mean, sometimes they're close, like further and farther, which aren't really close at all.  And sometimes they're like, um, like the line is like, 'Tis as if our souls absconded suddenly, and the variant is souls, and the variants below the poem are world, selves, and sun. So either any of those could happen. And then when you start to read the variants between poems, so say souls is a variant more than once, then you have a very complex way that you start to get to read her thing.
