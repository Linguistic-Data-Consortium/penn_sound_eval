Sze-Arthur_Complete-Recording_UPenn_12-5-06	0.0	391.54	 Whitecaps untiel water. A few freighters zigzag down from the black sea. Sunlight flares at the edges of leaves. Heat ripples up from the noon street and from rusted car tops. The salt in the air stings my eyes. I lift a latch, step into a patio, bird of paradise in bloom. But approaching the window, I find peeled paint, cobwebs. It's dingy inside. I turn, wade into sleep. Do as you're told scumsuckers.  You're the reason there are hydrogen bombs yelled at the postal worker behind the counter. It leopards the body. Cringes at strangled ant eaters and raccoons hanging in the market. It leopards the body. Wakes to pulverized starfish in his shoes. It leopards the body. Disinterred a man and woman sealed for one thousand eight hundred fifty five years under jade plaques stitched with gold thread. It leopards the body. Winced at hundreds of cicadas stridulating in his shoes.  The umbrella pines. It leopards the body. Placed a blackbird with a red gash in the trash bin. It leopards the body. Catches lamb shank in the smoke. It leopards the body. Recovers a red tulip from inside a corkscrew dream. It leopards the body. Combusts when the candlelight touch. It leopards the body. Cars clunk as they drive off the ferry at Chinokele. You walk up the steps.  and find a double peristyle with a deep entrance porch filled with columns. At the base of the columns is an octagonal set of carved dragons, mermaids, and palmettes. You turn, stride down a dark and narrow vaulted ramp that emerges with blinding light into a large hall open to the sky. A continuous frieze on three walls has a central acanthus flanked by griffins and lyres. At the far end, roped off by string, is the foundation of an inner temple with steps that drop to a wall.  When you walk toward the sanctum and look back, you see stairs to the platform of Epiphanes at the rear. You gaze up to the top of a sixty five foot column, step up to the cord, but can't get near enough to see if the spring is dry or wet. You hunger for insight into the precarious nature of becoming. Gaze at the woman you love, whet at how passion is water from a spring. Realize that yesterday, exhausted, you are not going to come this far.  Day having come, you have sunlight in your hands. Because one stirred the entrails of a goat immolated on an altar. Because a magpie flicks tail feathers. Because blood rushed tulips bloomed on the walkway. Because one speaks without fear of reprisal. Because a man crushed in the debris of aluminum doors, steering wheel, dashboard, shivered windshield bleeds and moans. Because he had to visualize black petunias in order to spot black trumpets.  Because he slowly bites the back of her neck. Because an eagle glides over the courtyard with outstretched wings. Because a woman fasted, chewed laurel leaves, swayed in noon heat, stammered, the here is always beginning. Because she brushes her hair across his eyelids. Because bells tinkle around the necks of goats. Because the ruins of this moment are chalk white dust in your hands. Because a grain of sand lodged.  Because loss is a seed that germinates into all things are full of gods. Because a circle opens in all directions. Nine purple irises bloom in a triangular glass vase. A pearl forms in an oyster. She folds a prayer and ties it to a green cryptomeria branch. Threaded sponges are hanging in the doorway. A slug crawls along a railroad tie.  Upstairs suffused the house with longing. Silk tree leaflets fold up when touched. Waking out of her coma, she vowed, I will dip my hands in ink and drag them across white mulberry paper. A hummingbird sipping at a columbine darted off. Red mullets thrash in the water. One casts to the end of time. She wore gold hooped earrings with her black dress. Urnchards were incorporated into the stone walls.  of houses. They swam in the Aegean. Blossoming yellow for Scythia is the form and pressure of the hour. Thank you.
