Wisher-Yolanda_Complete-Recording_8-4-16	0.0	455.72	 Cross Ludlow, past the mailbox on the corner. Risque video, Dino's pizza, and the emerald laundry mat. The fruit trucks tucked into forty fourth Street on the left. House eyes shut with boards, fringes of children. Once we went into a store sunk into the street, owned by a Cambodian woman. She sold everything, from evening gowns to soup. Over to Walnut and forty fifth, where the Muslim cat sells this chicken wrapped in pita, draped in cucumber sauce. The pregnant woman behind the counter writes our order out in Arabic. We grab a juice from the freezer.  Some chips. I, the bean and sweet potato pies. Back into the hot breath of West Philly, sun is setting. The sky is smeared squash, tangerines in a glaze. Three girls and one boy jump double dutch. A white man hustles from the video store with a black plastic bag. We look for money in the street, steal flowers from the church lawn. The shit stain from the wino is still on our step. mister Jim is washing a car for cash. John is cleaning his rims to boujou bontan. Noel is talking sweetly to the big blue eyed woman. Linda on her way to the restaurant.  The sister in the wheelchair buzzes by with her headphones on. One night a man was shot and killed on this block, right outside our thick wood door, but not today. Today is one of those days to come home from walking in the world, leave the windows open, start a pot of black beans, smoke some Alice Coltrane, cut up some fruit, toenails, hold on to the moment, as if time is taking your blood pressure.  I have this feeling that my heart will break from the knowing of you. So every day I will hold myself to the fire of love and sing you the lullabies of my dreams. And even as I hold you, I will divine and fashion my heart for the letting go, imagining space without your scent, your newness. I will send the ashes of all the ghosts who threaten our feast to the winds that run counter.  This feeling that the deepest cracks in my heart will be cemented with joy. First poem at forty. Today I am forty. The years have added up. Virginia's slim sayings pepper the air. I wear my womanhood like a shirling on the subway. Royal minx in the bathroom of suburban station. I am here. I am still here. I have not been broken beyond repair. I am purple onion.  Red lemon, lead paint on the window sill, the web between toes. I want to write bishop poems about fish for the next forty years, and who will stop me? Who will stand in my way? Certainly not the ghost who visit in my sleep, certainly not some half formed girl of my nightmares, only me. I am the grind and the force, I am the turning wheel, the luminous walk of water along the river of a curb. I am Yavanda's daughter, and better and cold for it. The grandfather clocks are chanting songs about my secondhandedness.  My two headedness, my third womb, no gurus to pull out my teeth, no kites to hang my woes upon, I am the fray in the string before it splits, I am the break in my own heart, this is forty, this is forty, my love, you dear, gone baby girl, gone woman child, gone the old ladies who'd with me laugh about my lazy loins, Miss Y'all. THE PERFORMER.  You go fishing for strangers. You want to write something full of alchemy that'll make people sit up in their chakras and go, Make somebody remember you for ages when you leave the room. Not fight your way through the crowd but mingle and descend like tar residue from the ceiling. You want to leave a trace of yourself on the cotton of people. You want the band to know your name, the mic to know your mist, the poem to pull your strings and make you dance. Can you make a match strike behind their eyes? Can you make the walls wail?  Ailing from their beds, like a brother all in white, like a big woman spitting up rats and wash boards on the bandstand, bosom heaving with a bull weevil's song, you bring the belt that lashes the back of everyone's soul, and when you finish, everybody feel weary, everybody go home, think about love, or make it. My grandmamma's house is the EPA.  Call this place home, and there's hella pay. Shady lane banks still peep, or scribs away, Police departments acting like the KKK. Turn coach treat my prayers like a runaway. We rock the mask and hoodie like a gambo ray. But can't be no union when our black asses ain't okay. Shall we wait for the whiz to change the color of the day, While witches of doom rain on our hey hey hey? I'm just the black girl sipping ninety four due belay, Plotting over a mean double crochet, How to make my grandma's house the USA. Gonna wear my love like combat boots and berets. See them doctors.  This can't save you but your grandma may. See them doc, this can't save you but your grandma may. See them doc, this can't save you. Dido Mandingo grew up in the Bay of Montego. Child of martyrs said he'd rather be my hero. Reinvent me in the coves of Montenegro. Bilingual, he altered the way of my lingo. His tongue had a style so insistent.  Untied my vines and bewitched my mango. Aye. The road he took to slay all my doubts.
