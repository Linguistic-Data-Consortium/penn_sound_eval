This is our jubilation, exalted and as old as that truthfulness which illuminates speech. Like the wind in the trees and the bells of the procession, how light the areas and the earth, children in the grass, and the wind in the voices of men and women to be carried about the sun forever, among the beautiful particulars of the breezes, the papers blown about the sidewalks. A female will to hide the most evident God under a cover, surely infinite thing. Surely infiniteness is the most evident thing.  Is it the courage of women to assume every burden of blindness themselves, intruders, carrying life, the young women, carrying life unaided in their arms, in the streets weakened by too much need of too little, and life seeming to depend on women burdened and desperate as they are? Or define man beyond rescue of the impoverished, solid whole cities before we can face again the forests and prairies. Though the world is the obvious, the seen, and unforeseeable.  That which one cannot not see, which the first eyes saw. For us, also each man or woman nears knowledge, though it may be of the noon's own security, and the mad too speak only of conspiracy and people talking, and if those paths of the mind cannot break, it is not the wild glare of the world even that one dies in. Approach the window as if to see the border which disclosed everything. I should have written not the reign of a nineteenth century.  Century day with the motes in the air, the dust here still. What have we argued about? What have we done? Thickening the air? Air so thick with meth, the words unlucky and good luck float in it? To see them? No. Or seize motes. An iron mesh, links of consequence still at the mind's end, relevant. You are the last who will know him, nurse, not know him. He is an old man, patient. How good will know him? You are the last who will see him or touch him.  Nurse, occurring neither for self nor for truth, the sad marvels, the least credible circumstance, storm of bombardment, or the room of a very old man. Whitman, nineteenth, eighteen sixty four. The capital grows upon one in time, especially as they have got the great figure on top of it now, and you can see it very well. It is a great bronze figure, the genius of liberty, I suppose. It looks wonderful towards sundown. I love to go and look at it. The sun when it is nearly down shines on the headpiece, and it dazzles and glistens like a big star.  It looks quite curious. That's the end of it. I make some awkwardnesses that it's difficult to foresee. It's hard to read and harder still to listen to more poetry now. Do you want to just sit down and not talk for a while? Make a five minute admission, three minute admission.  I at least will smoke. All right. I have a little short poem called a preface. This is a good time to read it. Very short poem. If he goes rowing in the park, though he may row so well that he seems to be ice skating around the lake, he cannot go round that lake forever. An open voyage is another matter, it is own affair, and he knows it.  A poem, a short poem called I keep warning you now, this show, and I'll promise you. It's called Historic Punk. La Petit Ville, a young man called it later, had been the last thing offered in that way. A way of behaving, a way of being in public, which we lacked. If there was doubt, it was doubt of himself. Finding a force in the cafes and bistros. Force of the familiar, and familiar is the force of these. They gather on the steps of Sacracur, great crowds sitting on the steps to watch the sunset and the lights. I speak of tourists, but what we see is there.  So we will have nothing, neither faith nor will, nor will, touched by the dazzle. Spring touches the beauty of Chamou. Every morning the children appear in the parks. Paris is beautiful and ludicrous. The leaves of every tree in the city move in the wind. The girls have beautiful thighs, beautiful skirts, all simulate courage, samite, to find a way for myself. Oh, and in connection, because that's Paris. I wrote a poem which is really about a reviewer.  No. Because that was Paris. I've been insulted in Saint Peter's, battered in Saint Paul's, and hanged in the Place de la Concorde. There is one who admires my urbanity. There is one in the forest or one in the desert who envies my urbanity. It is true, and it is remarkable, those old walls give shelter. This is a battle. Astrologers and lexicons, once in the great houses.  A poor lobsterman met by chance on Swan's Island, where he was born. We saw the old farmhouse, propped and leaning on its hilltop, on that island where the ferry runs. A poor lobsterman, his teeth were bad. He drove us over that island in an old car, a well spoken man, hardly real, as he knew in those rough fields, lobster pots in their gear, smelling of salt. The rocks outlived the classicists, the rocks in the lobstermen's huts, and the sights of the island, the ledges in the rough sea, seen from the road, and the harbour, and the post office. Difficult to know what one means, to be serious, and to know what one means.  of public quality, his wife in the front seat, in a soft dress such as poor women wear. She took it that we came. I don't know how to say, she said. Not for anything we did, she said. Mildly from God, she said. What I like more than anything is to visit other islands. This called Power the Enchanted World is a series of five very short terms. Streets in a poor district, crowded, we mean the rooms. Crowded, they come to stand in vacant streets, streets vacant of power, therefore the irrational roots.  We are concerned with the given that come before the swallow dares, the winds of March, black winds, the gritty winds, mere squalls and rags. There is a force we disregarded and which disregarded us. I wanted friends who talked of a public justice, very simple people. I forget what we said. Now we do most of the killing, having found a logic which is controlled.
