The user friendly exhibit was installed on street corners along South ninth Street and East Pasiank Avenue and between Carpenter and Twelfth Streets. So the seven figures give a thumbnail sketch. Father Antonio Isoleri was an Italian immigrant who became pastor of the first Italian parish in the United States, Saint Mary Magdalene de Pazzi. His service as a spiritual and secular leader from eighteen seventy to nineteen twenty six.  six was instrumental in shaping the future of South Philadelphia's Italian American community. The church remains a worship site while maintaining its Italian identity to this day. Its former rectory serves as the Mario Lanza Institute and Museum honoring the tenor who used to sing the Ave Maria in his old church. Dorothy Allen is the daughter of West Indian and African American parents and was born and raised in South Philadelphia. She is the founder of the Barrett Educational Center in Point Breeze and worked to provide food, social services, job training and a safe haven for children and teens in the neighborhood.  Bill McIntyre formed part of the South Philadelphia community since the area's earliest days. By eighteen twenty, the area around South Street contained nearly three quarters of Philadelphia's African American population. Many newcomers settled west of Broad Street in Point Breeze during the Great Migration of the twentieth Century. Bill McIntyre was a longshoreman and a master welder for the Independent Pier Company. He marched as a comic in the Mummers Parade for many years before founding the Shooting Stars Fancy Brigade, the parade's first fancy brigade. He paraded with his neighbors on New Year's Day for seventy three years.  This back to mid seventeenth century roots. The New Year's traditions of South Philadelphia's first settlers, the Swedes, blended with the traditional mummer's play of the British Isles. After more than a century of informal merrymaking, the first official parade was in nineteen oh one. Fabiola Canto works as an accountant for Marriott Hotels. She helps organize Philadelphia's Virgin of Guadalupe celebration. She was also an active participant in negotiations to increase communication between the Philadelphia Police and South Philadelphia's Mexican community. This community established around the Italian market and is mainly from the state of Pueblo.  The Mexican population in South Philly has grown exponentially since two thousand one. This is due in part to migration from New York City in the wake of the september eleventh attacks. Frank Snock was the son of Polish immigrants. In the early twentieth century, he boxed under the name Johnny Coffee. The young fighter made enough money to open Snocky's oyster house, a neighborhood landmark that has thrived over one hundred years and counting. During the greatest influx of European immigration into Philadelphia, the Washington Avenue wharves were owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. They served as a docking point for ships to unload oysters.  food, finished goods, workers, and future Americans that would travel by train through the city and around the country. Bao Win is a Vietnamese refugee and a respected elder in South Philadelphia's Southeast Asian community. Active member as a volunteer, she teaches traditional Vietnamese cooking classes to young people and promotes health screening for aging immigrants. South Philadelphia has been one of the chief destinations for the Vietnamese immigration in the USA since nineteen seventy five. Philadelphia has a higher percentage and numerical population of Vietnamese than New York City.  Lebanese immigrant grandparents established the family's roots in South Philly, where they opened the legendary Middle East restaurant. An accomplished percussionist who learned his musical craft while working in his family business, Joe has performed across the United States, Europe, and North Africa. The Lebanese community in South Philadelphia dates back to the eighteen eighties. Father Isfahan Korkamas established Saint Marin's, the United States' first Maronite church in nineteen eighty seven. It's located at Tenton Ellsworth since nineteen oh one.  So I got confused. And it continues to play a vital role in the lives of Philadelphia's Lebanese American community. So that's the background. And whatever we feel like is a feel good event. So you can feel good about paintings that speak with their eyes. Feel good about Rome, even though it's far, far away.  It's something we can agree to feel good about. You can feel a poet as priest slash priest as poet. Feel good about smiles at the gates of heaven and Garibaldi as well. Feel good about the ballad of Antonio Isoleri. The icon's eyes have moved to guide a young man into spirit, to direct a poet from the smile of God and give a new father a mission. I am crossing Alps and ocean. Philadelphia awaits. La Superba falls from view from the parish windows around him.  world of faith in what there is to become. What is to become of Montrose Street but to be built as a beam between cultures? The church's saint, a mystical nun, her pastor, a temporal shepherd. On the feast day, her doors open to railroad workers walking the picket for justice. On Sunday, he rails against exploiting our children as slaves. You can still hear echoing whispers, Patria unita under tricolor, unita via the festa. Calabria, Sicily, Abruzzo, Malise, unita before him in marriage.  Shh.
