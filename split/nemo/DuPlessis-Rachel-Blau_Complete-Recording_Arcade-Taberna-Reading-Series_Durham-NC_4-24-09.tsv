DuPlessis-Rachel-Blau_Complete-Recording_Arcade-Taberna-Reading-Series_Durham-NC_4-24-09	0.0	394.11	 Balancing unsteadily on something impalpable. All things, their else and verge, their costs and lines of providence, be stark in the world in which all that heartbreaking brightness will crack. Day by day I resist morning, yet it catches, wrenches, twists, and trips me, trips me. I fall into it, no place remaining, den den bleiben is nirgens, and stand nowhere, though temporarily here, riden, riven through, tight astride, the no of yes.  inside a stranger's starker yes of no. Remarks. That gust of pulsing wide and fast, plunging crosswise, push and change that made this mark, this slash mark, this other slash mark, like any brightness blown any wing or leaf. I wanted to say it was Parnassus Nemosyne clouded Apollo for its fancier name, which wasn't true. It was just a swallowtail in which the word memory do not appear nor the touch of poetry. Just ordinary, not endangered, no more than anything. Blustered with cross drafts.  It holds tight. Creamy yellow, black lines and marks, like letters on a page, shimmered in the wind and light, and ribbon wings with bright thought dots, blue jot, red spot, rainbow, quick blue eyes. I kept losing my place in the book. It hinged, opened, and closed, as if the letters touching read the word, the word, the text. Gripping down, it snorkels sweetness precariously in transit. But losing the book with a Keats sonnet, a painful sign. When we're in rough cut, and I had to teach such statements of looming as bright star, would I were when we had it?  I hadn't begun to process loss, it blew me away. Writing is impossible, reading is sadness, a word or sentence intervoid. It all could be summarized as aftermath. This well known dream genre is well attested, yet little consolation. The recklessness of life inside itself, the double turn of throes, of throes of faith, the crosshatches of bluster, the two steep roads, the energy in wind and wing, all were intercut so fast when I hadn't time to register this time except as ripped.  What is is, what's torn is all. We're coming here with pieces of people we lost, their shadows tangled in the long vigil of the page. There was no readiness for the call. This it emerged, almost unseen, lurking, films of gray with scrims of untrackable isms shadowed under persons, apples, wall, under fold, under the scratched ink of palipsest, and under those tricky transcode systems, setting numbers to letters, then words to those sums. That pyramid of A becomes zero. Now read the newborn letter.  A stranger, a stranger universe. It will be palpable, yet balancing, who knew how, on something impalpable. This really is a documentary. All things, their elves and verge, their costs and lots and lines of provenance, the n's and y's and x and place and r's, stark in the world in which all that heartbreaking brightness will break again day by day. I say I resist morning, this mass of mixed hungers and desperate outcomes, and yet it catches, wrenches, twists and trips me, trips me. I fall into no place.  Remaining Dane Bleiben isn't you against what? Simply to be is not in being rooted but be blown away, be riding, riven, further out than loss, tight astride the no of yes, the no of yes that shadows thought, inside a stranger, starker yes of no, the yes of no that calls outright to a no matter whether a is there or not. The quotation we're coming here with pieces of people we lost was stated actually by a woman.  a woman named Norma Gabriel Taylor at the inauguration of Barack Obama and it was cited by Matt Matt Sal Dania in an article maybe. Very durable. Very, very durable. And I'm happy to have it actually. Okay. I'd like to read, it's going to be a little tight here. I'd like to read a kind of very ecstatic poem like the others weren't, right?  It goes along. It looks it's very big on the page, so it's kind of a little risky behavior. And it's on the line of two, which is redness. The line of two is always redness. There's a couple of different second poems in this. One is that it has these kinds of things every once in a while. Another is that it has some words in parentheses next to other words. And a third is it actually has rubrics, which is the title of the poem. Big things in capital letters that spell out a secret message, but not a very subtle one. Actually. But it is just another poem.  And it should, I think I'm going to try to read it very fast, but it's a very fast poem. Okay, draft ninety seven, rubrics. If the red streak of honey in the mouth, if that rush, fathoming up in fullness, if the welling of sound, the enclosed honey hold thickens, resistant to flow, yet flowing despite we are in time, whose henadark touch smears with plenitude and echo. If there is speaking song, multiple exposure to the bright debris enters it.
