Ah, swoony, queasy feel, as you squeeze lightly now my balls, the strong odor of his own urine. Standing over an open ditch in the pouring rain, think of the word gully washer. My bones are aching and my brain is weak. I think I'm standing on a stubborn street. Moment at dawn when the sky has lightened, minute before the first sun appears when all light begins.  True light, every color muted. Pieces of a music hidden in the mind by memory's collaboration with all other musics emerges now, emerges again anew in the middle of a dream, every song a new song, each now heard for the first time. Today I wake with a roaring thirst. We put the fab in fabric. All effects are special. You'll wake the birds. Two wakes, twin twenty five pound barbells resting on the rug implicit challenge. The roses have grown wild in the corner, rising high.  This compost is a small mountain, out of whose sides weeds arise, steam wisps over the lip of the cup, hot tea at the brink of a hot day. It's summertime, so that after an early evening movie the sun's still out, the day crowded with hours gathers at the horizon, an intricate dream in which I return to an old job site, peopled now by my current coworkers. Both move miraculously to a mining town in the Sierras. About ankle tiny sparrow chases huge vulture high over the freeway, zigzag path out by the way.  A walkway connects buildings over the street, which from twelve stories up, I look down upon. Old brick buildings of Larimer Square, all goo gawed up boutiques for tourists that stay open till nine at night. What is morning for? Form sets the reader's expectations, laying the ground for a happy or unhappy reading experience. A sentence late forgotten under the tree by the reservoir's edge. Bird in the dark this morning, my lip is blistered. Weight bends the sunflower, smell of fog. Imagination seizes power, but power buys imagination.  One bad habit is to leave underwear on the scale in the bathroom. Today a squirrel sits atop the sunflower pulling seeds out one by one. Fuchsias open, their pale pink outer petals turn up. That was a dream this is not. I'm not really traveling by submarine to a conference in Europe of paint stores. I'm trying to imagine what it will feel like when the surgeon cuts mine eye. Mockingbird imitates trio of crickets, then quiets once the sun rises. Standing, the blood rushes to my feet. Old familiar river. Notebooks, phones, forms. The day is warm.  Stain circles the shirt. In her private life, the old actress, now senile, was a surrealist. We pick our way through the cobwebbed residue of her home. Showers steam fogs my glasses. Lift the dead tree stump back into the back of the truck. Quickly the fireworks settle into a terrible sameness. The way a swarm of connotations settles in once you know the supposed to mean in the dream, where do I find it? Being a village explainer, I'm always happy to come upon a village. It's an old bus that travels between these small farm towns so far apart.  I disembark just to run into the store and fetch something to fix the zipper on the shoulder bag. But all my suitcases slow me down. And when I get back outside, it's long gone. Another not due for days. Often the dream dissolves instantly as I stumble for the alarm clock and light switch, leaving behind as a residue an emotional tone. I was being threatened, or there was a puzzle to solve, or I'd been abandoned by a bus. One difference with waking is that in dreams, I see clearly, sharply. I never wear a glasses. The one word I remember is Chadwick. It's not the details.  We're staring off into an amber horizon, trying to foretell the weather. Is a hurricane coming alongside three steamer trunks, each of which contains three bad guys unconscious, clad only in their skibbies. Then I wake up, a Roy Orbison song obsessively in my head, but the linkages between them offer no sensible verb. Suppress the impulse to name that tune. The two other people trapped in the elevator are a young man who's been in bed four days with the flu and an older woman who's a receptionist in a doctor's office somewhere in the building.  What spider could have spun a web so thick, so filmy, so strong? The first horizon of a sore throat, first burst of light that occurs over the kitchen over the bathroom sink is absorbed, refracted, swelling into the eye. Wind bends the brambles between the fence and the shed, a sound more like scraping than rustling as a train muscle hoots somewhere to the west. A solution thick as honey is poured into the eye, then the plastic cylinder inserted, standing upright in this base without actually touching the surface. A woman I haven't seen in fifteen years.  fifteen years, haven't thought of it in ten, a misshapen thing who wrought havoc in our political collective until we expelled her without, I believe, her even comprehending that that's what we've done returns in the dream as officious and anxious as ever. William Berry cheesecake right before bed enhances the effect.
