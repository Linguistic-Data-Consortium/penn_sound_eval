Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	0.0	432.1	 Forward and to the right. Zeroing in on. A rhythm of speech that moves from heart to heart, zeroing in on, and in the moment unable to hold on to it, the suspension a kind of start, way classic in its sundry appeal, that accordion way of life, people sitting everywhere, to walk in and see all those people. Not even. I stumbles and falls, becomes an empty underscore, italicizing nothing. Hundreds of thousands of email messages, gone forever, deeply buried.  Varied and unwound time. Flickering. I'll get right on it. Get it right. And that's not what I heard. Reading by hand. Writing in pencil lasts longer. Pick something up and try to figure out how it works, say a digital camera. Consult the manual. Writing is the same way. Reading by hand. But I'm so lazy. Don't want to worry. I stay alone at night. The writer has one subject. It is the act of being alone. The sky is brilliant. Huge cumulous clouds mass above the lake.  Writing goes its own way. You have to supply the synthesis. The sound of car doors closing. The sound of car doors closing, and voices from the street. An engine starts up, revving to pull away, down to the corner and gone. In the silence that follows, train whistle sounds. Who listens? Then jet noise overhead. Who stays behind to report? And who, in some other time and place, quietly waits to hear word? Up front. Writing in place, the illusion of movement meets the illusion of standing still.  encounter with rhythm, counting time in a forest of symbols, batter up, throwing a few change ups, whatever's working that night, replacing Mark Redman as part of the double switch. This isn't about me. This is for you men, you women out there. A train comes into the picture. Picture a group of men walking along beside it. Later, Clint drives the train through a saloon. Jet noise trails away, going to great lengths, riding up front on the handlebars. This train. Driving that train, the words book.  You stare glassy eyed at the onrushing terrain, ain't no more Cain. The essentials scatter all over the parking lot, the rhythm of the rails, cows disappear out the window, you'll never know how much I love you, you'll never know how much I care. Light winds teasing the upper branches, the silver rings. The medium blue topaz spoke to her, and when she looked more closely displayed its laughter. The theoreticians of empire tripping over the symmetries of their own semantics,  The entrepreneurs paddling like eager surfers vying for position near the crest of the next wave. The voices on the street at night calling out to one another. The athletes crouching on their benches half following the action, awaiting their turns. The young mothers bearing their children on their hips at poolside. The thin old woman in tight jeans tightrope walking along the curb of the driveway showing off. Don't want this train ride to end. When you get to the end, you want to hit restart. Or as, when kids playing guns, we used to say,  When shot, I'm a new man. The words book. And I'm going to conclude with a prose piece that's pretty new, and it's part of the Grand Piano, which is a collective, what do we call it, an experiment in collective autobiography. And some of you may be aware of it or may have read some of it. It's an autobiographical work by ten poets who knew each other and still know each other, but who were working in San Francisco.  in the late seventies. And it's been coming out, we've been working on it since I think about two thousand. I mean, it's been almost ten years now, and through correspondence on the internet. And I guess about three years ago, we started completing it and getting it out. And it's been published in a series of small books. I didn't bring a copy, but they're quite beautifully designed. They're kind of nice pocket size. And each one has one section by each of the ten poets. And there will be ten when we finish, which will be with the next one.  And most of the pieces are our memoir. But everybody kind of approaches it from a different angle. And I've found that in doing it, I sort of have to reinvent how I do it every time. So I'm going to read the latest one, and this one, I guess, is just out. I haven't seen it yet, but it's part nine. And in this one, it's more of an essay about sort of the problematics of writing autobiography and thinking about memory and thinking about time, thinking about the time in which the story takes place.  which is kind of back in the day and then the time in which the writing has taken place which really has covered almost a ten year period. And in fact this piece was the first draft of this was written in about two thousand one I think and was published actually was published in the summer of two thousand in Chain magazine in their memoir anti memoir issue which was edited by Gina Osman and Juliana Sparr. The version that appeared in that magazine was pretty short and so as we were preparing a copy for this one I inserted.  A lot of new material, but all the original material is in here as is without any change, but there's a lot more in it now. Okay, so it's called Notes Toward a Phenomenology of Time, and it starts with two epigrams. Of course, when you're seventy three, there are a lot of another times. Duke Snyder at Pee Wee Reece's funeral. Even if I say I have lived or I shall live, it's present because I'm saying it now.
