But you can't do that. He hasn't even finished his spinach, urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment. But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment succumbed to a strange new hush. Actually, it's quite pleasant here, thought the Sea Hag. If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don't mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over. She scratched one dug pensively. But Wimpey is such a country.  Bumpkin always burping like that. Minute at first, the thunder soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder, the color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched his balls. It sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country. This next poem must date from about nineteen seventy four, when I at last could no longer escape teaching and began teaching poetry to students at Brooklyn College, and found myself immediately assailed by their questions about what is poetry and why is this a poem?  Why do you say this isn't? And what is poetry anyway? And so this is called What Is Poetry, but the title has no question mark. And I don't think it was probably very helpful to the students, but it was part of my finally beginning to think about what is poetry myself, having done it for a long time without ever having asked myself that question. And it ends as so many of my poems do, or rather they include lines of bits of conversation overheard very often when walking on the streets in New York, where you hear rather peculiar things sometimes.  What is poetry? The medieval town with frieze of boy scouts from Nagoya. The snow that came when we wanted it to snow. Beautiful images. Trying to avoid ideas as in this poem. But we go back to them as to a wife leaving the mistress we desire. Now they will have to believe it as we believe it. In school all the thought got combed out. What was left was like a field. Shut your eyes and you can feel it for miles.  Now open them on a thin vertical path. It might give us what, some flowers soon? It's the last line. It might give us what, some flowers soon that I overheard a boy saying to a girl in Brentano's bookshop in New York and decided to keep it. The next one at North Farm was written in the early eighties and although North Farm obviously could be anywhere and I don't explain it.  in the poem what suggested it. It's actually the name given in the translation I read of the Kalevala, the Finnish folk epic of a place called I think it's Pohjola, I don't know how the Finnish pronunciation, a place described as being near hell but not exactly in it and always with the epithet gloomy and prosperous North Farm. At North Farm, somewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you at incredible speed, traveling day and night through blizzards and desert heat, across torrents, through narrow paths.  But will he know where to find you, recognize you when he sees you, give you the thing he has for you? Hardly anything grows here, yet the granaries are bursting with meal, the sacks of meal piled to the rafters, the streams run with sweetness, fattening fish, birds darken the sky. Is it enough that the dish of milk is set out at night, that we think of him sometimes, sometimes and always, with mixed feelings? Well, this is a fairly recent poem of the past few years.  I don't know exactly when. At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it. And I can't think of anything I was thinking about when I wrote it, so I won't introduce it except I see it has the phrase The Unruly Son, obviously, a theft from John Dunn. At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it. But then I thought keeping quiet about it might appear even ruder. At first I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  The unruly son informed me otherwise. I am in my heavy set pants and find this occupation of beekeeper charming, though I have yet to meet my first bee. We don't know if I get to keep the hat and veil. Too hot, he said, too hot for everything. He's so caring, so mundane. To have you on board. Bulgarian choirs everywhere stood up and sang the song of the rent. It was lovely. Now I shall take a short vacation, proof that I am needed here. Nobody wants my two cents anymore, I believe.  To some, it was like skating in summer. A small turret perched over the lake. It exploded. That's the way I feel about people taking me out to some nice repast. And afterwards, you go home and go over everything that was stated. I prefer flowers and breathing. The next poem is called No Longer Very Clear. Well, it's no longer very clear to me when I wrote it or what I was thinking about when I wrote it. However, I could tell you that the public radio station in New York City, WNYC.  had a benefit concert, and they asked me to contribute a poem which would be set to music by a number of contemporary composers, or at any rate they would write music suggested by it if they weren't actually setting the words. And Philip Glass, Morton Gould, Tanya Leon were among the composers. One of them was the composer Joan Tower, who is actually a friend of mine and colleague at Bard College, where she teaches. And she took two of the lines and wrote piano pieces.  She says are based on them and she's going to do another one to make three, but she hasn't done it yet.
