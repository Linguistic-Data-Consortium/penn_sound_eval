Where art thought this spelt upon the hand be of the handmaiden, ghosts which fathomed, blinked, and bothered no more? Thus she begins, worse soothsayer.  Say little said, little say sooth sawed, or meaning to rewrite perplexity, possibly sworn to such the further fathoms of fabric swung, so possibly sleep, so possibly supporting the dangers of small fish placed accordingly in our pockets, we set out. And nowhere beginning tapestries, early morning dedications, a salve, weather maps broken. The relaxing figure draws a window pane easily with deft blue finger. The glass trembles.  The interrupted moment returns, embeds itself in skin. Palimpsest. Put the rock crystal in the sun and put the warm crystal on your eyes if they are blurry. The rock crystal eliminates the malicious fluids of unshed tears. Its natural art originates from water. Lighten my eyes, pleads the psalmist.  I sleep. Interlude. I dress my vowels oddly, peaks covered with garments of birch. Simplicity is an even fitting, a diagram of snow to define white, not trembling linen maiden, no pleated coif inherited, but one deliberately unbound.  Even now? Gold from circlet. Interior from chamber. Speech requires an opaque mistress whose steps appear mineral. A winter song closeted by staves. Sentencing. There is more waiting than one thought possible, began the female sentence. But how then must one proceed? Simply, replied the pale.  One proceeds, one need not wait. Not wait? asked the sentence. All will befall, replied the pear, and none will be forsaken. One may lose, regardless of gazing lookingly. This episode of yours is hardly less meek, it will befall everyone. But when the sentence gazed into the pear and saw herself reflected in its golden skin, she knew otherwise. How, then, can my befallen state be the same as any other? When one has just heard brave news, replied the pear, that one has no idea.  has been granted a wish, the sentence must contrive to complete itself. Confound the one who first distinguished the hours, continued the sentence. Thus my body becomes a question. Who assembled the first sundial whose shadows plague these letters to no end? So the second part of this book is called Tales in Miniature and they are.  Tails constructed of three words. So you get to imagine the rest. Furrow, tigrish, till, woodcutters, pebble, prattle, banister, water, weight.  Letter. Falcon. Hidden. Purpled. Snarl. Lilt. And then the last section is an associative dictionary called Festoon Dictionary, which is not alphabetical. So the book moves from tales that are roughly about.  to the three word tails to then the tail within each word. So I'll read a few dictionary entries. Checkered. Careful in the observance of quickfire and ceremony. Superstition. The spine of a herring with ribs extended. Hoof. The quality of being strident. We struck the main road impetuously.  Plough, antidote to stiffening. Utter, unknown sound of certainty. Crimson, that portion of the floor of a room on which a fire stands. Barricade, to please to such a degree as to smother resistance. Spiracle, writing in the walls.  Ether, being such in name only. Canary, a gown like outer garment with forelimbs modified to wings. Seed, a group of letters representing a word. Glade, a temporary stillness. Moonwise, a long, slender, slender, downward curved bill. Sleep, to fasten.  Inaction. Star written in superscript, retinal rising. And then I'm going to read from probably my newest project, which is called Scorpion Odes. And I was investigating the natural and literary history of the scorpion, also as a metaphor for various cultural maladies at the moment.  Work in progress. So, starting with two quotations. From Shakespeare, some private scorpion do you pontificate? And from Shelley, a mind that broods over guilty woes is like a scorpion girt by fire. Scorpion Ode. I prayed the dictionary. I asked pardon.  of dream, I feared scorpions in their silence, and walked each morning into the rising mountain. I vowed not to become the nullifying silence, but to nullify the other paralysis being born, to speak with the elevated precision of silence, from the marrow of consciousness, the living aspect of which appears solid, but isn't complete until we have left the word, the mountain, and the scorpionic premises.  Departure. I speak from another vantage, though it is not mine. Nothing is anyone's, formally speaking. Even if you walk along this peculiarity of gasping ordination, a mime is more akin to the moment. If you could hold it and walk alongside me, I'd be somewhere, driven to the particle within miniature fluctuations of light, not visible light, but what turns you and pulls you from your bed on a morning is such you would rather not be bitten.  Wakeful refraction is the missing testimony of leaving. Where are you going and how will you get there? Scorpion Ode. I watched the reader read, and the squares upon calendars looked back upon me. I tried to read from the book, but even magnified, I could not see it. What scurried beneath the book, I cannot say. I hung upon the walls, not regret, but a ship below a bat.  Open.
