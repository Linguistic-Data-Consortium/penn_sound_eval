Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	0.0	633.12	 I think I'll close this first group with a form that's also in the ends of the earth. It's called Waite West in the Shadow, which is a line I take from Pam's forty seventh count of who even dead yet had his mind entire.  Wait less than the shadow. We encounter in the lateral Tamil with great depth. I wear in my forehead a Davy lamp, newly acquired. The gift, in fact, of a young lady casts an intense circle beyond whose rocky confines, blackness, nothing, your seamed face as in a developing fluid coagulates, the lips lift to tell me I have not yet solved the riddle of the universe.  But in the cage I carry, has died, you point out, misled. I'd gotten off the elevator at the wrong level. You shrug, but cast the dice on my behalf. Back, they indicate, to the pit head, collect nothing from the company store, except I sank these shafts. Your fierce outburst, at last, to hear that voice, an obscene gesture next, old man. Brown shapes of countenance on the skin, over the excited hands, sarcastic.  The right hand, forefinger extended, lightly taps your temple then, quickly down to the pocket still. And what do you come up with with a dollar bill? I'm to buy a ballpoint, ten and five blue examination booklets at the commissary. This is becoming ridiculous, a dream. Four of them to wrap my lunchtime apples in. The fifth turns into a bluebird for my cage. I'll write it out. You pull your plastic goggles down over your eyes and eyes.  See, just as you turn away myself indistinctly reflecting. The moon leaving the lift, your turn, aches blindingly, some small soft hand clasps mine, or a man's hand merely does she grasp, maintaining she'll lead me away from the pitfalls, her path takes me in a suspect tangent, dazzled still. My other senses would rescue me, my watch beats.  My heart's an army on the march of ragged and conflicting voices. Raised in sung, they argue in the singing. Is it not my comrades changing shifts, that late already? Globules of soil roll onto my stumbling progress, if that's the word. There she, you says, she laughs, dimly her face swims clear. There I bought your silly bird, but he wanted out, and so the grilled small gate hangs open. Next minute we hear how good a cook she is.  Next, you, old Maul, working right through lunch break, under our feet, knock. I mean, deep rooted trees vibrate about me. Not back, you said, simply. The tunnels are unending. How can I confront you, the cage of an absconded trapeze artist? Will you be angry? I won't descend. Will you shrug merely? I won't come again. She is leading me on to Dallien. She laughs. I won't budge, but the whistle.  The pit head shrills till everyone is in the evening elevator down. I've slept, dried spittle, but the whistle. The naked lady hears it as music. She has her gift of inattention, her hip bones flesh, the coal dust on her sheets, the mine I thought lay hidden, the fumes however render a whole district mine, her hard mattress, motionless, the stars.  Are insatiable holes, we argue, I hold them. Baby lamps. The stars are. The night is cold, I slurred the word, is cold, I said, and she heard the blonde kiss holding gold. Yes. Have there been women like this evening? She is.  Gloriously unlike more is the agony, by the peril of whose soulful presence I've felt compelled to pour my soul's perilous adventures out to, to say, or yearn to, desperately over and over, I love you, whatever misery ensue, is happiness, finding some vain ease in the mere saying, as any mother's son, as though there were no other way of love, inept to be wiser, to choose my silences, while we work life out together, taking care.  Carefully and lending so the seams don't break, or not yet, not today. Or a flash of syntax similar is unavailing, as once more for the first time ever comes to be, this night of all my life and all, or nothing, or and nothing, chance, voices conspiring against voices for these choices must be that utterly ambiguous, these metaphors for what hasn't yet its shape is also thought too late. I spoke, revealing choice to be illusory. Let's make it more than that.  Almost I hated her, who was breaking my heart open so that I say, Be my fate, and she refuses not to. She complies, being herself, as no one else can do. I read the final mission.  Whatever stood furthest up the trail was master off the trail, which for the most part climbs through a beautiful if crowded forest, though the final four or five hundred yards rise above the tree line, across tricky scree and end, at that peak, which is also the scarp edge, is steep and, despite the rumours, inaccessible, drop on one side, the shallow slope on the other, where the wood grows, that is mainly conifers. To be master meant to gather all those things, the ownership of which.  proves masterhood a tribute all other travellers are bound to pay. Two friends who thought to scorn such enchantments were walking through this wood one day side by side. They were talking an old story begun as they entered the shade wherein the trees addressed a pair of wanderers with promises of succour when first one friend then the other heard the branches whisper as if to himself alone and suddenly a most powerful odour overcame their senses and a woman naked broadheaded.  and sloping a shoulder, stepped out of the thicket and beckoned. Now both these men, in flight from a band of relatives who presently were pillaging their homesteads, hoped in the remotest hollow of the forest to find sanctuary in an abandoned mill of which they read. Yet the sight of this creature turned them, where they fell to arguing which of them first should address himself to her who stood expectantly by. They decided finally the softer spoken ship. He who had first heard the trees murmur, his companion making a joke.  of it, remarking, Your mother thought you were raised up with a due respect for womanhood. No sooner, however, was this agreed upon than he, this pleasant man, began to waver, wondering whether the other might not be better for the job, and even expressing doubt that he himself had any rights in this matter. Perhaps, he chuckled, I'm not really here at all. He was pushed forward, though, but when he approached the lady, she told him she might only yield herself.
