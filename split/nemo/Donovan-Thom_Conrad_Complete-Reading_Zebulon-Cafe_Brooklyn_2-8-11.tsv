The poem must preserve a place to remain in what is not real. The poem must be an active force in a universe that is heterogeneous, however real. So that was the whole. And now I'm going to read you some notes.  My collaboration with CA Conrad. And then we will read the poems that we wrote based on this somatic exercise called Arthur Echo. Somatic exercises are this wonderful form that Conrad has single handedly invented and extended through a blog that he keeps called The Somatic Exercises Poetry Blog, which if you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth reading and keeping up with.  Echo Arthur. While house sitting for friends in Philadelphia, we collaborated on the following somatic exercise, playing Arthur Russell's CV World of Echo on repeat on all five floors of the house. We moved from floor to floor from nine AM to nine PM, taking scheduled breaks for food, conversation, and checking in for further fine tuning of the somatic maneuvers. Basement. Windows covered. Pitch black.  A small boom box plays CD on repeat with bass controls set to maximum. A white candle to light when sitting down. Blow out when leaving. The sink beside the table to slowly drip water on one hand while taking notes with the other. First floor. CD on stereo with balanced equalizer settings. All shades open. A chair sits by the front door. Open mail slot to peer at passing feet on the sidewalk. Every other page of notes should be nouns only.  Nouns. Second floor. CD on small CD on small stereo. Volume low. Computer set to show videos of Arthur Russell and his cello. In bathroom the tub is filled with a mixture of water and jasmine flower infusion. Jasmine invokes the muses. Take notes sitting in a chair by the tub while feet soak in the jasmine infusion. Third floor. CD on large stereo. Volume high. Treble adjusted to maximum. Books on alchemy sit at the desk.  by the window. Take notes. Upper loft. CD on third floor stereo carries up to the loft. At the end of the bed, facing the window, which looks over the Philadelphia tree tops and skyline. There are tarot cards and binoculars on the bed to better see the world. Take many notes. Last winter, I had the pleasure of composing a somatic exercise with my friend CA Conrad. Our exercise was based on downtown New York City cellist Arthur Russell.  Russell's masterpiece, World of Echo. It is difficult to describe Russell's World of Echo for anyone who hasn't heard it before. It has a rare spiritual quality, which issues from Russell's songwriting, voice, and cello playing, but also from the production values of the album. Perhaps the following passage from Tim Lawrence's biography of Russell, Hold on to your dreams, makes palpable Russell's subtle, accidental studio processes. During these sessions it became standard for Arthur to splice together separate tapes, and he would regularly grab a track from one tape and fly it into the multitrack of another while his envelope.  looking engineer tried to stay calm. We would be mixing on a piece of tape and I would see the splice go by, recalls Eric Lestrand. It was all very confusing. I could never really tell what we were working on until it was done. The ghostly accidents that arose from Arthur's insistence that they rerecord over old tape became an integral part of the sonic fabric. At one point, Conrad told me that he used the album to heal a knee injury that he had suffered. Russell was trained foremost as a musician and only afterwards as a Buddhist.  The healing powers of this music I can only imagine come from the confluence of these two disciplines. For our exercise, Conrad and I decided to have Russell's album playing on four different stereos throughout a five story house for a twelve hour duration. twelve hours is a long time to do anything, and especially to listen to an album tripoli on repeat. Among the constraints I recall imposing upon myself, many had to do with memory, trying to forget the last line I had written before continuing, interrupting myself midline, then picking up with the line again. These exercises in attention and discussion.  Abstraction I felt were true to Russell's music, so was a certain circularity that the exercises were trying to induce amidst interruption and disjunction. We also spent much of the nine hours improvising lines with a set of books I brought with me from New York City to Philadelphia, many of which were of a wholly metaphysical or medical import. Among these books include the writings of Henry Corman and his acolyte Christian Janvet, Oliver Saxe's Seeing Voices, Maurice Merlot Pointy's Selected Writings of Phenomenology, a collection of Gaelic folk tales and ballads.  Helen Keller's autobiography, Robert Kociak's Rhubarb, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead. I also remember reading a number of recently published poetry books, including Jules Boykoff's Courageous Hegemonic Love Potion. Russell, perhaps more than any other composer I have come into contact with, understood the importance of tuning his body and his mind as instruments coeval with his cello and the other instruments, drum machines, guitar, tabla, he would use throughout his compositions. Via studio production, Russell gained access to the occult.  otherworldly in ways similar to Conrad's use of his own body as a source of information and vision explored through the somatic exercise. And to conclude, I'd like to read my contribution to this little book which Conrad has a few copies of. I would bug him immediately. And Conrad will read his contribution later. Arthur Echo means inhabitation.  Depends.
