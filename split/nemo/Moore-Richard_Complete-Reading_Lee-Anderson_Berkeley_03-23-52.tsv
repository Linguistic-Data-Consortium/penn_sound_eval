The deliberate spacing of the fence posts was as plain as the apparently undeliberate spacing of the clumped wild iris, the iris in the field that the fence kept the sheep from. But this was when the fence was new and is not what the fence is, bulged, where the sheep have leaned, not one of the posts straight, broken in places, the regular spaces in abstraction.  The rectangles are untrue, and through the holes the sheep have passed from one field into the next field, cropping the wild iris, and lessening the apparent distinction between field and field. It is dangerous to say, with the words rusting as the old wire fence red where the galvanizing has worn off, whether the fence has suffered a kind of death, or whether the fence stands, askew and broken, as a sign of separation.  the death of separation, the fence inseparable from that place between field and field. THE NIGHT SEE Under the rain the trees like crow feet scratch, tangling the spittle's sky. These are the elements that give my heart ease, and make its watch run regular as the rain, solemn as the crow, its claw grip into the wet returning wind. The blear watering face is washed and smeared  The ditch running ruinous page, One page for each year of my age, And each caw of the mind is the watery rage That my tears pay for my tongue's release. But never again for time telling heart ease, Or the song that fills the true shape of a pain, For the heart is struck by the frog spearing rain, And is washed away, Without feature, or the mere fire that dropped on its first birthday. Night flooding fog at the eaves of the year, All unwilling inward.  It quenches like fire, drenched in a hulk sea smothered and swallowed, towed under the wave, stowed safe home again from the wakening rain, that freshens green crests of the scudding hills, rakes the clean air, launches crows from the field. It is under the night sea, the uneasy grave of sleep I am sown, laced in a jacket of ills, bedded naked and wheeled down the shafts of the swallowing sea, to wake once more to the rap of the heart speaking rain, in the spittle dawn, aged in the old  birth of the first day, and I thirst again for my cold death that spoke me oblivion, paid my wage that my tongue should speak. It was deceit, deceit, wind riding like the hurly burly crow, shadow falling upon shadow in the field, the yield picked clean, not a grain but green caught before its spring. Damp rot in the husk reeks, no rainbow nor fathering of the swinking sun can raise what was laid down in the mothering mire, but picked clean  before, oh, an eternity before its first day's dawning. And the husk can rattle in the rambling wind, swim in the streaming seas among islands of crows, but it goes blind and mindless under the coffin nailing rain that sands the husked house thin, as the bony, starved crows clod to the fence. They have eaten the silence. The fig tree.  The leaves, large for so small a tree, moved one against the other in the deep green air, and the light, amid bays and inlets of the leaves, rippled, where the ripe figs hung, purple in that green pool, almost bursting in the cool water of the air. It was fearful to plunge, although all summer's ripeness hung there, in the deep pool it moved, rippling in the muscular light and shade, and it was fear in its multiple same figs.  The rank ripeness of the fig swelled of an abandon fearful to reach to. Heavy and filled, the burst figs fell at intervals in the afternoon, and I saw in your eyes, still in that pool of air, the livid bruise of the same indifferent fall. The hawk's cry from the tall sky fell.  But my hazel eye Against a blue and lidless eye Was set, my stare Went only into blue distance, wastes of air, Each augury of hell Invisible to my sense. There was an eagle, set On a moulding book in the attic Full of moth holes he was, Yet terrible in my childhood. I pulled his feathers, but they stuck, And dodge as I would, His blind glass look Spoiled my young luck. Wife and child brought new eyes to feathers.  flesh that had grown wild in the high wood of a green world.
