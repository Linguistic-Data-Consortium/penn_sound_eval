Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09	0.0	487.93	 I had a question about for Laura Smith about her talk, and it's a follow up question in relationship to what John Ratellik said about the some of the problems with rapture, rapture, or the troubling nature of using those two when you're looking and thinking about not just the relationship between bodies, the violence done to bodies, the history of bodies in relationship to one another, particularly since you were doing your piece on Akeelah Oliver, and since she's specifically invoking the issue of not just the issue of slavery, but the instruments of torture done to bodies through slavery.  Um, I don't know, you know, um, Sydia Hartman's scenes of subjection in which she talks about kind of, not just the kind of rupture in relationships of bodies, but the pleasure, right? I mean, that kind of, the dangerous forms of pleasure. And I'm wondering if you could speak to how, obviously you couldn't do that in a very short presentation, but how, because I know this is part of your work in a larger project, how does your work deal with when you put those things together in conversation? How does it deal with those, with the troubling dimensions while at the same time not abandoning your interest in exploring Oliver's work in this way?  I mean, I think that my answer to that and my response to the link between rupture and I'm sorry, rapture and its religious connotations are the same. And I think that this is what I'm so interested in in what I see as Oliver's repurposing of the idea of rapture. It's still embodied in her version. And I think it's secularized. And I see this I've been seeing this across such a lot of queer and trans work that I'm seeing these very radical trans bodily identifications.  that are very located, very raced, very gendered, very specific, very aware of boundaries while they transgress. And that's intensely paradoxical, but I think that and I do think that there's this crux about transcendence that that work is thinking about and thinking about something that feels very paradoxical between locatedness and relationality. But I do think that the metaphor of rapture gets local, it gets secular, and it gets involved.  Now, I wanted to notice something and maybe have some people comment on it. I was curious in my notes on Jones talk, which may not have been the segue in Jones talk, I have written down alterity within the self, and the next thing I have written down is reciprocal alterity. Now, having alterity within the self has been commented on by Natalie Randall. Body stuff full of mine suggests alterity by Trish, including in the last comment about Trish.  And then going towards transcendence to solve the problem of the alterity within the cell. And by Ronaldo, in a way, in one of the acquaintances, leathered fishnet. And so I was wondering how when you have alterity within the cell, which is patent and like being played out and commented on, one also can produce a reciprocal alterity with the other. Because it seems as if the players have multiplied. That is, if every cell has alterities of various kinds. And the ethical goal is reciprocal alternate reciprocal.  Cyclical alterity. There's been a morph into a polyvalent space. This is very, very interesting. And that's what I noticed in the terms of a relationship among a lot of the things that have been said. And I wondered whether, if anyone else noticed it, they would like to comment on it. That is the echo problem, the cyclical alterity when one is fissured in a variety of ways. Just a small mathematical question. Subject other, subject alterity within the space.  subject and subject other abject. And I think that, you know, with regards to the Labynasian question of, you know, the feminine and the other and that then becoming confounded with women and the question of whether women then occupy the masculine relation to the feminine, this sort of framing what is left out of that is actually and in between a sort of destroyed ground which might be the enemy, the Palestinian for Labynas. It might be it might be the unmarked, the unreclaimable body. And so for me, the ethical question has less to do with.  The constituent of misrecognition between our own alterity and others, which is an asymmetrical landscape, and we're negotiating, but the further violence of an unmarked terrain, which enables even flouting self other. So putting the third animal is really putting a third space, Patrician Quiddian, which is actually not a dialectic, but it's some other space.  With what's just been said, I think that the moment one recognizes alterity in one's self, one is recognizing the reciprocity of alterity. Alterity is not only about others outside of one's self, and I do think that the vectors of alterities go in many directions. That in itself is not a very full statement, but it leads to a question.  or raises questions of the nature of practices within a world scape where you can be mapping reciprocal alterities rather than mapping us then alterities. I have a question about that, Darren. I think on the one hand, it makes a lot of sense that that is how we get there. But I think I'd also like to say it's possible to recognize good things within yourself and not relate to still being.  to bring together and not monopolize. Not move in that way that we have the ideas of ethical relationships. So one can say, you know, I recognize this and that you and not you. You know, for sure. I wanted that to be done. No, I think it's, again, I think it's one of those necessary but not sufficient matters. But that you certainly can recognize otherness within yourself.  But in order to begin a dynamic of precipitation.
