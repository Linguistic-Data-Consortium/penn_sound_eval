She stares into her TV's two AM glares, watches the way she once watched a boy's body, too quick for caution and traffic signs, parse asphalt. Neighborhood boy, corner boy, man to be, been, bones, done and gone. What light is good on that? To want and not ask. In somniloquies.  Earthworms aren't maggots. Eating them ain't planting a tree or a flag. She wants to shout at her TV when some Sue gulps earthworms from a cup. She wants to shout at this idea that there's payback for what's done to come. Earthworms aren't decomposers nor distraction from street corner noise. You think a woman would know this, she thinks. This thought, a squirrel on a lawn.  thoughts of other women, more squirrels. Her mother, I'd hate you to miss sex, when she wanted to be a nun. Her mother, I'd like to hear this. What do you know about a man? When she wrote home about her lover, whose mother taught her to knit. When she wrote home about knitting, she was still girl incognizant, still the girl writing, We are the faces we wear, where, in flashback, still the girl with a face like a movie screen, who knits skull caps,  With yarn red as cartoon blood, as red as mammy tushoo shoes, matchstick heads, yarn red as cartoon lips, tongues, red as bandanas, and pomegranates. Red as blood, that says woman, may be mother, says watch and count. Red as blood butterflied across the seat and white of summer coolots. Red as red velvet cakes, she thawed and ate over two months mourning time. Red as red velvet curtains, she wanted to drape around this moment. Red as warning, as warning.  Bluster as bluff, as the flat of offering plates. Red as warning, as unheeded signal to stop, as sliced rare meat. Color that the temp that the temporarily colorblind first perceive. Red. Be utterly fly swims through corner voices. To be is to be. Color that disappears in early film. Black, boot black, blue black. Be utterly fly, be itch, be road, be ache.  Between want, have, reach. She wants a sleep that shutters her like the small cornobodagus. She wants a sleep against this neighborhood graffiti of noise. But need is the swarming of a sonorous and deep darkening hive. But need is the swarm that only a keeper can take tact against. What she know about silence? How it settles in a throat like swallow.  about become into mind at times she thinks she don't think. How her throat tightens like a branch on which cataclysmic swallows roost. How her throat tightens tracks through slow syllables memory's weather. Geometry of a park pool. A boy presses her twelve year old head, geometry of an air filled melon beneath water with deft hands she struggles against.  Someone she can't remember sees her thin arms as she struggles against those hands, that struggle breaking the water's skin, as if to make plain the difference between a thought and a need, as if to map the shifting climates between words and bare knuckles, as if to show her knowing wasn't needing, he says he was playing, as if to show her the winters between words and his budding fists, he laughs, his young voice filled already like a snow globe with the coming winters.  All her thoughts of water, echoes in each syllable. Yesterday swarms in the marrow of your our thoughts as she lies there here sleepless, yesterday swarms in. To eat or not to, then what? She clears her throat. You can't be eaten from everybody, her aunt warned after the first loss. You can't be eaten like you don't mind trading a baby for red beans. That yarn's redness bleeds Persephone.  Jemima Renee, more squirrels. That yarn's redness, eating from a strange pot, tree, hand, mind, draws blood or sleep. Post troubles. Jemima was a daughter of Job's winter. Post troubles. Nancy Greene plays pleasant auntie before a car kills her. How'd Job's Jemima become a handkerchief headed pancake mix pimp? How'd Job's Jemima become auntie?  Jemima's your mama, she thinks, laughs. It was too late to think about being. No good sleep and such thoughts. It was too late to had become a kind of comfort. Let such stillness keep. The dark husk.
