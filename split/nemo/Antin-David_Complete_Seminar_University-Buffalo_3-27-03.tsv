I mean, I, you know, but they don't talk about that. You know, they say that the food nearly didn't reach the troops, let alone the humanitarian aid. The food nearly didn't reach them for the next two days. So what you have is all these supplies have to go into, you know, high tech wars require freight. But you could have, I mean, I could have run a news program in here in twenty minutes. I could have produced an absolutely clear, articulate example of what we knew and what we didn't know very clearly. And I said, now go to sleep, people, and wait for something to happen.  You know, it would be the end of the program. And not enough, it wouldn't be enough advertisement really. I mean, but when I left it on more than fifteen minutes, I had to turn it up because I heard this, they were recycling the same bullshit. Now, that's not a glut of information. It's a glut of pseudo information mixed with information. Information, but information is a novelty. It introduces a novelty into the structure, the unexpected. And the unexpected, of course, was the guerrilla war, which opened up on our flank. Although in classical warfare text, they always say, worry about that if you're going to have it.  of a long, single long line. These guys didn't worry about it. In fact, they're afraid to say that it might have been a misjudgment. I notice when the newscasters talk, they say, well, some people might say that it was a misjudgment of the military, but we're not sure. I mean, that's literally what they said. I mean, there's no textbook in military operations that doesn't refer to the dangers of exposing a long flank. I mean, it's ancient military lore. The Chinese knew it, the ancient Chinese knew it, the Indians who played Shatranji knew it. Don't let yourself get exposed on a flank, you can be cut off.  So, I don't know. I mean, in that sense, I think that it takes a good deal of precision and careful thinking to be able to get somewhere. And what I do is think, have mind, will travel. I'll think as well as I can, and I take pleasure in thinking. I take pleasure in trying to figure out what's happening to myself, to the world, and I think that's part of the pleasure of poetry. It's the pleasure of thinking and not locking yourself in. It's not the pleasure of reading an Anthony Hector.  I don't have any terrifying feelings that are terrible, but if you want to write Robert Browning dramatic monologues and update them slightly, that's what you're going to get. It's okay. It has certain dramatic, cynical character that you could say there's a little frisson that it produces at the end usually or somewhere in the middle of it. Great, all right. It's okay. I mean, it doesn't bother me, but I'm interested in that. That's not an artwork from my point of view, or if it is, it's a sort of subsidiary artwork. The School of Iowa produces something like a Diet Coke.  Well, it's a very modestly pleasant drink, you know, that makes your teeth grate because of all the goddamn saccharin. I think we should take a brief break now. Diet coke break, except I'm gonna go back and let's say something like ten minutes. Okay, five minutes after two. For about an hour. Am I answering the questions or am I too aggressive?  Everybody is not quite back. No, no. Well, people will come back eventually. What was the line in the nursery rhyme? Leave them alone and they will come home whacking their tails behind them. Can I catch you? It's nice. It has to look as minimal art. I know it's nice. There's a bunch of material I'm just trying to unload. I'm moving out of town and I just, you're welcome to make a contribution.  I don't know. All right. Would you like me to go? Go ahead. I'm gonna stop now. I do some hyper management. Okay. I was thinking about something you said a little earlier, that information is novelty. And I was thinking of, and something I was talking about was how the how you're talking. The thing I think of is fugue. How you bring up a theme and you develop the theme and then later the themes, maybe they change a little bit or maybe you move them. And I was thinking if you could talk like.  One, kind of how you manage that as you work and what goes on through your head as you do that. Do you think of it in terms of managing themes? I don't now. When I was writing in a more procedural poetry, I actually, in the book called Definitions, the poem called Definitions for Mending was constructed to be a fugue. And it was constructed specifically on the structure, it was built entirely on the structure of a fugue. There's a set of themes.  that come up, one of which was this whole thing called where I took a definition from an insurance book. As I said, my lack of understanding was always one of the things that got to me. And I had been trying to address the loss of a dear friend who died very young, and this is many years later, because I tried it once before and I hadn't been able to do it. And I was living in a corner of the Bronx near the Whitestone Bridge, which had a good library. It mostly was filled with Catholic philosophical texts, which was rather nice because they had the journals of Simone Vale.  I found an insurance manual. I figured they would know what value is. And what loss was. At least they would know what loss was. They might not know what value was. So I found the phrase, I went to him and I found in the insurance book, this loss is an unintentional decline in or disappearance of a value arising from a contingency. And I figured that's fine, but I don't know what a value is. So I went to the dictionary and I found out what a value was. And that comes from the particular dictionary I was looking at. So then I specifically started meditating on them, you know, in a way that you would by playing them.  The themes in relation to each other. You know, the term fugue is a metaphor, but there was something like my interest in what they call the Stretto, that is the bringing together, tightening of the distances between narrowing the distances between the materials between one theme and another. You narrow the harmonic distance and play them closer and closer.
