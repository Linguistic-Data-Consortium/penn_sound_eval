What word are you looking for? In a mimeographed lesson of doctor Quimby on the subconscious, I find he also calls it the book, and he said, We are not any wiser than the book we have written, where the bees came in, came to mind from their place or time into this place misplaced, when I remembered not where the book was, but their song in the sun.  On june eighth, nineteen sixty one, news came that HD had had a stroke. In July, Norman Holmes Pearson wrote, The part of the brain which controls speech has been injured, so that she cannot recall appropriate words at will, yet she does have fiercely the desire to communicate and strikes her breast in passionate frustration when there is no word at her tongue's tip. Sometimes whole sentences will come, sometimes everything but the key word. So it is I want, but one can never tell what it is she wants.  Doves. Mother of mouthings. The gray doves in your many branches code and decode what warnings we can recall of love's watery tones. She raises the bedroom window to let in the air and pearl gray light of morning, where the first world stripped of its names extends, where initial things go, beckoning dove sounds recur, taking what we know of them. And the soul leaps to the tongue's tip, as if to tell.  Secret in the word for it. The bird's claw scraping the ledges. I hear the rustling of wings. Is it evening? The wood winds chortling or piping. Sounds settling down in the dark pit where the orchestra lights glow, as the curtain rises, and in the living room, at another stage, lamps are lit. The lady in the shade of the boughs held a dove in her two hands, let it fly up from the bowl she made, as if a word had left her lips. Now that the song has flown, the tree shakes.  Rustling in the wind, with no stars of its own, for all the nets of words are gone. The lady holds nothing in her two hands, cut, the catches of the years are torn, and the wood light floods and overflows the bowl she holds, like a question. Voices of children from playgrounds come, sounding on the wind without names. We cannot tell who they are there. We were once, too, under what star, before words, after words. Hands lifted as a bowl for water, alms, or prayer, for what we heard was no more than a dove.  Hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  Oh, fateful thread. Sentences through my song most moved. Now from your courses the flame had fled, making but words of what I love. I'm going to read now with a breath. Poem I'm at work on, so it will not be in any way, this poem is intended as a sequence of like.  I've been more and I went through a period in which I reacted against the cantos because it seemed to me that pounds is always after all we had no other poems but the cantos since pound began on the cantos. Many different fascinations with the cantos. They've always been central. I began with the cantos at about the age of eighteen or nineteen and all my life have had many different ideas of them. Now recently I've been haunted by them again and they seem to me this time to open up a great freedom. That is a freedom in relation to the way in which I compose things thematically all the way through and I thought if I would open up let's say call something just passages as you might call something just fragments try to prevent it from forming into it.  poem as the Pindar poem or apprehensions formed into a total, a symphonic. The symphonic form or the sonata form fascinated me. I like to orchestrate a large poem. I like to have related movements and boxes, poems within poems, and now I wanted to see if I could let that loose. Now of course, I can't do it immediately. You'll find thematic progressions in this, but I have begun this poem in order to see if I can open up and eventually have some of these passages much more free of it. There is a kind of poem that I have never in my life been able to do and that really fascinates me.  The Williams is Spring and all. Now you see the later Williams is very much what I do do. All the later Williams is thematically composed and has a regular musical progression. But in Spring and all, there is a sequence of, I don't know, what is it, something like thirty two poems. It's much more than you could ever compose except by your intuition. So that's what I'm sort of going toward, and yet certainly at the beginning of this poem, you won't find it opening yet. I'm going to read as far as I have typed, and because this will be the first time I've read these in public.  First time, by the way, I've read that HD poem in public, and since the previous time, I was certainly not ready for it. I wasn't quite ready this time. I can't get it's one of the few poems that I can't get my distance from. And for me, the poem is a distance, not a feeling. But my feeling is so mixed up with the feeling of the poem, is the way I put it. I know the distance is there in the poem.
