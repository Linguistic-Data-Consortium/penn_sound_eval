Collected garbage gives off a distinct smell on the street, stinking of shoes and of myself, of mice, of neon sweat, of chairs and of myself, of useless news and of myself, stinking under the moon, my nose stuffy from carbonic gas, the nose of the bus engine, stinking of the same shirts.

San Paulo more European than San Paulo. Brazil more bureaucratic than Geneva. Hero more alluring.  Then boca. So, they've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil. In Brazil, the cuckoo sinks, go go. Macaw, macaw, macaw. Brazil is private property of no man's god and no woman's ferry. The patron saint of Brazil is its dreams, just as it's its devil. Brazil is a caryoca, not a polka. Caryoca, polka. Caryoca, polka, polka. Brazil is Carmen Miranda's two d fruity hats, Cayetano Velosa's all weather tropical.  Babel Gilberto's number on the charts. Brazil is the Elyse Antone Waters of March International Airport in this park. Brazil is Capirina with Fejuada, Capira with Fedora. Brazil is home of, I don't know, the Cassava or Tapioca.
