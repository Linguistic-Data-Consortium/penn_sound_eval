But it's yours, R said. It was mine, the woman said, but now I'm finished with it. I came here today to give it to you. seven. Twelve years ago, my wife's sister went off to live in Taiwan. Her intention was to study Chinese, which she now speaks with breathtaking fluency, and to support herself by giving English lessons to native Chinese speakers in Taipei. That was approximately one year before I met my wife, who was then a graduate student.  Columbia University. One day, my future sister in law was talking to an American friend, a young woman who had also gone to Taipei to study Chinese. The conversation came around to the subject of their families back home, which in turn led to the following exchange. I have a sister who lives in New York, my future sister in law said. So do I, her friend answered. My sister lives on the Upper West Side. So does mine. My sister lives on West one hundred ninth Street. Believe it or not, so does mine. My sister lives at three hundred nine West one hundred ninth Street.  So does mine. My sister lives on the second floor of three hundred and nine West one hundred and ninth Street. The friend took a deep breath and said, I know this sounds crazy, but so does mine. It is scarcely possible for two cities to be farther apart than Taipei and New York. They are at opposite ends of the earth, separated by a distance of more than ten thousand miles. And when it is day in one, it is night in the other. As the two young women in Taipei marveled over the astounding connection they had just uncovered, they realized that their two sisters were probably asleep at that moment on the same floor of the same building.  in northern Manhattan, each one was sleeping in her own apartment, unaware of the conversation that was taking place about them on the other side of the world. Although they were neighbors, it turned out that the two sisters in New York did not know each other. When they finally met, two years later, neither one of them was living in that building anymore. Siri and I were married then. One evening, on our way to an appointment somewhere, we happened to stop in at a bookstore on Broadway to browse for a few minutes. We must have wandered into different aisles. And because I and because Siri wanted to show me something, or because I wanted to show her something.  I can't remember. One of us spoke the other's name out loud. A second later, a woman came rushing up to us. You're Paul Oster and Siri Hustved, aren't you? she said. Yes, we said, that's exactly who we are. How did you know that? The woman then explained that her sister and Siri's sister had been students together in Taiwan. The circle had been closed at last. Since that evening in the bookstore ten years ago, this woman has been one of our best and most loyal friends. eight. Three summers ago, a letter turned up in my mailbox. It came in a white oblong.  envelope and was addressed to someone whose name was unfamiliar to me. Robert M. Morgan, of Seattle, Washington. Various post office markings were stamped across the front. Not deliverable. Unable to forward. Return to writer. mister Morgan's name had been crossed out with a pen, and beside it someone had written, Not at this address. Drawn in the same blue ink, an arrow pointed to the upper left hand corner of the envelope, accompanied by the words, Return to sender. Assuming that the post office had made a mistake, I checked the upper left hand corner to see who the sender was. There, to my absolute bewilderment.  I discovered my own name and my own address. Not only that, but this information was printed on a custom made address label, one of those labels you can order in packs of two hundred from advertisements on matchbook covers. The spelling of my name was correct. The address was my address, and yet the fact was, and still is, that I have never owned or ordered a set of printed address labels in my life. Inside, there was a single space typewritten letter that began Dear Robert, in response to your letter dated july fifteenth, nineteen eighty nine, I can only say that, like other authors, I often received a letter.  receive letters concerning my work. Then, in a bombastic, pretentious style, riddled with quotations from French philosophers, and oozing with a tone of conceit and self satisfaction, the letter writer went on to praise Robert for the ideas he had developed about one of my books in a college course on the contemporary novel. It was a contemptible letter, the kind of letter I would never dream of writing to anyone, and yet it was signed with my name. The handwriting did not resemble mine, but that was small comfort. Someone was out there trying to impersonate me, and as far as I know, he still is.  One friend suggested that this was an example of mail art. Knowing that the letter could not be delivered to Robert Morgan, since there was no such person, the author of the letter was actually addressing his remarks to me. But that would imply an unwarranted faith in the US Postal Service. And I doubt that someone who would go to the trouble of ordering address labels in my name and then sitting down to write such an arrogant, high flown letter would leave anything to chance. Or would he? Perhaps the smart aleks of this world believe that everything will always go their way. I have scant hope of ever getting to the bottom of this little mystery.  did a good job of covering his tracks, and he has not been heard from since. What puzzles me about my own behavior is that I have not thrown away the letter, even though it continues to give me chills every time I look at it.
