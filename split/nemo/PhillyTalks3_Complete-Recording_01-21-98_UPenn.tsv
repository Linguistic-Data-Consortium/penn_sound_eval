They're disgusted by their economic situation. They're disgusted by in Canada how, following the fifth term of Reagan administration, America Canada has to mock the same thing and how arts funding is being stripped away and essentially a gospel of facts from the right has been initiated that a debt, a national debt cannot be challenged in any way that the gospel of we can't spend because there's a debt. We have to somehow get rid of this debt before there can be any social.  Any social services left again. So I was interested in it for its ability to make some sort of challenge and rupture, and also because it articulates this movement towards pointing at and registering disgust and anger with these social facts. Having said that, I think that it's also a contingent poetics. I don't think a poetics of disgust, if it gets taken seriously, if it gets picked up by and discussed by anyone, and I hope it does because having spent the time editing the issue, I think it's a really interesting collection of people.  I think it's a contingent poetics, which is something that I see emerging across many different communities, where the kind of larger plans that lead to larger works are being shunted aside in order to have a contingent poetics that's based on a more momentary set of social relations. And then we could again invoke the homology of social relations in the text there, where if social relations have spit up, then one's poetics aren't going to be locked in. How are you going to address a rapidly transforming social sphere with a static poetics? So I see this as a move.  from desire to discuss, but also from a more stable long term plan, which Michel Deserteaux would register as a strategy towards a shorter term tactic of the contingent. I feel it's a bit of a presidential debate sort of here. It's quite interesting. I'm just waiting for the commemorative coins actually. Very, very nice. Oh, it looks so great painted on plates. Yeah. I mean, it sounds.  This is going to be crude because I haven't read the issue. And of the people you mentioned in that issue, I think I know some of the work of all but one of them, but had never thought of them in terms of a collectivity, which is, I think, actually one of the constant sort of underwriting issues that goes on for poets of my generation looking at poets of your generation. Steve Evans today in this poetics email discussion list told me to change my song.  And I responded that I will when it's warranted. It sounds to me from the description as though, having reinvented a Brechtian poetics, there would then be a positing, and I'm not sure exactly where, sort of the inverse, an identified arto, and I don't know who that gets to be, whether that gets to be people of my generation generally or a specific phenomenon.  And it feels to me, in that sense, invariably problematic, because of course, I'm one of these people who tends to think that you want Brecht and Arto sort of constantly talking to one another at the same time. Well, listening. And it seems in that sense to me problematic. It also seems problematic to actually think of the tactical as an advance. And some of what you say in your piece, especially towards Brecht.  at the beginning of that one letter about historical inhibition. I mean, this is a question I think that goes on in society in a variety of different fashions. It shows up again as the five terms of Ronald Reagan in the sense that the fall of Eastern Europe is like this very odd phenomenon. No leftist I knew in the United States, with the exception of about ten.  real sort of retro nostalgic CPers ever imagined that the Soviet Union, the good old Soviet Union, was anything other than this massive deformation of socialist discourse, which also had the funds to subsidize enough people in any given country to screw up their.
