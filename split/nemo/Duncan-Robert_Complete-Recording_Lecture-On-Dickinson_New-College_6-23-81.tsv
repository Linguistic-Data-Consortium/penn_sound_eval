It's one of the places where you began to get furious because you realize something being laid on you because it's not coming from this. But so her gnomic will mean I know more than you do you little twerp and and the ruin will be I mean and and gnomic in Emily Dickinson does not mean she knows something. It means something knows that language knows something she's not gonna I mean this is the way I don't she knows she knows plenty but that's not what we encounter this so strange nor what she encounters. She'll go into speaking.  from something she knows, but to bring us clearly to the place where we are at the rune and rune is to evoke runic. Gnomic is some utterance that is very close to enigma as different from symbol enigma is something that cannot be transferred into metaphor. So while I'm talking about the metaphor here in good degree when I go through these themes that are constantly operating in metaphor, one of the things that draws her to him is that she also experiences them as enigmatic. They rearrive and refuse, as I said. So we're in the presence of a metaphor that.  can't be located that we begin to realize is metaphorical because it has no location. And meanwhile, there is an absolutely annoying necessity for a location somewhere. So place has a lot is very telling her. The sea, for instance, and over beyond there and horizon and beyond horizon are not global as they are in Whitman. Although she's got experience. I think in the early poem, she has several references to Columbus and circling the globe as such.  is there in her mind, but not when she's going over there, not when she's going to another land or another place. Well, this one little poem is not only what I wanted to speak about in the way of her striking. The gnomic and the rune both go by being very striking, and she begins to have a language which is like Spencer's. Absolutely. She has a tense that looks subjunctive. We will find that, and then she also will strike out on her own for the serpent's figure glid stealthily along.  No accident at all. We've got, I think, two versions of this. There it is. Featured terms are themselves terms standing, not symbols, standing for something that comes immediately into question, and openly into question. What does that mean? Now Rune is the one that evokes this. Rune evokes where Gnomic covers in some way or is like a husk of something that you can't get at. Rune is to call up the thing as visitation, to call up the encounter.  with the thing. And that is very frequent mode. These are the modes in Emily Dickinson. You find prayer, certainly, in the terror and all her life, she inhabited a realm in poetry that needs prayer. So we'll find prayer. And an absolute certainty that that's where she is mystic, a certainty that she's got to dwell there. But this one little poem is just an extraordinary moment, and there are several of this kind. Following that one in number ten is just.  My wheel is in the dark, I cannot see a spoke, yet know its dripping feet go round and round. My foot is on the tide, an unfrequented road, yet have all roads a clearing at the end. One has resigned the loom. Some have resigned the loom, some in the busy tomb find quaint employ. Some with new stately feet pass royal through the gate, flinging the problem back at you and I. That's again, this at you and I, this I is striking enough when you look at the titles of her poems.  And so she's the other end of, if real life, think how near she is to Debbie who didn't want the eye there. So the eye must be remembered all the time. And it must be remembered all the time at the cost of saying at you and I. Now she, back to her letter to Higginson, I didn't go to, she went to schools all right, but in the sense you mean. I mean, in the sense no matter what school she went to, the poem so invades every level that she is not making mistake when at you and I because eye is the name of a person.  This is what Miss Susan observed. So me is more likely to be the one you heard that other people that I never belonged to you. Now only by visitation does I have we got a car again parked around. Okay. Oh, sorry. And this is everybody has faces right. They don't dream that she's not. I mean, she doesn't leave you room to think, oh, she's made a slip. Or, for instance, did she do it for Ryan there? I can't take a look at where that was number ten, was it? Yes.  No, no way. No way. Absolutely. Just I. Exclamation point. In case you missed the you and I. Well, actually, she might be rhyming it with employee. But me would have been an absolute rhyme for employee. And I is a very jarring one indeed. She likes jarring rhymes, but me would have been a I mean, not me would have been very typical of her employee and me. No, it's I is a name of somebody because me is a name of somebody too for her. Now, so her shifters are real persons within the poetry.  What I would get at, and I don't mean that she thought a heavy trip around, but she must have recognized what she was doing at you and I.
