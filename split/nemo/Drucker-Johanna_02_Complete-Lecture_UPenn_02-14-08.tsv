They've mapped these fears of seduction and pleasure onto the television, the game boy, the virtual world with its constant gratifications. I mean, it's not that there aren't issues with these things, but there's a kind of sense that, oh, you know, we'll put distance in there. And there's a kind of moral superiority in this critique that supposes that, you know, we should be didactic. You know, we should teach people how to not have pleasure with mass culture. Why? You know, that doesn't get at the systemic issues. It doesn't get at what is a problem here. And it takes for granted the idea that.  And somehow, as intellectuals, they're outside the culture. They're superior to it. Art, for them, is outside the ideologies. Resistance is our job. We are the moral conscience of the culture. And if you challenge this, as I have done on many occasions, and I have something I want to put forward, replace resistance. Resistance, said a critic recently to me when I gave a talk in New York, resistance will die hard. And he narrowed his eyes as he said it, and he hunched up his shoulders in a kind of defensive way. And they were very well fed and very well padded shoulders in a butter soft lamb leather coat. And I thought, yes, resistance will die hard.  especially among those with career investments in its stock. So as I was writing this piece, along came a press release from Joy Garnett. And it came through the email, and it had in it this brand new painting that she sent. And I thought it was so wet, it even looked wet on the screen. It was like, you know, just sort of wonderful. And the press release said, Joy Garnett continues her exploration of the malleability of instantly globalized images. She says she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates. And I thought, yes, this is so interesting. And she's like doing some, you know, remediation project and just working with them.  And it felt so much to me like the images in my book of real things, of things and persons observed, of photographs. And they're so striking that they sort of stop your day. And I could tell she was having that same experience, that these things just come at her and it stops her and she thinks, What an amazing image. But to really understand the image, she has to remake it. She has to repaint it. So again, I know that experience. I sit down. I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again. So why is that? What is that doing? What is Joy doing? She absorbs, I absorb, we process, we remake these things.  Experience the images anew. So they're outside me. This is not outside her. They're grafted, they're scraped from that surface. You know, you really kind of, through that physical act of making, you interpret something and you somaticize it, it becomes part of you. And it's a kind of seeing through the hand and seeing through the body that goes on. So where does Joy Garnett get her idea of what she's doing? I mean, what does she think she's doing? What is her idea of making art? What is it to make, you know, poetry and text into a book? What does it mean to create aesthetic expressions? Am I really doing anything different, anything more self conscious than I was when I was sitting there digging?  to China to know anything more about making art than I do about making about digging a hole. I'm not really sure. I think cultural mythology invents itself in us anew over and over again in each generation. But let's make a comparison here. Let's compare Joy Garnett with Damien Hearst, right? I mean, what makes art different from other made things? How do we know we're looking at art and not just at something else? You know, here's the consumerist issue. It comes right to the fore here. You know, this is the high stakes gamble. This is high priced art. This is kitsch vulgar imagery. You know, this is the investment in branding for the.  Love of God, right? What God, Mammon? Is this an outrage? Or is it actually the work that demonstrates the importance of the relationship between capital and art in order to keep its status? I think this is an important and serious work. And I think it tells us a lot. I don't think you can bracket it out, quite the contrary. This is the highest, most highly prized work by a contemporary artist, even if he's the person who bought it from himself in part. The point is that it tells us something. It tells us he could. There's something very, very important about this in terms of how art as a concept is constructing itself culturally. How about Marikalmy? Another art, I love this guy.  Or is he just a product designer? Is this art or product? This is crazed imagery, deviant, but it finds its market in all kinds of products. Is this an outrage? Is this art? Is this commerce? Or is it the demonstration of the importance of marketing and promotion in the production of not just art, but the category of art? Okay, what is art that we're doing it? Or Phil Collins, this is, you know, from the video installation, the world won't listen. It's a wonderful installation. Seductive. It's beautiful. You know, Phil Collins is a Smith fan. He set up this project to go to three cities.  Istanbul and Jakarta. And he gathered fans of the Smiths, all ages, in those cities. He set up karaoke performances and he filmed them. And then he installed them in this beautiful video installation where you see the three cities simultaneously side by side going through the cuts on the Smiths album. And what do they show you, these wonderful figures? They show impossibilities, the impossibility of ever becoming what you aspire to.
