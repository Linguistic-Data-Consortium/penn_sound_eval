I hadn't written for a long time, and I had wrote a thing, a text, words on a page, and I thought it was appalling, sort of dead and uninteresting, and I was sort of insulted by all this reference to nature, which doesn't seem to be very appropriate anymore.  self lacerating space that I live in. But I was desperate to get something new, because one gets very tired of one's work. So I needed something new. So I did something which was I'm interested in, as I said today in Charles' class, I'm interested in the idea of language as a set of examples, and that its best way of proceeding is by.  coming up with one example or another. And I guess I think of the example as something that is both possibly typical or common in common and something that's also equally an exception. So one of the places, of course, one of the very best places to find an example is in the dictionary because it's full of all these definitions that you didn't know that. So what I did was I have this wonderful little concise OEM.  that I've had for at least twenty five years. And you know how what the dictionary I'm really giving you my secrets here. You understand this. You know how you'll have a word and then it will just show you the way it's used but they won't say the word again because it would take up too much room. So they just give you the example of its use. So what I did was in the process I took this narrative thing that I'd written and I started breaking it up and what I did was that there was there would be a word and what I would do is find these examples and sometimes keep the word and sometimes erase the word.  Everyone's leaving. Is this sort of tiresome? Bye. What can we do? You don't know anything to strangers. Well, we could always lock the doors. Freight edges. Domain at hitherto causation listening booth page will show you who is right has stood the test. Domain at hitherto causation listening booth.  Page will show you who is right, has stood the test. Anecdotal soul, la carte, lay the blame on, bear the blame. Too late, na na, new neighbors have arrived in their slender. That's another pair, that's another pair, that's another, maybe am I gonna read this poem on? Domain and hitherto causation listening booth page will show you who is right, has stood the test. Anecdotal soul, la carte, lay the blame on, bear the blame. Too late, na na, new neighbors have arrived in their slender. That's another pair of shoes, dead men's shoes.  They have descended the ladder to the philosopher's hole, his spider and butterfly and bird. Here find the linear broken below a human form, hard shell of certainty, parody and reverence braided together, tiny beats of the heart, traced back to that other plan eternally existing, the young doing such a thing, the big what's the big cabinet of curiosities, what you may be looking at, unexplained. Now I am newly sad, although my house is fine, a silver pencil, a distinction, a thing for him.  In the gap between sadnesses, a man is talking, and I will come, it is probably a shame, and you are a pattern of tact, come to deceive us, but I, I cannot the infinite, as a child, no harm, but I'll try aloud, not guessing, I would have telephoned thirty miles much, well, highly, over what I have said, so thought abraids first proof. This opinion flatters no previous flourishing, no surefire procedure, as when three into six gets two, five into five gets one.  Interim is here in the cold foxglove, foxglove. Against whose mercy shall I apply my wares? Clarity pins us to our cause as we walk down aisles of flame proof trees. I am pointing at what is not there. You are standing as close as a child. Let us show the cat a film of crows. Explain one of the limbs or organs by which the flight of a bird, bat, insect, angel is effected part in, corresponding to, supporting part.  and comes on the wind, takes under, his are sprouting, high, low, and the north was added to the beat which spread, and the arrow with eagle feathers, the shaft and ambition, his spirit, the steps, the horse, the god, and victory, its way to its mate, the air.
