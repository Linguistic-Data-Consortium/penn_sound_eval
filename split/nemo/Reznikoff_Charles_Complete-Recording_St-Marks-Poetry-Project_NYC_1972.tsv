A young man wearing a loose jacket of light brown, with a yellow muffler tied loosely about his throat, is singing loudly to himself a Spanish song. In my country, he says in English, sing all the time. Money, sing, no money, sing. Then he adds staccato, as beginners in a language do. Donuts, five cents, four cents, no donuts. Coffee, five cents, four cents.  No coffee, restaurant, come in, please, and he bows deeply. No money, and he draws back, hands lifted, the indignation of owner and waiter on his face. Girl, he takes off the hat he does not have, and looks earnestly into the eyes of a girl that isn't there, then smiles and looks aside coyly. No money, and he turns away in disgust. Ah, tragic, tragic, tragic.  I continue to sit here, if I may. Instead of continuing to read about people, I wonder if I can read about a dog. This is somewhat longer. The highway I was walking on went through a marsh. There were no houses, nothing but the marsh.  No one else was walking on the highway in the blazing sun. I saw the dog a hundred feet away, a burly fellow, half chow, I thought, half German shepherd, shaggy hair plastered with mud. The dog saw me too, and came running towards me. I walked on, afraid the dog would bite. I could hear the nails of his paws clicking on the pavement, but he passed me, never looked at me, and ran along as I walked, ten or twenty feet ahead, ten or twenty feet behind. I did not like his looks at all.  The heavy brow, the square jaws, a shaggy, dirty fellow. The road was as lonely as ever, marsh under the blazing sky, and the motor cars went speeding past. I could see the pavement of the street on the other side, and the bright blue sea. It would be cooler there, and I might be rid of the dog. The dog looked up after a while, saw me on the other side, and came towards me straight through the traffic. I stood stock still, waiting for the dog to be hit. Sure enough, the second or third car struck.  and sent him sprawling on his back, squealing. The brakes of the car screeched. The dog leaped to his feet, was knocked down again, and then came running towards me. You dope, I said. But I was touched at his devotion. Now we went on side by side, the door close to me, and I no longer afraid. Now and then we came to a stairway leading to the beach. Below other dogs were running about on the sand, and the dog was eager to go down. But he stopped, waiting for me at the head of each stairway.  The street turned at last, and we were back on the highway. Now I was afraid to cross, for fear the dog would be hit. He stood beside me, looking up at me, watching my hands and feet, ready to spring forward. At last there was a break in the traffic, only two cars coming. I could cross easily, go part of the way, let the cars pass, and then cross over. But I was afraid the dog would rush on and be hit. No, I said, oh no. And we walked along the edge of the highway without crossing. As the dog ran on beside me, sturdy and true, I thought it was.  Lifted face, the deep brown eyes watching mine. Yes, I should like to keep him, walking so together. We came to some houses. These were at the sea, cottages, refreshment stands, even a small merry go round. I stopped at a stand. What should I get my dog to eat? I asked the pleasant girl behind the counter. She smiled at me and leaned over the counter to smile at the dog as he stood beside me wagging his tail. Hamburger, she said. Dogs love it. All right. One or two, two. She took the fresh dog.  Cakes out of the ice box and put them on a square of wax paper. I walked to the corner of the stand. The dog followed and I put the meat down. The dog looked at it, his tail drooped, his eyes were glazed with fear, and he was off as fast as he could go, bolting over the sandfills.  I think as you heard the young lady read some things I call testimony. Now the first two I did with this name were in this by the waters of Manhattan. Now they are based the testimony are all based on cases in the law reports. And this is the first there that I used of the two. The company had advertised for men to unload a steamer across the river. It was six o'clock in the morning, snowing and still dark.  There was a crowd looking for work on the dock and all the while men hurried to the dock. The man at the wheel kept the bow, kept the bow as you held the launch against the dock, the engine running slowly and the men kept jumping from dock to dock, from dock to deck, jostling each other and crowding into the cabin. eighty or ninety men were in the cabin as the launch pulled away. There were no lights in the cabin and no room to turn. Whoever was sitting down could not get up and whoever had his hand up could not get it down. As the launch ran in the dock.  Darkness through the ice, ice cracking against the launch, bumping and scraping against the launch, banging up against it until it struck a solid cake of ice, rolled to one side, and slowly came back to an even keel. The men began to feel water running against their feet as if from a hose. Cap shouted one, the boat is taking water.
