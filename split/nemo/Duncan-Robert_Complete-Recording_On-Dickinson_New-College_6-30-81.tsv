Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81	0.0	517.28	 All conclusions presented seem preposterous. So what I'm thinking of is under, beneath this, there seems to be such a period of Emily's in which he emerges even freer, and the term whereas people who didn't go through that period, I'm thinking about early structures that you actually go through that you can call upon. If you don't, I mean, after all, you're going to emerge in different kind of poetry. It's all we can say. It certainly pound did not go through some such structure because he just dismisses like an eighteenth century rationalist. Well, that ends up with no atheism, no God, nothing like as if nobody's talking about anything. So he's just quarrelsome with it.  Yet, at a very later stage, he wants to take up the subject. The same happens with the economics, with Emily's feel here, her intuitions are contemporaneous with Marx's. I mean, in Marx's case, the whole topics and the whole economics are being built of it, but the underlying intuitions, the underlying feeling that it permeates all of life, which is different from any that something permeates every level of your consciousness is not reductive. And that it is, and to say that it's the real thing is, so that's I think. It is, it becomes more and more.  Amazing as you read her that she does have all her sensibility is so related to that of people working in at the same time but in other places that she couldn't possibly have read specifically. I was amazed, for example, there are lines in her work that are identical with lines in Christina Rosetti. I would check the I checked the first time Christina Rosetti's poems were published and they weren't published until nineteen sixty two when a lot of the lines that are identical I mean, eighteen sixty two. There's no possible reference in absolute identical lines. And she did have ample broadband.  She had the Bronze poetry and that's one of the books she sent to the publisher and he's overawed and sends it back to her because it was a personal issue and even then rare and much sought after. But this is the kind of thing where you do, we need to turn in scholar just to find the manuscript when we want to look at the lines to find out, well, could she possibly write for Stephen Gilbert? So there was this amazing little nucleus of women that were born almost identical time. There was Susan Gilbert when they were born five days apart or something like that or a week apart or something like that. And then Helen Hunt Jackson was born a month.  before, and there's only four days actually between her and Christina Rosetti. I mean, I was born. Exactly. And we can turn around and say that the American household at the Amherst College level and the Rosetti household Oh, they're almost that close that we haven't got a separation in the social. But we can, when we go to the Dickensons, we realize that what has disappeared in America is this English household that the Dickens have. Amherst was English through and through and through. And so it was gonna be just like England. No, no, no, it's hard to pose that you were young.  Even let's say that your family we're continually marrying English just by race, but the American family is not English through and through, nor is the English family. Another little poem that I'll just read a short quote from in the same kind of sense of counting in the material world and contrasting it with another kind of infinity is poem sixty three, which includes the lines, if springs from winter's race.  Can the anemones be reckoned up? And can as an italic, they're invaluable italics. Donato one to two. That wasn't italicized in one to two. So it wasn't developed was as it is in there. It's the two that are italicized. What was your question? Oh, I was just saying that this is a place where that.  The two kinds of infinity are brought together and put into a relationship. The infinity is diffuse, but when it's the uncountable, it means it's numbers. And numbers are not diffused at all. It means that numbers extend. Remember the other picture we have is that there's a limit, and at the limit we're at the point of diffusion. But the Pythagoreans wouldn't have they called it the C, by the way. But the C here was that there was a C of the finite, that the finite was infinite, that the particular was infinite. That's what they faced, numbers.  which were absolute but just there, went all the way out and became a sea and undid the mind, couldn't take hold of it. And Emily is amazing because she's always facing both of them. Without flinching really. I mean, she loves the numberless and is ready to look at it and ready to look at each Robin and each anemone and so on. Also immediate to it. One of the debilities of our period, let's say of Folson's head or mine, for instance, is we went to Presyncratics or I'm still amazed and yet that's okay.  That's my disposition. I've got to search out Whitehead, Heidegger, so forth, and fill my head full of them. Now, this makes my whole experience of this. Emily keeps in Emily's library, we do not find the pre Socratics right around the corner. We don't and so forth, so that many of these things are experienced as initial, they're initial in me by the way. I don't read Heidegger because it's Heidegger, I read Heidegger because I recognize. But meanwhile, I have so complicated the picture that I've almost lost the immediacy of the great thing going to that manuscript is we're in immediacies regardless of our area, but that step has to be taken back for us from Heidegger. In Emily's case, some of her.  The most rich parts of her that I'm trying to think of the guy is IK, but what is his second name? The one one of her major text draws on Marvel or something. Marvel. Now, when I got to that text, I'm going to start a book on because that those texts underlie her more surely than Emerson does. In other words, she had find found a mind that was remarkably close. But what what at the very beginning, fifteen years ago, when people started writing on my poetry and Brumage was doing his thesis, he never finally got tenure without a thesis, but he kept sending me passages every year.  Merle Ponti and I began to realize no wonder I don't want to read Merle Ponti because it sounded like he was also reading my current journals. It sounded just like my current journals. I wrote back well, but Merle Ponti and I are not that different in age and we all draw on Curler and the Gestalt in addition to whatever other psychology is around. And that's what underlies it so that no wonder we're going to but also temperament underlies it because so many people read Gestalt don't end up sounding like Merle Ponti and there were not that many passages. Olsen also comes from certain Gestalt ideas. Nowhere sounds like this. Well, there can be that.  Emily was in this kind of redundancy in which he was robbed of the immediacy in this realm of that particular Whitman who was embracing Hegel and everything is robbed of enormous areas of immediacy. So he has big nonimmediate ideas that govern the form, so do I. Emily's she's got and a lot of hers, I think one could go back to that text, the marvel that she's always going back and say, okay, these areas are almost certain to be now no wonder they're diffused. What's remarkable is she'll find the infinite where it's not diffused because marvel is not about the resurgence.
