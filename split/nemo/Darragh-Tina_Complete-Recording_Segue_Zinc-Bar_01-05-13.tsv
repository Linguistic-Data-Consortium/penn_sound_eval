Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	0.0	370.53	 Lib Erty rings the doorbell at Gene Our Nation to discuss the results with a genetic counselor. When the door opens, she's surprised to find a room full of people dressed as crime scene investigators. A young woman in a white jumpsuit, with her forehead tattooed, I dream of genies, skateboards over to her. Just imagine a skateboard. Welcome. I'm Gal Corky. Are you here for your Burka? Welcome. I'm Gal Corky. Are you here for your Burka test result? Yes, I'm Lib Erty. And my doctor called to say that it was ready. Unfortunately, we just received a court order restraining us.  from releasing BERCA results until the test patent dispute is resolved. But I have good news for you. So you wouldn't have to come here for nothing. We ran an additional test at no extra charge and you don't have any mutations in your human rights gene. Gal was spinning around and doing a high five. Did you say human rights? That's a political doctrine, not a medical condition. That's so twentieth century. The new scanners we have can recognize inherent dignity. Lib thinks Gal is joking. And the gene for evil has a little black.  Hmm, there are tons of mutations for the human rights gene. There may be one for scratchy facial hair. Lib, eggs are on. So let's say I take a direct hit from the big scratch. I won't be so bad because you've got my back with your skateboard. Here at Gene Our Nation, we pride ourselves at being the soul of wit. So hanging out with horror can be experienced as good times. Lib, no longer laughing. Let me get this straight. If I think evil is all taken care of with a genetic test.  You won't notice that I can be incarcerated for an indefinite period of time without a lawyer, secretly flown to another country and tortured? Well, if you travel to a developing country, we do recommend keeping this test result with your passport. But I'm without human rights here in America. I could be picked up today as I leave this building and never be seen again. No way. Yes way. Liberty pulls a Washington Post newspaper article from her pocket and hands it to Gal. I carry this with me at all times to remind me of all the rights I don't have. Something as serious as the indefinite detention of citizens.  Becoming law was on page A six instead of on the front page. Well, at least it wasn't in the style section. Well, let's hope that the clinical trials for the human rights mutation drugs are successful, ASAP. Clinical trials? Yep, the pharmaceutical companies are all over this one. They need to get some new drugs in the pipeline because their top money makers are going generic. Don't worry, the National Institutes of Health Scientists are making sure the trials are the creme de la creme of research. Lube has an aha moment. So, US taxpayers are funding this?  Right? Terrific. By law, publicly funded clinical trial participants must be given standard of care for whatever is being tested. So, for a human rights drug, that means they'd get universal health care. Then, when the trials are completed, we'll use the march in rights of the Bai Dole Act to get the money to restructure our health system. Bai Dole? Is that some sort of welfare scam? Yeah, you could say that. For the drug companies, the government gives our money to researchers to test and patent drugs. Then, the pharmaceutical companies license them and make billions of dollars on our dime. But there's a little known clause.  law that says if the public safety is at risk, the government can march in and take back the patents. Deepening her voice. Universal healthcare for the public safety. It will be so cool when health is finally a human right. Well, health isn't a right. It's something we do. If we think of health as a right, then it's something we're owed, which by definition means it's something someone else has. In this case, that would be the healthcare corporations of Big Pharma. We don't want that. But we can take back our healthcare system and rebuild it as a cooperative enterprise with the profits from the patents on taxpayer funded research.  It'd be fun to do when we march in. Can I have my iPod? You bet, well, I'll be on a roll. Okay, and the, all right, so the final one, Erica will do with me. It's called a Hun by any other name, and there's a little handout that goes with it. Right, because there's a sing along at the end. Okay, a Hun by any other name. Levent and Quixie.  Best buds since attending fourth grade together at Petapsco Elementary School in Baltimore are down in the dumps. Their usual plans for attending a street festival celebrating Huns. Working class women from Baltimore, usually depicted with beehive hairdos and leopard skin capri pants, are on hold after hearing that the festival's organizer has trademarked the expression Hun. Dismayed, they wander into a coffee shop. Levent. I'm so upset by this Hun business because it reminds me of work. What's our brand? What does this do to our brand? Get your brand on. My brand was an honor student at Petapsco Elementary School.  Donuts for brand equity. What would brand do? I made my money the old fashioned way. I branded it. I've never met a brand I didn't. Quixie. Stop already.
