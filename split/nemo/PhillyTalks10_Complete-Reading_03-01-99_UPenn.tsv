Employment feigned identity, his second natured jacket, small light to see and canvas tunnel barred careen. Inflicted benefactor claimed the wind that brushed the canvas, at stake a replication slashing strokes devoid of testament.  panel in the hill succumb again to walls, absent patrons dry the passion, made coherent cope, to soothe the sleep, lose what won't be dreamt, the book's metonymy, low impact input, eerie realist security, safety in the subject matter, block contamination, monody in vacuo, balanced isolation.  Contextual, the rendered foreign precipice, surrendered cake, elation disavowed, a chance confirmed the contact, heretic. Wand will bring the moon dust, comfort, mask, remaining dialect, attention captured, trivia, bereft, intoxicola. By restitution, storm the link, come alive, bereft, clawed at luminators, nine one one to bed.  Beg the right address. Going onto one knee with a spoon from one generation to the next. Going onto one knee with a spoon for nothing to be left vulnerable. Going onto one knee with a spoon, taking orders from ceremony. Going onto one knee with a spoon, the loss of his mother's smile. Going onto one knee with a string. Bread sculpted into a cluster of grapes. Going onto one knee with a string. Ladles for cheese making hang in the cassafici.  From one generation to the next, going onto one knee with a spoon. Furniture fabric depicting the farm worker's struggle, going onto one knee with a spoon. The people will neither read nor write, going onto one knee with a spoon, inheriting seemingly ghostlike qualities, going onto one knee with a spoon. Going onto one knee by sedition, the troubled boy is a laughing stock, a world lit only by fire, the destruction of letters by fire. Going onto one knee by sedition, picking through ruins was drying there.  Hands out, going onto one knee by sedition to recognize the investment. Going onto one knee by sedition, going onto one knee with a spoon, developing a unique bond with a wolf, salted wounds, going onto one knee with a spoon, flagellates, crumbling mirepoix, going onto one knee with a spoon, gaze of the underwhelmed. That's it, thanks.  Hello. That was really nice. I just want to thank Steve because I think.  Part of the reason we're here is because we met about two years ago in up in Sonoma at the university where David and I read and we met and we talked and then Steve Tills asked us back to talk because we talked about our mutual interest in troubadour poetry and then he asked us to give that discussion or talk that we did up in Petaluma and from that I think came this event here and thanks to Louis for putting this together and for doing these talks. So I'm going to read some poems from Artificial Heart and I'm going to think I read a couple of new poems and I'll come back to poems in Artificial Heart.  This is like in seven little pieces, but I won't read the numbers. New picnic time. Out of this close horizon, there are animals breathing, unlike a child's drawing of a nativity, orbiting circles with brown X's. Farther off, pedestrians make parallel lines and collapse into distance, or becoming one of several skylines in charcoal or finger paint. At zero hour, an earth unwrites itself, becomes an indelible number line counting backward to embrace its new horizon, indefatigable.  zero, the high lit window, a person tethered to a desk, this city and its outline, its rivers, its cemeteries. Invisible, the orchard keeper's mansion is everywhere, the heart becomes one, last stone of an existing grove and a squatter's earth, thus in persons and in plants also, stone, and the brilliant element of fire, and to the helix, and throughout the electrics, salt. Beyond this image, decomposing, desire, and as always with the mouth there is earth, because it calls, fear is redundant, and that animal sound in late night is only its own speech becoming its own speech.  one, becoming heir, books outlasting, buildings outlast sweat, and the broken human form of body labors. Whose face is the same as another? Nothing spoke for itself, every action implied a rhetoric so it may recognize itself, to teach, to celebrate virtue, to persuade by example, to lead the court to its ideal self through wonder, same page, same fable trajectory, a window, the young father dreaming, a hand, a face, a feeling, it was a sound he heard. The way of earthworms in coffins, of dead infants, cobwebs and deformity, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, of windows, windows, windows, windows, window, window, window, window, window, window,  And the children they expose, the signs they carry, shame.
