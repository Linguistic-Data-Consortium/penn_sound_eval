In a monologue, any one idea stands on stage for seven seconds, as though the idea has somehow become the presenter of the monologue. That's right. I mean, the question really becomes, why are we writing? Who is it that's writing? Why did that start writing? What started writing? What is writing to what? And so on. I mean, there are all those questions.  Is it, you know, an eye? Is it an eye? And I'm not so sure that I want to invest everything that I'm doing in any particular place, one place, because I think, you know, time and space are always going to be complicated. And I don't think the writing comes out of any one place. I think it comes out of this, as I've said, this molange of debris, forces, factors, operators. It's, you know, it's complex. And so, yeah. But I'm really interested. But curiously, here, you then, but you and I are here now. Well, I love that.  Trying to bind. Right. I mean, you put it's an address, you know. To the supposition. I love I'll be, Andy Warhol, I'll be. In other words, we're going to try some identity on for size. I will be, and you will be. Okay, everyone. You be. You be. You be. Oh, I guess you were talking about like Walgreens or something. It's an over and I'll be. Oh, sorry. That's over. Kicking at a bee. This is what we get with Bill, with the nice rest. That's right. But it's not I'll be George Patton. I'll be some solid character. It's Andy Warhol, of course.  actually a mirror, you know, whatever Andy was not interested in identity and selfhood. And so if you and I are here now, seems like a solid social sociality, you know, an agreement that we can be meaning, we can make meaning together, we can co create this thing that's happening here maybe in this poem. And then in doing so, I'll be Andy Warhol and you be everyone else. What we've established is a persona that is an anti persona. And set against that is a kind of an entire audience, maybe everyone who reads this poem or who is sitting in the crowd.  It gets to be everyone else, but it's not distinct from the I, because I will be nothing, and you will be nothing. Anti Ted Talk. Anti Ted Talk. Say a little more about anti Ted Talk, because I think Ted Talk, I don't think that Larry was thinking of Ted Talk, but that is everything that's wrong with speaking to an audience. Yeah, I think it's dislodging monologue from like its authoritarianism, and it's making the poem's existence is an invitation for connection between audience and speaker. So it's inviting the collaboration of both parts that create the occasion for meeting anyway.  You listen. I know you don't. It says, which comes in parts of certainty the monologue doesn't have. It's certain because of the relationship, not because of what the monologue is saying. That's right. Before, we were talking about the eye, and I was disowning the eye. But at a certain point, you actually have to own up to it. You have to say, all right, I'll take this on for this moment, just for the absolute fact of connection. And that's not ironic in the least. That's actually quite seems undercut ethical. Absolutely, it's ethical. But is irony unethical? I don't think no, it isn't, of course. Yeah. But the problem with TED talk ism is that.  The implication is we need more than fifteen minutes of fame. We need to have a serious conversation, and I've been through this, and you're an audience who's listening to me, and it's usually very personal and very philosophical. But it's in fact fifteen fucking minutes of fame, a TED talk. You're trying to get through you want to get to a place that's more than that, I think. Absolutely. And I mean, yes, I can't say anything more than that. I mean, I really agree with what you're saying. I think that, again, we've got.  Lots of straw people around, and they walk around looking and sounding very important only because we elected them. And we can just diselect them, I think. And when we do that, we get to take up altogether different roles in some kind of cooperative. In this case, it's all stages of drama, but obviously, you know, it's everywhere that we are. So Bill, another thought on this piece before we turn to the third one? Well, Eamon, I love this typical inversion that we get here between a crowd and an empty stage, or a stage and an empty crowd. That's kind of unfortunate, isn't it?  I mean, I didn't want to imply that the crowd was empty, altogether empty, but I think that there's a possibility that a lot of times it is because the crowd comes with expectations that invest the performance with more solidity and importance than it actually deserves. And to me, all that does is empty the crowd's expectations onto the stage where those expectations didn't act out. I don't want that. I want complete contingency. I want the accident, the unpredictable. I want to feel that there might be all kinds of encounters that happen at any given time. We just need to be open.  And embedded in though in that.
