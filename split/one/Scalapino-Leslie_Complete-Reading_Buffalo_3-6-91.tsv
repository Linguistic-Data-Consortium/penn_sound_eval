Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91	0.168	345.344	The desert brush is burning, the cocoon of hammock or ((sack)) which is the ((hennaed)) man who's carried by the boys. They're carrying the wrapped cocoon on poles the earth before them is cracked. But above it, it is lined, covered by the heavy sky. They trot on its sticks. It isn't being dead. The only Paradise is not being dead. The hennaed man is, but the boys aren't. From above the lines and ridges of the brown desert, when one is flying, only when one is flying. It is a waste area. ((Amid)) one's heart as which an organ pumping blood, it is illuminated. A barren desert with tracks on it, a track leading to a vast lake which is a pale blue from above. If this occurs, it goes into it at the moment it is seen. I saw it when flying. There's a haze of billows of smoke and ridges. Man who's risen by sycophancy is remembered for no reason as defenses. Yet one is continuing, and seeing whatever occurs still Cocooned sack in which the hennaed man is swathed and carried by the boys is occurring, their walking sticks on the cracks ((is)) manual. On a hot day ((rode)) in the cab across the city and the cab driver played hymns on the radio while singing a different hymn at the same time in a cracked voice. If he wasn't singing counter to a hymn, he'd murmur about how we have to believe to it. I had the thought, ((He)) can't be without this in the city driving because it's occurring. Occurring is in silence, this hasn't happened before The grasshopper is invisible and the man puts his ((member)) into it, the halves that aren't seen in the dark. These men who are cousins are construction workers who were nomads for the joy of it. To have a job so as to leave. It comes from this. This is a way of life in which there are no marriages or connections though there are children. Catching up to the hennaed man whose head is hanging out of the sack. Flippering head to head on the desert, it's hanging from the cocoon, swaying on poles on which the stick, starving boys are struggling. There is no minute movement. Laying them out on a mat, dabbed to clean them, though the hennaed man is the one dead who'd been alive for only an instant and they who aren't wrapped him and are moving with him toward the billows of fire on the plain. ((That or spirals.)) They are not moving to one of these. The swans flap up honking or hooping as they're coming, shimmering in a ~V on itself so they're simply the thin topaz air. The desert is crisscrossed with a few roads from ((above.)) The man loving celebrities and the wife are in a car that has broken down on one, out there. They get out and are standing beside it, which is pushed out and is burning in front of them and there's nothing inside them. The muscular movement is coming from some black robes blowing with no eyeholes. That or outside them, the man and the wife who's weeping with the burning car outside them. He's quiet, ((isn't jeering)) from inside movement from in him standing. The desert is outside them ((and)) the moon is. It's out in front of them so that it's in it. Bright moon is in front of them In the ((deserts that's)) on fire, the black robes blow out on it, not in the line of the spirals. They're going at a trajectory with no movement in them. I want so much to be w- where I was before I was me, trying to be in the night as day, pushed out and so it is in the day when it is night. The moon is in front. It is on the plane. The moon is in front of me so that there is nothing in me. Yet on the rim the girl spits on me for a flicker. The girl spitting on me, her being so immature that the friends stare at me, creating a conformity to which if I object I'm merely self serving. It is invalidated by having occurred in me. To be what I am before I am me. It is pushed out in the moon in front which is before rather than me. Looking at the dog lying in the gutter whose thin layer of sheath of fat is seen on the ribcage, which is open. The friends create ((this)) conformity with is limpid, occurring before. They don't have faces staring. Why did one see them before? They'd say it is self serving to see this and so anticipating. Breathing in and out. The breath is in the moon that is out side in front. It isn't in me so it doesn't matter if one is walking. It is in the trees that are in the blue sky. Birds go by. So the day is in the night at once. I felt joyful these events happened slowly before me He's holding the tips of the ribcage like fins and the member put in the end. ((Comes)) {cough} had been on it. It occurs in the present but before me Seeing on the street the blue burnished face banged up, walking, I followed him who'd been on the garbage. He continues walking ahead. Being outside is simple. It's pushed out there. The tool is completely distorting and having a feeling highlights that putting a lining under it Walking ((in)) is in it This lovely moon that was out there in the day orb in front of me. The hennaed man alive for only an instant had never been alive and so the breath is outside, without the moon. This stick starving boy's trotting on the desert carrying the cocoon as seen in reverse. I couldn't sleep and yet couldn't sit up, either. I have to see the night but with my eyes closed from being tired and therefore immature Communal is completely simple being outside, only with the moon in front of me, walking with no one there, is not doing anything. What one sees inside. It is moving backwards or turned around, the hennaed man alive for only an instant who's never been alive is it. And ((not)) being myself riding up the street a while ago, people coming out or standing	Subject
