Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81	0.151	517.28	(()) seem preposterous, some of it ((but so I)) ((underl- un-)) beneath this there seems to be such a ((period)) of ((Emily's)) Luckily {laugh} in which he emerges even freer than the (()) whereas people do ((go through that period)) uh (()) I'm thinking about early structures that you actually go through, that you can ((call upon)) (()) ((you know)) (()) after all you've ((got a)) (()) different kind of poetry (()) ((Mhm.)) (()) ((certainly)) Pound did not go through some such structure ((because)) he just dismisses like an eighteenth century rationalist Well, that ends up with no atheism, no god, nothing, ((like)) as if nobody's talking about it (()) so he's just ((across from it)) (()) It's not accessible yet at a very later stage he wants to take up the subject. The same happens with the economics, with e- Emily's (()) here her intuitions are contemporaneous with Marx's. I mean, in Marx's case a whole politics and a whole economics is being built (()) but the underlying intuitions, the underlying feeling that it permeates all life (()) ((which is different from)) (()) is= is the (())  that something permeates every level of your consciousness is not ((reductive)) and= and= and= and= and that it it Right. and to say that ((it's)) the real thing is ((so= so)) (()) Mhm. It is i- i- it becomes more and more amazing as you read her that she does have all {NSV} # h- her sensibility is so related to that of people working in at the same time but in other places that she couldn't possibly have read specifically (()) I- I was amazed, for example, ((with)) (()) lines in her work. They're identical with lines in Christina Rossetti ((and)) Ah, yes. I would ((check)) ((the)) # I checked the first time her # Christina Rossetti's poems were published and they weren't published until nineteen sixty two and a lot of the lines that are identi- # I mean eighteen sixty two. (()) ((she's)) got no reference Christina Rossetti (()) and there's= there's no possible reference in (()) absolute identical lines. And she did have Emily Bronte's poetry, she had the Brontes' poetry and= and that's one of the # that's the book she sends ((to the)) publisher and he's= he's overawed and sends it back to her because it was a first edition. Yeah. ((Yeah.)) Mhm. Even then rare and much sought after uh but (()) this is the kind of thing where you do ((we)) (()) # we need to (()) scholar just to find (()) # to find the manuscript ((when)) we all look at the lines to find out how could she possibly write a Christina Rossetti ((poem.)) Mhm. (()) there was this uh amazing (()) nucleus of wo- women that were born all # almost a identical time, there was Susan Gilbert and they were born five days or something like that, or a week apart or something like that ((and then)) Helen Hunt Jackson was born a month before and there's only four days actually between her and= and Christina Rossetti and (()) ((born)) (()) (()) exactly the same time. And= and we can s- # turn around and say that the American household at the Amherst College level and the Rossetti h- household Oh, they're almost identical. They're that (()) # that close that we ((haven't)) got a separation ((in= in= in= in)) the ((social)) but we can Yeah. when we go to the Dickinsons we realize that= that= that what has disappeared in America is this English household that the ((Dickinsons)) Amherst's was ((in)) English through and through and through. And so it ((was)) going to be just like ((England)) ((not= not= not)) # it's hard to pose. that she ((were even)) (()) ((say)) that= that your family ((were)) continually marrying ((and= and= and= and)) English just by race but= but the American family is not English through and through ((and)) nor is the English family (()) Yeah. Yeah. Another little poem that I'll just (()) read a (()) a ((short)) ((quote)) from uh in the same kind of ((sense)) of counting in the material world and contrasting it with another kind of infinity is poem sixty three which includes the line ((it)) springs from winter's rise can the anemones be reckoned up. {NSV} ((Mhm.)) And can is in italics ((here)) (()) italics. ((Going on to one to Sue)) That was an italicized one to ((Sue?)) No, it wasn't. uh (()) was. That as it is in there. The two that are italicized # yeah, okay (()) ((What)) (()) Oh, I was just saying that this is a= a= a= a place where that ((Can't)) be counted up. Yep. # the {NSV} the two kinds of infinity are brought together and= and= and Mhm. uh put into a relationship and she (()) infinity is= is= is diffuse but when it's the ((impalpable)) it means it's numbers. Mhm. And numbers are not diffuse at all. It means that numbers extend. Remember the other picture we have is that there's a limit (()) and at the limit we're at the point of diffusion but= it= but it # but the # the ((factory is)) (()) # they called it the sea, by the way. Mhm. But the sea here was that there was was a sea of the finite, that the finite was infinite, that the particular was i- infinite. That's what they ((faced,)) numbers which were= were (()) ((but just there)) ((went all way up)) and= and became a sea and undid the mind ((but they called it)) And Emily is amazing because she's always facing both of them Mhm. Without flinching, really. ((And then)) she= she loves the= the numberless and is ready to= to look at # ready to look at each robin and each anemone in someone. Also immediate to it, one= of= the= one of the debilities of our period, let's say a (()) ((head)) or mind, for instance ((we)) (()) pre-Socratics or= or I'm still amazed a- and yet that's okay, that's my disposition, I- I've got the (()) ((why)) (()) Heidegger so forth and so on ((fill my head full of them.)) ((None)) of this ((makes my whole experience of this.)) Emily keeps # Em- # in Emily's library we do not find the pre-Socratics right around the corner. ((We don't)) and so forth, so that many of these things ((we)) experienced as initial, they're initial in me by the way, I (()) I don't read Heidegger because it's Heidegger, I read Heidegger because I ((recognize)) but meanwhile I have so complicated the picture that I've almost lost the immediacy of= of {NSV} the great thing ((going to that)) manuscript is (()) ((immediacies,)) regardless of ((my theory)) but that's # that has to be taken back for us from Heidegger. In= in Emily's case some of the most Mhm. rich parts of her (()) # I'm trying to think of (()) the guy is. is= is ((~I, ~K)) # but what is his second name. The one # one of her major texts she draws on (()) ((I k-)) (()) (()) M- m- m- m- ((marvel)) (()) ((Marvel,)) right. Now when= when I got to that text I- I'm ((going to start)) (()) ((because)) that # those texts underlie her more surely than Emerson does. (()) ((marvel,)) right. In other words she had find # found a mind that was remarkably close but wh- wh- ((what)) # at the very beginning, fifteen years ago when people started writing on my poetry and (()) was doing his thesis, he never (()) # he might have ((gotten)) tenure without a thesis, but he kept sending me passages ((of)) (()) and I began to realize, no wonder I don't want to read (()) because it sounded like (()) ((he was also)) reading my (()) journal. It sounded just like my (()) journals. I wrote back, Well, (()) and I are not that different in age and we all draw on (()) and the ((gestalt)) in addition to whatever other ((psychologies)) (()) and= and= and= and that is what underlies it.    {laugh} So that no wonder (()) but als- also temperament underlies it because (()) so many people who (()) ((gestalt)) don't end up sounding like (()) and= and= and= and Duncan and= and= and there were not that many passages {laugh} (()) comes from certain ((gestalt))  ideas. Nowhere sounds like ((it.)) Well, there can be that and= and Emily was in this kind of redundancy in which she was robbed of the (()) # of the immediacy. In this realm of the # of= of= that= of that ((particular)) (()) Whitman, who was Mhm. embracing Hegel and everything is robbed of enormous areas of immediacy so he has big, non-immediate ideas ((and then)) (()) so do I. Emily's (()) # she's got and a lot of hers I think one could go back to that text, the ((marvel,)) that she's always going back, and say okay, these areas are almost certain to be now no wonder they're diffuse, what's remarkable is she'll find the infinite where it's not diffuse. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Because ((marvel's)) not about the (())	Speaker1
