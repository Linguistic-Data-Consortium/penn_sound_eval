Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	0.23	482.22	Feels like home to me. I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa. Can everybody hear me alright? Okay. um I'm going to read in two parts. I'm going to read first from the new book lost parkour psalms and then I'm going to read some new amulet sonnets. So um this book, lost parkour psalms, is= is just out in France and it's a dual edition in French and in English. Th- th- # separate books but out at the same time and in the title ps- psalms, within psalms, alms is in parentheses. And about parkour I just wanted to say that it's an activity or a practice of moving rapidly usually+ through an urban setting as would a stunt person be moving and so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks involved in contemplative practice and just considering the psalm as a poetic form. So beginning with a epigram from Joanne Kyger. The place we are going is the place we were before we were born. Psalm undone. Rushing to contain and not complain what is sung Do this without assault. Therefore exist everywhere. I will make a character and one of my characters not a letter nor a frown will be undone by a new landscape. ((Missive)) psalm. How to be truthful to one's ((woods)) or were they. Never have seen such a text sudden eruptions scribes of erudite biddings ask to whom shall I send my. Vanishing psalm. I can vanish every minute of every day but to where shall I vanish? Your pleasure is in choosing the vanishing point. If you are accomplished at leaving the world in this manner at what are you accomplished? Apothecary psalm. I am so open to you who do not exist except in dream and you always reply just as I like from your book of dream. Uninscribed psalm. The hours I have forgotten to inscribe are written in silence. where speech would rather summon air overrun with visitations. The hours belong to no one. We stand or recline to incite them. Obligatory murmuring or rushing words are as nonsensical as refusing to greet your beloved. There is another way. Transparent psalm. Surrender to the form which does not appear or cling to the house you cradle and what is the third way within which appears no argument, meaning all imperatives become transparent illustrating the argument as a skeleton which impels movement so you don't complain of it or even remember this inner matter as you lift a cup to your lips. Insistence psalm. What are you leaving? A body for thoughts of a body? Where you are incessantly going is a type of insistence. An invisible leaning. You walk this way because your legs carry you. You allow yourself to expire because each morning you awaken. Psalm for expectancy. Success is also a sudden barricade from accomplishment. In cities as elsewhere we live only so long. I am just a visitor here, speaks the Rebbe when questioned as to his modest abode, a cot in a single room amid piles of books. This is just a text meaning nothing is recoverable except your recovery. This one I'm dedicating to Lisa. Psalm for conspirators. Conspirators awaken on their pages in cabinets and fences, in states of such I have never seen or states I have loved as dearly as delirium. They ((key)) or ((call)) variously. Where I am ((taught,)) they flag without such pulleys, levers, ((trance)) and delicate nets, I'm lost. Psalm in a foreign language. ((Jades)) is ((~J)) my souvenir well. Vying festoon or sacrament tour of the heart. A tout with vines consulting beauty of mesh genomics. Armor or trove as injury oh sorcerers, oh miser, oh heroine, this voyage of moon. Treasons (()) your ((taut)) joint (()) of fate. Psalm for monumental. In an airless, airless, airless, room why are we using their definition of success? What is monument? Monumental. Psalm beneath loss. Beneath the place of sorrow is another place. So miniscule found, grown larger by minuet. To be presentable is something beneath the scene ((seen)) and ((seen)) How is loss perfect? The lost psalm is not yet internally known. To write it again is to unlatch, to transmit. Any poem is constantly written, to verb and not to noun, constantly transmitted and continuously translated, rapid transit makes us dull, pulling and dismissing our most	Speaker1
