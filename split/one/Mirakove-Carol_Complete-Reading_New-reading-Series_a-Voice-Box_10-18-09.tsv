It takes a multitude Gypsy, ((am I seeing)) the subtle light, ((can tent,)) bang bang whenever I read, each sentence erases the one before it Juicy Fruit gum has a blog. It's actually true {laugh} ((Unaware)) you are not catching the light is still from where you were I saw houses of water in which things got new names to mark it The bed on the door, the ceiling hanging from the linen. There are no known examples of underwear in memory, arches wrecking the curve in their own appeal It would be the end of air if not for grounding the axiom in soil in soil oxygen, proportion consumer, upper limit, shallow waiting Falling like a NASDAQ rocket, wishful thinking in fair use, flood mops and soot rags, honored and onward, honored and onward, honored and onward hydro pirates title and persistent. Whenever I read each sentence, take it back War is at planet How will it feel if the rocks disappear if all that is left is dirt I walk home like a ghost. I am Puss in Boots and meat on bones.

Here's a postcard. I'm a beach Morning Glory If you will forgive, the wind, a ((leg)), vines up your torso in blooms for a day, dies every night when you are not looking Another palpable bud blossoms for even time is only certain and yours' to lose in the next hello you are, bursting with dawn uh I'm going to read just one poem from a newer project called Loves Kill- # uh sorry, Love Kills Hate, um in which I spend a lot of time uh sort of looking at things that are going on in Latin America and um {lipsmack} I don't know if any of you caught Zizek on Democracy Now last week but he actually uh had some issues with um people looking at Latin America and said, You know whether you're looking at Venezuela or Bolivia, we can't use what's happening there as a model. And I said to my beloved spouse Jenn, I think that that's a really simplistic argument. And she said, I'm going to write to Zizek and tell him that you think he's simplistic. {laugh} In any case I'm still going to go ahead {laugh} with the project, and I'm going to read {lipsmack} um one poem that's a translation of uh an excerpt from a book by a poet named Florencia Walfisch who is a year older than me, living in um Argentina and she went to um Oaxaca in ninety seven at the age of twenty seven and um was really struck by the melding of people from different cultures and living in what she perceived as a harmony um and then of course {lipsmack} uh between ninety seven and two thousand four when the book was published  all kinds of very dramatic things were happening in her home country of Argentina which I imagine influenced this text Oh, and the book is called uh Soup of Garlic and Mezcal The mirror disrobing anterior memory not redundant In it she can hold her presence in hands of ((loaded)) flowers and invents a thousand forms in which to hope In rotation that kind of exceeding like identity and word That she must say newborn, tentative, or animal She can pull pain from the root, drop by drop into her time bound heart Where she says that she must say newborn, tentative, or animal, she puts her lips to the pain until she pulls the body slowly from the root Where she says she must hold a great aim, the presence of which does not yet exist Where she says that she must say the body of herself that reappears in the center of her name she releases where she says she must say she is not consumed where she says that she must not say that. Where she says, I kissed you all over, she must also say, I always loved you She want to bankrupt her skirt of its creases, as if she could possibly Creature shouts in the middle of the dark Stumbling over shadow falls She slides until she finds her feet and gets on lacking consciousness and every so ((oft)) she is rocked	Subject
