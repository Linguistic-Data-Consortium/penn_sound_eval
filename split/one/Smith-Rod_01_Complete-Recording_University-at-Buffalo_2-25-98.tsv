I ((entire)) toward an ((~M)) placard. I am not placard. Show me coming back to me. Show me no placard coming back to me. Placard me but with only you. So I mean couldn't me placard be a good one? Be a placard. Be a placard, that secret placard beside a nice tree. Be like that orgone thing. Nodules are cats keeping me (()) meow plac- placard meow or cuss at me. Placard ((Tony,)) placard toy. Topaz and show me me as a placard to be. Placed inside ((meat)) free zone and well, it could be a backcountry communist acupressure world ((mind)) genre, all that beeping stuff in a speaking box. Time is it? The narrative quiescence of the abstract seen in the book jacket photo doesn't have a setting so much as a latent impenetrability not unlike the lenient, bitter, bracketed latticework of emotion I'm ((culled)) to re-encode for no reason, lost or lone and lost, or leftover and lost, or lacking loss based in a brick sickness of stilted words, ((the scene)) leans in, fortunate, unmasked, taking its saturate incongruence to the hilt. Witness the solemnity as excuse for however c- central such simple shapes sound in a show of colored lights under the eaves and notice how subtle the ((supple)) learn the other's (()) violence for a shapeless mass or a lo- loaf of tawdry Shinola or a list of fictions like days, like stars burning, like ideologically judgmental harmonies out of their trance awake.  Patience plus thematically lactate spirits in neutral space. Yearn into the dreary cone, it passed pale to taunt that step, that blatant ((sleep,)) that singular individual instance of one it. Weird. Yet monochromatic war was no longer satire so much as some technophobe totem experimenting over the balcony in the gas he goes to call and is stirred by but managed somehow to boast anyway, something about a drinking problem or a missing arm or an alien culture but I stopped it there, feeling the terms alien and culture extremely personal and felt the danger, the literal urge in fact to actually say something about micromanaged alienation and the experience of audience partici- participation as portrayed in the soft porn novels of my own ((two tiered)) society. Nevertheless this urge passed and was lost, was gone, was jettisoned, was judiciously disearned and left out. The laze of the intervenient chaos locked in on the smiling clenched dust revealed to me in that light thus spoke or the sound of a footstep which unfolds, which for it to be what it is for itself I give up and look up. This is why the sick child falters in a field of abstraction. This is why chaos can be so disheartening to those who would control their lives. This is why the stalactites+ must be left in place for the next clumsy oaf. You are not here. Heads or tails with ink in it. Open and or closed in the amused swerving al- almost always unable to find the underlined passage. Time did I start? ((What?)) Identity as the cause of warts. I have a toad. Its name is Boober. Boober the toad. Boober raises rabbits. The rabbits live in a big can named big can. Mostly they complain. Boober bangs the lid for them to calm down. It doesn't work. At the last annual convening of the International Monetary Fund Boober spoke to a packed house about toad stuff. He talked it up good and the bankers banged their lids. Sometimes Boober and me smoke pot. Other times, usually while banging, Boober has a twi- twitch of sympathy but always for himself and he calls the phone and= it= and it says anything so he bangs on it too and I feel sorry for it and hang around with all these other things in the room wondering about this banging toad in my life. Boober gets a by gosh, by golly expression, which on a toad looks like all their other expressions but that ((total thing)) little girl I don't work in no candy kitchen. (()) I don't sell no chewing gum. Do any of you folks have toads? Can you help me through my toad difficulties? Sometimes I lie asleep all night. I just can't take it anywhere anymore. Sometimes I think I should get a frog instead but my friend ((Jiggs Casey)) has a frog and he built a nuclear weapon= weapon with it and I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't call me anymore. You can actually see Boober on the web. Boober uh # Bill (()) did this just terrific postcard collage o- of Boober and it's ((uh)) on (()) Moriarty's magazine site called ((Non.)) I think you can get it on the ~EPC. Definitely check it out. There's like	Speaker1
