Gas station {cough} ((for)) gas station Technological, annoying, miniature asshole ((of the stars.)) This is no longer the (()) ((trouble)) but a ((coin in the right place)) can do wonders. To be reckoned with ((on)) all ((trips,)) large as well as small. ((Beyond night)) and its ((Labrador retriever)) the dim tree (()) up into the ((star post)) outlined in blossoms compressed to silhouettes ((almond, olive)) (()) morning glory. Chaucer. A love poem. {laugh} {laugh} It occurred to me that I should have (()) that eight years ago when I ((wrote)) the poem. The title is just Chaucer. ((Into that)) society, Geoffrey Chaucer was born, and he died without seeing it returned to the way he knew it partly through his agency. So I can imagine the sight of the peasants ((drawn up)) outside the walls of his city drove fear into the hearts of King Richard and his nobles, of which Chaucer was one, and barely escaped with his life. after the reprisals that ((followed)) hard upon the unwillingness of privilege to dispense with ((its)) ornaments. Fortunately, Sir John (()) then a judge in the courts, was a good friend of Chaucer's, when a poet might not have lived to produce the works he did. And it was, of the hundred twenty projected tales, Chaucer managed to complete only a handful and it is on these that his reputation rests. And ((when)) the plague like a guided missile, struck down half of London it did so by bypassing the city's chief customs inspector. ((As)) Chaucer escaped both the plague and the rebellion of the peasants, so I escaped not knowing you, et cetera, et cetera. {cough} Leap year. In ((a)) language of the spirit one of the waist high metal ashtrays is on fire. Ah, in the ((lounge)) of the spirit. I ((was)) on the verge of waking up ((in it)) as that (()) is clearly melting into the sky. The sky ((and the)) (()) as if (()) ((were)) (()) and the way out were to paint everything turquoise. The night ((crowded)) by stars, people ((drinking)) everything in sight, a ((bus)) taking (()) from one city river to another ((charred in glow)) of not knowing the ending. {cough} The ((Brooklynese)) capital. Some (()) for (()) The Asia of New England. The ((parasol bath.)) The (()) brandisher. ((Xeno's)) gold (()) cookies. There will be (()) There will be (()) ((Masonic)) (()) The deflector of the night's (()) ((devouring)) omelets. The ((beret)) of age. Some ((joke)) The ((whale)) cartel. The ((green)) fingered dawn. The critic of peace. ((When does)) (()) The (()) of Tuscany. Mortality's reiterator. (()) river whitefish. The ((foot wigwam.)) These ((distractions, they are)) (()) The second baseman of composers. I think that's Chopin. {laugh} I (()) can check. Never been able to check before. I should check. Yes. Wait (()) The light slurper. The weekend divider. The ((face's mood ring.)) Ambition's green monster. The smegma convention. Card carrier of the (()) (()) ((your)) (()) The ((mouse that plucked the sea stallion's aimlessness.)) The Anglophile of languages. (()) tourniquet. The gravy supper. The (()) ((Tennis)) victims. ((Sewer)) (()) ((ballet)) The Netherlands of lips. The mouth flounder. The parasitic trade. ((Pam)) and ((Jerry's)) The pill pushing race. The ((fisher for midnight oil's Cupid.)) The cigarette pyromaniac. The mosquito beach. Sunset's hamburger extender. The ((Brooklynese)) capital. The Gatling gun of despair. The tongue motel.

The deflator of leisure. The barber's friend. The fried egg dish. The winter (()) The (()) The (()) ((city.)) The George Washington Carver of boredom. The schnitzel of the Alps. The ((smell way.)) Lines. As (()) an evening taken together by the same thing. The morning air ((dents a jar of tulips)) and (()) affairs are wasted with a dispatch of elegant theory. The empowerment of leaders begins its arduous journey through permanent display, pink. A parade of points, green, turning out products. (()) highway to ((art,)) to (()) ((for)) the free movement through elevated channels causes the scale to fold, the council to abandon. (()) {cough} (()) ((If I)) (()) ((sleeping)) and (()) and the baby are sleeping and the earth is a ((wheel)) on a blanket of emeralds held out at arm's length to ((locate)) the smell of gardenia and ((ingenious)) honeysuckle ((here by)) the precise moment the north light turns illuminating the wildly creaking carriage against the east (()) showing ((a)) layer of boxes of unopened presents (()) et cetera. The paint beginning to peel. ((Cold)) wind rushing past ((colored)) insulation and ((stopped but)) there over her head. (()) then I think the fathers of the world are out of their minds, getting up in unison, leaving warm beds and (()) our cold feet past the ((cold)) bathroom.	Speaker1
