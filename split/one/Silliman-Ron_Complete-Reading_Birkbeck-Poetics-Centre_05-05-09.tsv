Standing over an open ditch in the pouring rain, think of the word gullywasher. My bones are aching and my brain is weak. I think I'm standing on a stubborn ((street)) Mowed at dawn when the sky has lightened, minute before the first sun appears when all light is true light, every color muted Pieces of a music hidden in the mind by memory's collaboration with all other musics emerges now and emerges again anew in the middle of a dream. Every song a new song, each now occurred for the first time Today I wake with a roaring thirst. We put the fab in fabric All effects are special. You'll wake the birds. Two weights, twin twenty five pound barbells resting on the rug, implicit challenge. The roses have grown wild in the corners, rising high over the wire fence. This compost a small mountain out of whose sides weeds arise. Steam wisps over the lip of the cup. Hot tea at the brink of a hot day. It's summertime. ((Until after)) an early evening movie, the sun's still out. The day crowded with hours gathers at the horizon An intricate dream in which I return to an old job site. People now ((by)) my current coworkers. Both do ((it)) miraculously to a mining town in the Sierras ((about ankle,)) tiny sparrow chases huge vulture high over the freeway, zigzag path {lipsmack} out by the wetlands A walkway connects buildings over the street which from twelve stories up I look down upon Old brick buildings of Larimer Square all ((googawed)) up, boutiques for tourists that stay open until nine at night. What is morning for? Form sets the reader's expectations laying the ground for a happy or unhappy reading experience A sentence laid forgotten under the tree by the reservoir's edge ((Burned)) in the ((dark,)) this morning my lip is blistered Weight bends the sunflower, smell of fog. Imagination seizes power. But power ((defies)) imagination One bad habit is to leave underwear on the scale in the bathroom. Today, a squirrel sits atop the sunflower pulling seeds out one by one Fuchsias open, their pale pink outer petals turned up. That was a dream. This is not. I'm not really traveling by submarine to a conference in Europe of paint stores. I'm trying to imagine what it will feel like when the surgeon cuts ((one)) eye Mockingbird imitates trio of crickets, then quiets once the sun rises Standing, the blood rushes to my feet, old familiar river. Notebooks, phones, forms. The day is warm. Salt ring stain circles the shirt. In ((our)) private life, the old actress, now senile, was a surrealist. We pick our way through the cobwebbed residue of her home. Shower steam fogs my glasses. Lift the dead tree stump back into the back of the truck. Quickly the fireworks settle into a terrible sameness the way a swarm of connotations settles in, once you know what it's supposed to mean. In the dream, where do I find it Being a village ((explainer,)) I'm always happy to come upon a village It's an old bus that travelled between these small farm towns so far apart that I disembark just to run into the store and fetch something to fix the zipper on the shoulder bag. But all my suitcases slow me down When I get back outside it's long gone, another not due for days Often the dream dissolves instantly as I stumble through the alarm clock and light switch. leaving behind as a residue an emotional tone. I was being threatened, or there was a puzzle to solve, or I've been abandoned by a bus One difference with waking is that in dream I see clearly, sharply. I'm never wearing glasses. The one word I remember is {lipsmack} Chadwick. It's not the details themselves that are difficult. We're staring off into an amber horizon, trying to foretell the weather. Is a hurricane coming? Alongside three steamer trunks each of which contains three bad guys, unconscious clad only in their skivvies. Then I wake up, a Roy Orbison song obsessively in my head But the linkages between them offer no sensible verb  Suppress the ((impulse)) to name that tune The two other people trapped in the elevator are a young man who's been in bed four days with the flu and an older woman who's a receptionist in a doctor's office somewhere in the building What spider could've spun a web so thick, so ((filmy)), so strong. The first ((horizon)) of a sore throat first burst of light occurs over the kit- # over the bathroom sink, ((as)) absorbed, refracted, swelling into the eye Wind bends the brambles between the fence and the shed a sound more like scraping than rustling, as a train whistle hoots somewhere to the west A solution thick as honey is poured into the eye. Then the plaster cylinder inserted, standing upright in his face without actually touching the surface. A woman I haven't seen in fifteen years ((and)) haven't thought of in ten, a misshapen thing who wrought havoc in our political collective until we expelled her without, I believe, her even comprehending that that's what ((we've)) done, returns in the dream as officious and anxious as ever Lingonberry cheesecake right before bed enhances the effect	Subject
