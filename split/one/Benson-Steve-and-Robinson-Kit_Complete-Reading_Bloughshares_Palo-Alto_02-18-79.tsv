Benson-Steve-and-Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Bloughshares_Palo-Alto_02-18-79	0.182	521.834	The green canoe like bee- beef tasted salty for days after strong hat waves, waves motorcycles have anti ravaged, the western basins of the great Continental chain into pitch darkness, the stairs twisted and ((taut)) back all one hundred lights. Red filters bobbing above what I suppose light fog to be ((And code)) um You don't have any punctuation, but of course it was there when you read, ((the)) punctuation was very emphatic ((Uh-huh.)) Huh. And I= I just wondered whether ((wh- wh- wh-)) # you know Why that is. Yeah. Well, the thing is, I think I'm sort of # ((well)) when I read it I feel like I have to improvise it uh almost like I have to make it up. And I might read it another time and the punctuation might be completely different Yeah. Because most of those lines are linking both forward and back and so you have to decide when you're reading it to close it at a certain point and then to reopen it. But I think all those things are= are fairly # are variable, or a lot of them are. ((Yeah.)) You think ((that could)) imply that another ((type #)) ((Yeah,)) I see. Yeah. {cough} ((That's fascinating.)) So I can be interrupted at any moment and uh the= the books, you can browse at them ((now.)) There's a couple ((poem I like here. {laugh})) And s- so for me this book is uh a lot of the writing that I've been doing in the last couple years It's a little bit before then and I want to read three poems now. She Fall Down and Go Boom The bridge seems too far down to take it I can't take it, my mind is going The funeral is so tacky We all go out to dinner and leave her the corner of the house A license plate with a word spelled out braids. A place we went on our date. We look out the window and eagerly feed our eyes against the landscape the woods soar from rain mess and structure I signed my John Hancock I look in the barn for an umbrella the rain outside the wind rising and peering ((He)) uses her pinafores to sweep Nothing helps me decide. The weekenders arrive. Nobody sleeps in the same bed We remind ourselves of thoughts and dreams We remind ourselves I can live with that, he says I reflect on myself, then We walk, locked arm in arm We are out the door, then A license plate with the words spelled out Nobody sleeps in the same bed Breakfast is boring and untidy We remind ourselves of thoughts and dreams I feel absurd in this makeup We remind ourselves nothing backwards is anything and everything I can live with that, he says The fool, I think to myself I reflect on myself, then Is nothing better We walk locked arm in arm We are out the door then. The Games The bridge seems nothing, low bridge A bad case says my mind is going Crying and shivering remind our wisdom teeth out a license plate with a boring ((coke)) A place we weekenders eagerly fed our eyes The buyers keep my hat on structure The woods ((used skirts)) lost in the woods I signing my look into the barn for hearing The rain lives out the side I look around the bruised against on the subway A high wind in the same bed We remind ourselves, Go out to dinner and leave in this makeup Nothing backwards is the formula, ((even)) with that The fool, I think down and go on myself then We walk locked out the door then Is tide too far down to make it He can't take it, my mind is bronchitis We had our teeth in a corner Breakfast is into a bar and asks for a word spelled out The weekenders ((over)) # out the window went on dates I keep my hat on buying with mess about rising prices ~E uses her skirts to sit lost in the ((sore)) from rain I look into the barn for rising John Hancock We live out helps me decide Eyes get lost on the place to buy beer A corner of the ((sleeks)) and the ((causes thoughts roll)) We all go feel absurd in thoughts and dreams The formula is eating anything and everything She fall down and gone, I think to myself out the door walk locked arm in High tide, low bridge seems better I can't take it, my case of sense The time we had our wisdom shivering in ourselves We walked in and asked for a plate with the word spelled boring and untidy Looked and fed we went on, awry Elements and ((fires)) soar about rising in the doorway A weasel sits lost in the woods, sore from using her skirts to sweet The wind rising and signing an umbrella Nothing helps rain live out the day We get lost on the look around the corner for a place to buy the landscape Nobody sleeps in the thoughts of the house I feel absurd in cells and ((I'll)) go out and leave her I can live as ((anything up)) I reflect on myself. I think to go boom We are the door locked arm in arm um I had decided not to read this ((uh=)) uh I just changed my mind There was sort of a companion piece with it which I don't have This is pretty short and it's a little essay. It's sort of an attempt at the essay form but I think it must've been written by one of those methods because It's sort of uh discontinuous in a way but I guess it was written in the context of thinking about writing and thinking about writing about writing and so that ((s-)) seems to be what it's about And ((the)) title is Either The letters are at hand the sounds look it lines right across the brow Things want to go into pairs then a propped up tier and it goes out, staying in the city for this time period Very different people wait listen to talk the whole time without one knot in their Monday morning hair Fortunately one year everything and the next year, they're naming it. Well, that's correct At some point when there are other people around, nobody's going to be there In shadow, the shadow doesn't show I just stuffed myself into it That kind of situation is like the key. It makes me laugh Where it all takes place the year is displaced, heard faintly from a room The limits ((wrought)) to bear from an early as well as an earlier age are defined only negatively by a positive assertion of self's acts (({laugh} I love that line.)) (({breath})) How to enter on ((dream)) stage, lines down, at least as many voices as there are Eyes for years on both sides, wide open, so to speak. Jet noise knocked with standing, sudden outbursts of foolish inflated waves. It's the American way to come down hard with a thump	Subject
