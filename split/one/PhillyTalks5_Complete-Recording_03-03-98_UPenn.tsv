I find very few writers who are able to do this and I got permission or instruction, you know permission in the sense of= of Duncan's permission to= to enter a meadow through the work of= of uh # through the wonderful work of Etel Adnan the Lebanese uh writer who as she says u- uh now wr- writes in English and paints in Arabic {NSV} u- um because essentially she grew up without a language {laugh} or with many languages. um These are things that can be seen as advantages or disadvantages depending on how you look at it. Growing up in a colonial atmosphere with displaced parents who had several languages which were not the dominant languages, et cetera et cetera. She ended up writing in English and somehow placed herself in American English but brought in all of this experience and to me that was something that was very instructive um and something that= that allowed me to try to think about ways in which places could be themselves and not at the same time because I think there's a privilege given to place which I have tried to somehow contest at the same time as I invite it and embrace it um So where I am exactly in all of that is= is extremely difficult. I mean I # there have been n- number of years in which I've simply worked in translation because I didn't know where I was in terms of where I would begin my language. That's it. Yeah, ((I don't see #)) that- that's= that's good I mean its a good answer um How about if we read a little bit? and then open it up to discussion would that work. Yeah? Can I ask a question first? You certainly may. um So I just scream it ((at her)) No, just # I'll repeat it. Speak it uh Okay. um I'm actually # this is such a simple question. I'm just wondering what you heard that made you say that's my voice Oh, well I didn't # I don't # uh a- are you asking that of me or of him? I'm asking you, yeah. uh ((Answer)) to the # ((a)) question about the answer that you gave before that uh Oh, okay. ((Yeah.)) Yeah. ((the name too, it's)) y- Yeah. um Right, well v- voice is a word that is so burdened with theoretical quasi theoretical poetic qu- quasi p- poetic overtones that # I= I did use # there was a specific word I used when I described this before, but I think I want to back up and= and try and say that a little differently because uh it c- # the idea of voice can very easily be confused with the idea of a person or poet having a voice which is= a= w- is a way to ((eliminate)) talking about that person's w- work and style and method and ((hm)) the results thereof and so forth, rather # um pretty much or at least in my view or for me ((people that.)) So uh what the wq- # so in a way the question is, What did I hear and was it a sound y- you know, because the first thing it was was a sound it was a sound of a thought, of a way of thinking, okay? So the phrase that I used that you heard me read at the end of um Absence Sensorium, We will crush the arrogant kingdom in our days, that's right from the liturgy uh ((that)) essentially is um and there are actually {laugh} many other in what # in that that= that are a way of my trying to bring forward a ((liturgy.)) Now the liturgy would # I'm going to take two minutes on this. The liturgy is= is actually a r- # a= a= a place where it's a # an anthology. The liturgy is an anth- # the= the liturgy that is the standard liturgy+ of of the tradition I grew up in which essentially is conservative Judaism and # uh w- which means Orthodox Jewish liturgy, translation okay uh is a residue of the rabbis around the uh turn of the Common Era, round # of the first few centuries. That's what it # what # and= and then again, another layer from the= uh the saf- the Safed Kabbalah, especially around the s- the Sabbath. All the liturgy around the Sabbath is from # a lot of it is from the sixteenth century from the town of Safed where a lot of Iberian Jews wound up and there was a really sort of very intense m- uh mystical and Messianic body of thought that finds itself # its way into that. So what I was hearing, I didn't know that, actually at that # I mean the point at which I heard these sounds, I did not know what this stuff was. I didn't understand I was hearing history, or people, individuals, or an anthology. So for me what I heard w- was a sound that sounded like the way I would think And then when I went and started to ((g-)) # look into it, and ((uh)) by no means am I a scholar and I don't like to pass myself off as one. I'm not, you know um ((uh)) thankfully, which means # that means I ((could)) stop reading it when I {laugh} feel like it. ((I know that)) # yeah. uh {NSV} If you know what I mean, I don't # have not # I don't have the responsibility to be a scholar. So um but that's what it meant. What it meant for me was to act- # what it turned out to mean for me was to actually hear a group a bunch a= a succession of people wh- whose individual intellectual work in ((well)) poetry because all intellectual work in that group of people, in that historical group was poured into this. ((I mean in)) other words, they= weren't= they weren't doing {laugh} science. They weren't # you know they weren't actually writing uh quote unquote secular literary works so that this work that they did that uh w- was colle- # is collected in midra- # in the Midrashim, in the Talmud and so forth, is all of their # all impulses of thought poured into a single vessel, which makes it extremely rich, at least for me. So uh Just to # yeah, to= a- to add to that um, there's a phrase some of you may be familiar with. The uh= uh # Nathaniel Mackey's phrase of uh, Music is wounded kinship's last resort uh which is something that I've come back to again and again, and it's I think an amplification of an idea that	Subject
