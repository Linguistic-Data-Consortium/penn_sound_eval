Sherlock-Frank_and_Savich-Zach_Complete-Reading_WWFLI_KWH-UPenn_9-18-13	0.39	400.28	Each of the ((honor)) boxes featured Eric's portrait work expressing a bit of each person's story. The user friendly exhibit was installed on street corners along South Ninth Street and East Passyunk Avenue and between Carpenter and Twelfth Streets. So the uh seven figures  give a thumbnail sketch. Father Antonio I- Isoleri was an Italian immigrant who became pastor of the first Italian parish in the United States. Saint Mar- Mary Magdalene dePazzi. His service as a spiritual and secular leader from eighteen seventy to nineteen twenty six was instrumental in shaping the future of South Philadelphia's Italian-American community. The church remains a worship site while maintaining its Italian identity to this day. Its former rectory serves as the Mario Lanza Institute and Museum, honoring the tenor who used to sing the Ave Maria in his old church. Dorothy Allen is the daughter of West Indian African American parents and was born and raised in South Philadelphia. She is the founder of the Barrett Educational Center in Point Breeze and worked to provide food, social services,  job training, and a safe haven for children and teens in the neighborhood. African Americans have formed part of the South Philadelphia community since the area's earliest days. By eighteen twenty the area around South Street contained nearly three quarters of Philadelphia's African American population. Many newcomers settled west of Broad Street in Point Breeze during the Great Migration of the twentieth century. Bill McIntyre was a longshoreman and a master welder for the Independent Pier Company. He marched as a comic in the Mummers Parade for many years before founding the Shooting Stars Fancy Brigade. The parade's first Fancy Brigade. He paraded with his neighbors on New Year's Day for seventy three years. The parade traces back to mid-seventeenth century roots. The New Year's traditions of South Philadelphia's first settlers, the Swedes, blended with the traditional Mummers play of the British Isles. After more than a century of informal merrymaking, the first official parade was in nineteen oh one. ((Fabula Conto)) works as an accountant for Marriott Hotels. She helps organize Philadelphia's version of Guadalupe celebration. She was also an active participant in negotiations to increase communication between the Philadelphia police and South Philadelphia's Mexican community. This community established around the Italian Market and is mainly from the state of Puebla. The Mexican population in South Philly has grown exponentially since two thousand and one. This is due in part to migration from New York City in the wake of the September eleventh attacks. Frank ((Snock)) was the son of Polish immigrants. In the early+ twentieth century he boxed under the name Johnny ((Coffey.)) The young fighter made enough money to open Snockey's Oyster House, A neighborhood landmark that has thrived over a hundred years and counting. During the greatest influx of European immigration into Philadelphia, the Washington Avenue wharves were owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. {lipsmack} They served as a docking point for ships to unload food, finished goods, workers, and future Americans that would travel by train through the city and around the country. ((Ba Win)) is a Vietnamese refugee and a respected elder in South Philadelphia's Southeast Asian community. Active member as a volunteer, she teaches traditional Vietnamese cooking classes to young people and promotes health screenings for aging immigrants. South Philadelphia's been one of the chief destinations for the Vietnamese immigration in the ~USA since nineteen seventy five. Philadelphia has a higher percentage and numerical population of Vietnamese than New York City. Joe Tayoun's Lebanese immigrant grandparents established the family's roots in South Philly where they opened the legendary Middle East restaurant. An accomplished percussionist who learned his musical craft while working in his family business, Joe has performed across the United States, Europe, and North Africa. The Lebanese community in South Philadelphia dates back to the eighteen eighties. Father Istfan Korkemaz established Saint Maron's, the United States' first Maronite church in nineteen century, being eighteen s- eighty seven. It's located at Tenth and Ellsworth since nineteen oh one. That's why I got confused. And it continues to play a vital role in the r- # lives of Philadelphia's Lebanese American community. So that's the background. And whenever {cough} we feel like is a feel good event, so you can feel good about paintings that speak with their eyes. Feel good about Rome, even though it's far, far away. The Bangladesh agreement is something we can agree to feel good about. You can feel a poet as priest slash priest as poet. Feel good about smiles at the gates of heaven and Garibaldi as well. Feel good about the ballad of Antonio Isoleri. The icon's eyes have moved to guide a young man into spirit. To direct the poet from the smile of God, and give a new father a mission. I am crossing alps and ocean. Philadelphia awaits. La Superba falls from view, from the parish windows around him. This new world is a world of faith in what there is to become. What is to become of Montrose Street but to be built as a beam between cultures. The church's saint, a mystical nun. Her pastor a temporal shepherd. On the feast day her doors open to railroad workers walking the picket for justice. On Sunday he rails against exploiting our children as slaves. You can still hear echoing whispers. ((Patria unita)) under tricolor. ((unita via)) (()) Calabria, Sicily, Abruzzo, Molise, ((unita)) before him in marriage.	Speaker1
