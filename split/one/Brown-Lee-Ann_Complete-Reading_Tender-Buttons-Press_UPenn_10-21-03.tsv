In fact, I was obsessing on what would be in the big birthday book. You almost made the day of eccentricity along with (()), but you pass that over for the day of abandon, total freedom. Same sign as Sinead O'Connor, Mary Queen of Scots, Jim Morrison, Flip Wilson, alter ego, Geraldine, whom your grandmother of the same name was purpor- purported to have loved and others of wild nature unable to be contained. You were also born in the year of the horse and as a Sagittarius, you are a double horsey ready to run and  travel free. But I hope you'll stick close by me for a while because I love it. And even though last month, you're supposedly finally figured out we are separate bodies and identities, you were own self from the beginning of focused, discerning light, so calm for a baby. You did cry, though not as often as most we hear and you did not have that collar or colic, but any of the # but are of the undeniably sweet dis- disposition. Anyway, as I was saying, I love you close by me. And when we= we are together in bed, you nursing in the crook of my arm, I can imagine you are still attached to me as you were in the inside and your fine smooth body, exceptionally fat, fair and pure is covered with fine patina of sweat. It is like you are still swimming in me. One time when you were kicking up a storm so strong in Vienna when I was walking one night to catch the tram to meet your father, you kicked such a complex rhythm that I had to stop walking in order to process the polyphony. I noticed these couplets line are growing longer and longer. It's because I have so much to say to you and the headlong rush seems the way to go if I am to attempt to catch up in all the varied strands of thought and experience that have transpired since your birth, making everything richer and more layered. I even had the feeling yesterday that you had always been here, even though you've only been outside a little over half a year. Maybe you were always there in eternity or infinity. You met destiny on the street the other day and I said destiny, meet reality and reality, meet destiny. And Destiny's mother laughed and told her friend how I looked around when she was calling out down Eighth Avenue. Destiny. Destiny. So many little happenings since you were born. And before now that art and life seem even more enmeshed. I think I'll go take a swim with you and your dad now in the ~L shaped pool with you and your bright pink swim diapers given to us unused by Stella. So many lovely hand me downs and new things too. (({laugh})). Had to work up to that one. ((I)) # I'll= just= I'll just do like a few from this. And um uh India's going to read some of the three fifteen project that she worked on. I wanted to read um a piece of mine. It's= a= it's an interesting um project that # Bernadette Mayer is another ins- inspiration to= to us that um ((Laney)) referenced earlier. And she's also a way that Stein comes into this generation. She taught us a lot about um Gertrude Stein's sort of conceptual um you know, ideas with the sentence and her play. um But the # this definitions of the # the three fifteen project is a bunch of people writing every August at three fifteen in the morning. And it's going on for like, what, eight years or so? Eight, ten years. I did it the very first year. I think it was ninety three, or something like that. um So if you ever want to join it, there's a website I think you can join up to do the three fifteen project. But I # this is the only thing I saved from this book out of that. And then the whole thing was published in their place, but um this is definitions at three fifteen. Poetry, a condensed form of food and time. Voice, my speech, babe. Brain, a rain in ((~B)). Boat, ((toy bot, a ted debt)). Solitude, sun in a squeegee. Modesty, the ruined package. Discourse, talking fancy without much= much to drink. And I'll just do um very short sample from this new book. um Oh, before I forget, the Tinder Buttons books that are here tonight, um India's and Laney's, I ((wanted)) you know, if you want to pick them up or get # give a special deal tonight. So please, um usually like eleven ninety five, we'll give two for ten bucks or seven each if you want just one. So, um want to say that before I forget {laugh}. Because we have uh # we brought them down from New York when you had to take them home with you and put them on your bedside. Another thing I like about um um you know, Laney's work is the um work with the botanical language. The= the language of flowers and= and of seeds and botany and science. And I= I did a lot of work with that. And then, um of course I was attracted to India's um work with sleep as a sort of transformative state. um And (()) # we both use those in our works. So I think that's one of the common threads and I want to read two poems that sort of link up with that. So um Encyclopedia Botanica. Or # this is sort of a title of my book # or a mother to be's book of meltdown, anticipation, and scientific renderings of organic and theoretical forms such as the way flowers lie in the bud. A permutational (()) of (()), consisting of painful insufflations, multiple (()). The calculus of various inflorescence. My na√Øve set theories as unordered pairs, vibratory odes in all manner of cross pollinating color, illumined spores and how they grow in corkscrew contortion  all imbued with entire new electric libraries of the body. Herein find random factors of the strange attraction to hard science, but also to soften it. Previously failed materials and pick up works. Illuminated maps of misreading. Specifically a trace study of my own peculiar vocabulary living in the dictionary.	Subject
