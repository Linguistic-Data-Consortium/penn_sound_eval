Was it that I'd gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months? That I needed no one else? An older woman, a second cousin, took me in hand, but I was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me. Whatever our ((bodies)) were up to. Meanwhile, I kept a close watch on that ladder activity, thinking how now I would be able to satisfy Hilda when next we met. The knowledge, however acquired, is power. I must confess my feelings towards Hilda were not unmixed. At times I would decide to banish her ((for)) she deserved nothing else. But then I would see that she was already banished, and that I would have to think of something else. Well, the first thing I had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches. That's another story. A story all in itself and one, really, very much like this. So I don't have to tell it here. A year had passed and Hilda had grown some four or five inches so that she was now six feet tall. Her wrists, which had been ((long)) with a kind of vulnerability I found very attractive, were now bony as though she'd been hung from a beam. Her face, deprived of its previous bloom, was long and sallow. In short, I thought her ugly. Pitifully so, although when she spoke the voice was the same and I was glad to feel the pain of that survival. Her place was by no means the palace she had caused me to infer she came from. I had to spend the night on a couch in the living room but by now I knew this kind of evasion of the realities of one's circumstance was widespread and I'd even begun to slip into it myself. Next day when her parents were at work, Hilda, who had taken the morning off, sat with me in the kitchen while her boyfriend raced his motorbike up and down the block, looking up at the window from time to time, sneakily. I caught his glance once when I was looking down. How Hilda must have felt. She had returned to a different perspective, and now here I was, the living proof of a will she wouldn't be likely to meet many more times in the corner she had settled for. For it was clear to me now that all was over between us. Listening to her talk I began to despise the person I had been the year before. Still, I had the will to stay, but the will to leave under those circumstances offered more possibilities and so I bowed gracefully to the inevitable. When I got up to go, tears did come to her eyes. That moment I remember still and I recognized immediately a feeling to be stored up against the ease, if not the indifference, of times to come. Many times in the future I was to conjure that farewell when I was filled with despair and often it sufficed to tip the balance so that it could be thought to have caused several destructive rages over the years. But it's all water under the bridge now. Hardly worth the trouble of telling and it's past time already to think that I have told it poorly and to see that, like it or not, there's nothing I can do about that either. Yes, it might have all been otherwise and yet for what it has to say about the human will in one of its manifestations, I wouldn't change one moment of the misery. For an easier way is not necessarily a better. and I believe I can speak not only for myself, but for Hilda, who found out what it was like to meet her match. A man who scorned to take either no or yes for an answer. ((Okay.)) Now th- these are a series of short pieces with a general title of tight corners {cough} Have I been reading about twenty five minutes? Feels like it. What's the time? Yeah I have Okay. I'll= read= I'll read for about ten minutes more. The boy, elbows bent, supports himself with his hands. His body prone so that his face may approach the surface of this small pond from which he drinks. At his back the lane goes on and the sheep go with it. The black dog at their back, possibly a reminder of the artist or one's self. Further on, one wants to say, though in another sense it's higher up, the lane crooks out of the shade and finds an open meadow from where there must be a better view of that squat church tower. But the clouds, the clouds are more surely the point. Such clouds as are no longer to be seen. A rhythm of contraction would pull one in, deeper into itself, before that open space. Meadow and sky is granted one. These are very loosely sequential and uh it's= it's happiest for me if I just uh make up a different way through it each time. So. The pause is only while ((the eye selects)) something to do. While they watch the cat, while they watch (({laugh})) While they watch, the cat stalks up the path to the front door, raises itself by putting its front paws as high as it can reach against the door and then, resting on its left forefoot, it raises its right so that the knocker is moved out until the arc of the paw falls below the arc the knocker makes and thus the knocker falls back against the metal inset in the door and as they watch, the door opens and the cat slips in as a woman's face appears peering into the street. The two men have been walking for a long time, one thinks though perhaps no more than an hour. It's now becoming obvious that he has chosen the less traveled of two highways out of town in the direction he and his friend want to go. His friend was right, and he was wrong. They resolve to take the cutoff they are now approaching, and to walk its length, if no farm truck comes along, until the other highway is reached. The heat is considerable. It is early afternoon. On either hand huge fields of wheat find no wind to stir them. The only food they have is a chocolate bar. The time comes to eat it, and one unslings the pack and they take it out.	Speaker1
