Ginsberg-Allen_Complete-Reading_WCW-Lecture_3-17-88	0.211	951.689	((Tiresius like)) softness and delicacy ((in um)) ((Claire)) quite questioned the inquiry of ((the)) ((missing bottom)) It resulted in that little high ((warbling)) voice that some people have, you know older folks there Old school teacher ladies or old school teacher men ((uh)) I don't know, ((you)) might describe as something that's Oh, I see ((with the way you)) horrible here he is, you know nineteen twenty eight ((Nice)) uh one period continue the great laws ((this is when he decided. What=)) what is he saying? That love was never made for man and woman to ((crack the cleanup)) so he loves and loves his sons and loves his ((Ecclesias.)) But there is a great law over him which that it is as it is, the wind blowing, the mud spots on the fallen surface the face reflected in the glass which as you advance, the features disappear leaving only the hat ((as you draw back, features return)) Tip of the nose, the projection over the eyebrows, the cheekbones and the bulge of the lips, and the chin last Yeah, uh-huh. {laugh} it's ((a)) ((real)) ((So= so)) he was playing tricks with his mind all the time Yes. {NSV} uh Yeah, it really puts tricks on you with perception ((Ellison)) And so that would give it tremendous depth, uh whereas everybody else is walking around in a world already solid ((Right)) he's dissolving with all his like conceptual uh= uh subtleties Yeah. and then try to write them down. Yeah. I'll make a big serious portrait ((of)) my time. Yeah. ((This is twenty two,)) yeah. So to continue the anecdotal aspect of this um see, I had a uh # I did an interview, did # wrote the interview up I get the n- # the only things I remember were ((I take your eye)) and ((the eye of a doctor)) He answered my ((questions,)) do you consider yourself a doctor or a poet and um ((sect)) that he wrote on ((any time)) Huh. and ((in= be-)) in between patients he would # he had a thought. ((He met)) interesting patients and so he had a waiting room with the patients coming in and out and he was always ((ready)) And I wrote it up ((and)) the guys from the labor ha- # labor the uh Patterson Press edited it and chopped it up so it was very insulting {laugh} God. {breath} (()) So, ((you'd go)) I wrote up something that was flattering, I thought. And they cut it and rewrote it And so ((I)) was ((ashamed)) to send it to him but it was a full page long I'll have to go find it again. ((I need to see what they did to it)) {laugh} ((Okay.)) But I still didn't quite understand what he was up to. ((Didn't=)) didn't get it ((No.)) and then that same year she gave a reading at the Museum of Modern Art, in nineteen forty eight ((This is where you're coming with Patterson, huh? Tell them you're a Luddite.)) Yeah. So I went to see him at the museum and he read uh ((let's see)) think he read the uh Pure Products of America Go Crazy. ((you know, and as to that immediately)) ((No.)) but the one that really got me that I guess unlocked it all was The Clouds Oh, right. ((Yeah,)) yeah. You know The= end= the end line ((at)) the end of the # ((and)) we have that here Let me see if I've got it here ((I don't think so)) uh the= last= the last verse of the last page in the (()) ((There's a no name with a probably fantasy justification)) Yeah Let's see what I got there. No, I don't have that here. Do you have that around ((at all?)) ((No, I don't have this kind here. It's part of this later # no, it's= it's in a before # it was published by um {lipsmack} coming to press after the ledge)) Probably. Well ((apis- apis- Apismyra ~A comma uh this # the last one)) yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah, uh the last one when he was on the stage at the Museum ((of)) Modern Art and giving his ((regular)) reading. And it's a poem about the United Nations I # which I was construing as, You've got to bring your imagination down to the ground and ground yourself, so to speak. Otherwise you get um ((uh any kind of uh)) fantasy monsters= monsters of reason, monsters of imagination, uh irrelevancies plunging the imagination, plunging ((on a)) butterfly. ((He's mired on Mothra.)) That's the way it ends And he ended it, but he ended it with this gesture of butterfly, ((a pismire Mothra)) ((Oh, okay.)) ((Certainly)) And I said, Oh, I see. He's just talking {laugh} {laugh} ((Yes.)) This poetry's no different from somebody actually talking for real And the reason I hadn't been able to read him is that my father's poetry and all the poetry I'd ever read was supposed to be somebody talking not for real, or a different style than real conversation ((It's like if he)) reads a sonnet or it's a literary sound or it's= a= it's a pun or on uh somebody else's poem or it has some stale wash of another poem over it. But this was just absolute straightforward uh well uh conversation I guess or declaration or speech. But the poetry was identical with intense fragments of spoken idiom, as you might hear at ((Marseille)) himself. And that was the first time I'd ever heard of such a notion, that the poetry could be real or that realit- # that it could be somebody talking for real, instead of making up a poem like or making up uh # making it up to look good. And I don't know what it was that uh I could- # I don't know how ((uh)) # if I could even you know describe what my idea of poetry was before ((I said I)) was supposed it. ((I)) didn't, ((because I)) just never thought it out. But it had never occurred to me that could be identical with actual speech {lipsmack} and once I understood that, then I could start reading them. And I began reading ((it and=)) and that really blew my mind then After that, he ((I think was # he read)) let's see uh= uh Pure Products of America Go Crazy and that was very moving Yeah. because I fin- finally understood ((that it was nifty. I thought that I could put the accent in this other style)) ((and we degraded per his destiny about how hunger can feed itself)) And then the interesting thing was when he had to make an imagination of Heaven or what he desired, it was a real down to earth # ((it's)) a very common, while he # while the # Imagination is strange enough that it feels overwrought and stifling and ((some kind)) strange # with deer going # ((everything is)) strange after deer going by and ((fields were stuck with this= this)) goldenrod ((and the stifling)) Stifling ((he would sometimes # somehow it seems to his stride)) Yeah. No one to witness and adjust, no one to drive a car. {NSV} Witness and adjust. ((That's right)) So ((Now)) uh Once i- once I got the idea that he was talking for real and then he said something as straightforward uh as uh that we got to eat shit, I mean ((w- uh what he was saying)) that the way we are living, it's like we're eating shit instead of uh Yeah. instead of our desire ((to seem #)) ((That's to the hunger, too.)) yeah. uh ((Notes)) that seems really radical to me and amazing that anybody would be saying anything so interior and frank and uh realistic just like you'd think to yourself when you're alone in bed at night and um somehow, that turned # that changed # ((it)) turned me around completely as far as what poetry was supposed to be because before that I'd been writing ((rhymed)) verse imitating uh ((Sir Thomas Wyatt, that poet.)) ((I assume that's sensing, your office, calves and those)) It's not simply a depressed state of mind but it's a sense that the um that the resources of the terminations of the  common world, the have really been dis- {laugh} disappointing to put it mildly in the sense that they used to uh (({cough})) uh nothing more than hope to use to= to= to= to either act ((to=)) to= to= to= to re- to # fact and or hope might've # might # might've proven the case uh ((Chris Weetabix has been talking uh)) the group of uh # not that if a younger, a bit of undergraduate class rehearsing the= the political events of the last # of yesterday, particularly and then disposition for example Alan uh had a piece from the Boston Globe which has been doing a an intensive {lipsmack} investigatory business on the uh uh sources of information ((of)) the ~FBI and the ~FBI had= had obviously bee- # had pulled back from uh using its own people and covered uh= uh= uh illegal uh= uh information. ((This is it.)) And apparently it's got a whole sort of uh almost one wants to say a subculture of uh eager beavers and voluntary uh= uh= uh people # Vigilante, ((yeah.)) yeah. Vigilante groups that are practically doing the same uh investigations ((aforementioned uh)) all= all illegal but not constituting uh you know ((federal developments of common agency)) ((Funny.)) Anyhow we're talking about ((this book and this,)) I'm talking about the Sandinistas and could one think of it as simply good guys versus bad guys ((and)) Alan had seen ((them repeating in the s- # in the # on the= b- the bathroom uh just uh moments ago that said, If= you=)) if you like uh Cuba you'll really {laugh} love Nicaragua. {laugh} Saying that uh you know, would that # the {laugh} Nicaraguan government were= were simply sweetness and {laugh} light, just ((yeah.)) But in fact it is a very # you know, it's= a= it's= a= it's a very uh one= one party government with very determined attitudes and= and very real senses of= uh of social conduct being you know {laugh} For= the {laugh} for the pro or con # or against it, so that the # Very with you or against you ((is their thinking.)) Yeah, really= really very ((determining of certain conflicts, instead of a sort of now that I think other)) thinking of the Israeli ((college uh standing in business.)) But I was thinking it's bleak indeed these days. It was obviously bleak in Williams's time equally, to think of what you could propose as a viable and uh ((consequent world for these imaginations and or the practical violence up and beyond two hundred words forever)) {lipsmack} ((I felt that ending. One time I'd fallen for that, with two visits)) that the world was not a better {laugh} place, ((just felt it. Yeah, I felt it, I felt uh the need for the # me and his fears of {laugh} nothing)) ((That)) what he said? Really? fuck things up. He didn't use that {laugh} expression, but that was the Uh-huh. Yeah, uh That was mid fifties? That= was= that was the mid fifties (()) Well, he'd been sympathetic to Communism a little, ((I'd bet, huh?)) Yeah. Well, let's think of it in ((green brusher, I'm thinking.)) Yeah. ((Good.)) ((You want to be married, your marriage uh)) Yeah, or to paint church as a ((punishment)) Yeah. ((when she's got the monies, doesn't say paint without= the=)) ((without the relationship with the)) Uh-huh. ((uh yeah, because)) yeah, this is the time when he writes that poem because I think it's # I remember it being published in the late forties the forties and I think he ((had something)) in ((his)) fifties It was a chap book that Richard ((Words)) Embassy published called The Pink Church and this was a time when the whole ((defamation)) of fellow travelers and pinkos Mhm. was very active and ((you call- you called people candidates, so you'd parody writing)) a poem called Pink Church Right. Especially when he said, ((And)) come all you Communist ((so and so amateur)) drunks and surrealists, you know uh ((What hasn't come, is there something there?)) It said the answer was, And Milton's singing among the rest ((by the Communists)) Right. Yeah. Milton ((Leanne Rymes are singing among the rest of the Congress)) Mhm. ((and)) {breath} um it's an incredible ((turn of poem.)) The Pink Church is literally a ((a woman's grass, you know.)) Grass, yeah. um But it's uh yeah, he certainly had. But then his good friend Fred Miller was= was specifically uh # he was specifically Marxist and Uh-huh. there's alway some person in a relationship with this, ((as Mike Lieber'd usually go point out)) ((was)) crucial to him as= a= as= a= as a uh {lipsmack} as a sidekick, not= as= a= not= a- not as a gofer Mhm. as someone who he ((uh)) almost works through to Mhm. to= get= uh to get ((us the ground)) much as ((Mick Almond has, when)) Mhm. ((his anger that McDonalds, the place was taken away from him by ~HD and crying, after this, I think)) ((you know)) I have to see ((about this,)) if I remember any of ((it.)) There are a couple other little things I remember from other visits Yeah, here. ((Let's see)) One was, what was his fight with ~T ~S Eliot Yeah. uh He went to a local poetry society like uh the ((Rammofolk)) County Poetry Society at their invitation at somebody's private house. So he took me along because we had a ((wiener date)) and he said, Would you like to go there So {lipsmack} it was just a little ((trying)) # it was a small uh poetry circle from the local ((Jersey retro scene)) And I asked # uh first I asked # ((I)) was asking him, for a long poem, what kind of rhy- # or rhythm, what kind of rhythm or what kind of uh first line # Yeah. what kind of measure is a long poem? And he said, All different kinds. That's ((helpful)) Was sort of like in ((Pound)) or in uh more like uh # he did it, what he did in ((Patterson)) and what he was doing then in ((Patterson.)) ((Climate,)) yeah. ((It was uh also his)) which was some rhyme, some prose some (()) lines, some short, short lines, balance but he was ((saying)) for a long poem in the twentieth century uh= uh= uh a great number of different first forms ((um)) bro- uh broken up ((uh)) you know you're broken ((for lies up within the)) the uh ((m-)) monotonous uh single ((first)) line then I said, What is it uh # wh- why don't you like the ((azaleas?)) What is it, because he had said he said he'd written ((a night,)) he'd said that again to me that uh Eliot was such a genius that he'd set ((up all)) American poetry back twenty years. ((I said what #)) what'd you mean by that? {cough} And he said, That bastard ((That's something)) that # no, that son of a bitch. He was really angry at him. Said, Any time I have something contemporary that son of a bitch, I met him and we would # we met uh f- few years ago or something at some occasion and Eliot came over to him and # or= or they were introduced to me. Eliot said, Oh, Doctor Williams I do so admire your characters. Let's have more of them {laugh} Oh, God. {laugh} That would kill me ((What's)) characters? Characters meaning you like the characters that have the ((royal #)) little Yeah. uh descriptions of people like the um Portrait of a Lady Yeah. You know the Eliot ((uh)) Portrait of a Lady No. or uh Madame Sosostris or whatever. So, I do so admire your characters. Let's have more of them. And Williams said, He was so condescending {laugh} Without knowing ((anyone)) and presumptuous ((Yeah.)) and uh= uh he deliberately using the= the= the # all that English stylistics on me when he knew what my interests were that= that= uh that he wanted to put my little # my poems into the category um Johnsonian character- Johnsonian ((um uh))	Subject
