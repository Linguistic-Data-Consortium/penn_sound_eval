((Still)) blade hold changed incomprehensibly. ((Late)) within and hidden by the circle. The vow. Where (()) thought this felt upon hand ((~E)) of the handmaiden ((ghosts)) which fathomed ((blinked)) and bothered no more. Thus she begins. ((Were)) soothsayer. Say little said.  Little say sooth ((sod)) or meaning to rewrite perplexity. Possibly sworn such the further fathoms of fabric swung so possibly sleep so possibly deporting the dangers of small fish placed accordingly in our pockets, we set out and nowhere beginning tapestries. Early morning dedications a (()) Weather maps broken. The relaxing figure draws a windowpane easily with death. Blue finger. The glass trembles. Body tangled in ivy of the interrupted moment returns, embeds itself in skin. (()) Put the rock crystal in the sun and put the warm crystal on your eyes. If they are blurry. The rock crystal illuminates the malicious fluids of unshed tears. Its natural art originates from water. Light in my eyes ((pleads)) the (()) lest I sleep. Interlude. I dress my vowels oddly. Peaks covered with garments of birch. Simplicity is an even fitting. A diagram of snow to define white. Not trembling linen maiden. No pleaded coif inherited but one deliberately unbound. Shall I separate even now? Gold from circlet. Interior from chamber. Speech requires an opaque mistress whose steps appear mineral. A winter song closeted by ((stays.)) Sentencing. There is more waiting than one thought possible began the female sentence. But how then must one proceed. Simply, replied the pear. One proceeds, one need not wait. Not wait? Asked the sentence. All will be fall, replied the pear, and ((then)) it will be forsaken. One may lose regardless of gazing lookingly. This episode of yours is hardly less meek. It will befall everyone. But when the sentence gazed into the pair and saw herself reflected in its golden skin, she knew otherwise. How then can my befallen state be the same as any other? When one has just heard brave news, replied the pear. That one has been granted a wish. The sentence must ((contrive)) to complete itself. Confound the one who first distinguished the hours. Continue the sentence. Thus my body becomes a question. Who assembled the first sundial whose shadows played these letters to no end. So the second part of this book is called tales in miniature and um they are tales constructed of three words. So you get to imagine (()) ((Thoreau)) (()) ((till.)) Woodcutters. Pebble. Prattle. Bannister. Water. Wait. Letter. Falcon. ((Hidden.)) Purpled. Snarl. Lilt. And then the last section is an associative dictionary called festoon dictionary which= is= which is not alphabetical. So the book moves from tales that are roughly about a page to the three world tales to then the tale within each word. So I'll read a few dictionary entries. Checkered. Careful in the observance of quick fire and ceremony. Superstition. The spine of a herring with the ribs extended. Hoof. The quality of being strident. We struck the main road impetuously. Plow. ((Antidote)) to stiffening. Other. Unknown sound of certainty. Crimson. That portion of floor of a room on which a fire stands. Barricade To please to such a degree as to smother resistance. Spherical. Writing in the walls. Ether. Being such in name only. Canary. A gown like outer garment with four limbs modified to wings. Seed. A group of letters representing a word. Glade. A temporary stillness. Moon wise a long slender+ # slender, downward, curved bill. Sleep. To fasten inaction. Star. Written in superscript. Retinol rising. And then uh I'm going to read from probably my newest project which is called um scorpion odes and I was investigating the= the nat- # the natural and literary history of the scorpion. Also as a metaphor for various cultural ((maladies)) at the moment. Work in progress. So, starting with two quotations from Shakespeare. Some private scorpion do you pontificate. And from Shelley A mind that broods over guilty woes is like a scorpion girt by fire. Scorpion ode. I pray the dictionary. I ask pardon of dream. I feared scorpions in their silence and walked each morning into the rising mountain. I vowed not to become the nullifying silence but to nullify the other paralysis being born. To speak with the elevated precision of silence. From the marrow of consciousness the living aspect of which appears solid but isn't complete until we have left the word, the mountain, and the ((scorpionic)) premises. Departure. I speak from another vantage, though it is not mine. Nothing is anyone's, formally speaking. Even if you walk along this particularity of gasping ordination. A mind is more akin to the moment. If you could hold it and walk alongside me I'd be somewhere. Driven to the particle within ((miniature)) fluctuations of light. Not visible light, but what turns you and pulls you from your bed on a morning as such, you would rather not be bidden. Wakeful refraction is the missing testimony of leaving. Where are you going? And how will you get there? Scorpion ode. I watched the reader read and the scores upon calendars looked back upon me I tried to read from the book but even magnified I could not see it. What scurried beneath the book I cannot say. I hung upon the walls. Not regret, but a ship below a bat. A door partially open.	Speaker1
