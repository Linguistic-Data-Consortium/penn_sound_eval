We will be playing the killed civilians For a while, half sleep. It seemed much better but given insomniac anxiety, it was in fact not better Bright lights refracted back downward under the blue black clouds into one of the world's tiniest airports The wheels made their dark, ripping sound as the bottom opened Still I'm endlessly making up for lost time Shunt the folded twists up and down the synapse. There were questions but it was simpler just pointing to that spot Plans big follow through compromised No blades, awls, large shampoos, or gels Headquarters miscalculated We must stick with it So much has already been invested He responds to the downturn by more intense tactics of marketing Photoshop satiety Brightness, seductive pouting chiaro scuro how to trigger someone's desire Mortgage companies began to destabilize, then to fail Real assets did not match their liabilities the ogham slice and one more slice on the tree thick stone. Is this a real one or a fake? Who knows how to read this language All the big firms, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, Bear Stearns held artful arrangements of debts and slice and dice notes so intricately segmented that it was all finally untrackable The attack of the difficult spreadsheet Whatever was guaranteeing solvency might have been the same thing over and over Buzzer sound Ignore buzzer sound All of them making big money, big plunder, smash and grab, a pretty ugly ferment that foretold the rest And impossible to ignore, one would have thought what one would have thought got squandered There was no lack of telling and the operable lexicon couldn't turn away But it couldn't intervene, either The houses were broken, the walls fell open This is of course a pyramid scheme so the system began to collapse They were just rogue soldiers.
