Do you always keep the posters you put up on the walls? ((For)), you know, announcements for events? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I usually # I keep them uh # well, some of them, I keep on the bulletin board there. And some, I keep, like, on the door  behind, like, the kitchen door right here. ((It)) # ((I'm)) leaving it open now so you don't see them.  But, uh, because they're like, behind the door. Like we try # I guess what it amounts to is I don't like seeing all # I, like, keep so many of them, you know, all these movie posters and. And you save a lot of them? No, I throw them away as soon as they're obsolete. I don't want to have (()). Do you save yours? Well, I usually forget to take them down for about ((three or four months)) and then I {laugh}. Yeah. Well, having the door closed so much of the time, I mean, the o- # or rather open, I mean. Like it's open so it's up against the wall. So we usually don't even see those things unless we close the door so we can look because it's always more convenient to have this door to the back hallway open. So sometimes they do stay up. Just because we haven't really been paying any attention. We've been looking in the ((pink)) section or something. So, ev- every once in a while I pull them down and try # I just put the ((tacks)) back in without the ((announcements)). Because, yeah, I figured there'll be more announcements. They'll= they'll be coming in soon. Do you have a lot of stuff in your medicine cabinet? No. Real little. Do you want to know what I have here? {laugh} No. {laugh}. What= what the scent # what scent is that body oil? (()) ((all over the glass))? {laugh}. The body oil is uh natural. Yeah, it doesn't ((say)). It's natural because that's the (()). No ((scents)). No scen- # well, it does. It has a (()) that's strong ((scent)). Oily. Oh. Can I smell it? Yeah. Please. Natural for what animal? {laugh} I don't know. Like whatever animal uh sweated it out in the first place, ((I guess)). {laugh} (()). Peanuts or peanut oil. {laugh} ((Smell like the peanut oil)). Oh. {laugh} (()) {laugh} It is. Doesn't ((smell)) like anything. I think Sam's right. {laugh} ((Peanut oil)). Oh, gee whiz. ((And I'm an adult bringing Berkeley together)). {laugh} {laugh} {cough} Told you that's peanut oil. {laugh} ((I don't know who that is)). {laugh} ((Be careful)). Do you put things around to see if people will notice them? Oh, yeah. Do they? Absolutely. um Sometimes. I mean, a few people come in and they sort of like if we spend all our time in the kitchen, then they sort of say now wait a minute before they leave and they walk around through the other rooms to see if anything has changed. Do you ((ever spend holidays when you rearrange everything))? It doesn't take that long. {laugh} um But, well, sometimes I'll= I'll spend a while. But (()). Did you try (())? No. How long would it take to do everything? um {cough} To do everything? {laugh} Everything. At ((once))? Oh. {laugh} Wouldn't it depend on the thoroughness with which you, Yeah. you know, ((place on)) (())? How far away am I going to move things or am I just going to throw everything away and get new stuff? Are you going to put it back in the same place when you ((take it out))? {laugh} I really don't know. I (()). {laugh} It= it's like # it's a decision which I haven't conceived of very clearly. Why don't we see? Why don't we move everything around and then put everything ((back))? Oh, do you want to? {laugh} That is an idea. You'd have to take a vote, probably. ((Yeah, it is)). {laugh} See if everybody likes it. {laugh} ((Steve)), when you dust your shelves do you take everything off and then dust and then put everything back? No, I usually dust. I push things towards the back and then I dust around them. And= then= and then I'll # maybe I'll push them forward and dust ((and vacuum)). ((You every)) (())? {laugh} Yeah, I do. I do. In fact, that was one thing that I did do today. {laugh} (()). I don't vacuum. I don't vacuum, but I did do a little dusting and a few things. Do you have times when there isn't any dust? Don't this look like it to me. Times when there was no dust? (()). I haven't noticed. {laugh} I usually don't notice that there's dust or not. ((Shawn)). What about the little uh # the tiny little (()) ((for the)) ((My)) (()). Tiny messages on the strips of paper (()). (()) (()) I saw # I couldn't read one very well, but it seemed to say what do I expect from experience? (()). The one up in the front room there. This is like um That's new, isn't it? Those. That? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're ((seeing those)). Well, they= they are here, aren't they? {laugh} Sure. Sure. When you're a guest. {laugh} Yeah. How come you old people can notice (()) ((it)) in your house? um I don't know. I mean, I= I think it has like # it's some odd feeling that I have like that I don't appreciate it enough by myself. That's what I think it has to do with. That's like assuring. Yeah. It's like assuring me that, like, it's good stuff. Or that it's a good way to look at stuff or something. And it's # yeah, it's like validation or something. And like enjoyment. I mean, I really feel like if somebody came in and they really were interested it= it's # I mean, it's some # it's like a performance thing is what it is, I guess. Do you ever feel angry because people don't get it? {laugh} Does that make it invalid? I don't know. {laugh} How about somebody you really wanted to impress and they come in and they just don't notice? That ((happen))? They're really not. Yeah, they're just, you know, what= what is that ((found you))? um d- Does that lower them in your estimate? Yeah. I mean, that's sort of like the same question as Barry's. I feel like Right, right. I really try to turn off my feelings about that and, like, ignore whether # like I= I pretend to myself that I don't really care whether they're interested or not in what's there. And then I pretend that, like, I wasn't expecting anything about that.	spk_0
