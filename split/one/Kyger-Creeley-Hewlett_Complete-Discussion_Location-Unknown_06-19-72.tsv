Yeah, sure. Technically, you know the parameters of= of technical ((requirements)) are really ((wide, you know)) So you can have any # as long as you have a volume you can ((have)) (()) (()) ((any shape)) (()) Almost, you have to have certain ((depths)) and certain (()) (()) and then the placement of where you put the ((ponds)) (()) Basically (()) ((Immediately)) (()) ((like to be able to walk among the)) (()) Oh ((did)) (()) ((Incredible numbers of birds)) (()) Oh, that'd be terrific. Oh, yeah. ((That should be)) (()) So that uh # just the (()) # ((I mean you should)) # ((the person who thinks of it has to think more like a)) (()) (()) yeah, as a ((park.)) {laugh} (()) (()) {laugh} (()) there (()) Yeah, ((no matter what)) (()) ((be a lot of water)) ((Freshwater)) ((Lot of birdwatching too.)) (()) (()) ((got)) {laugh} (()) when= when will it be available for public sale? {laugh} I don't know. (()) don't know. That's a really good question. (()) ((I would think next spring)) You think that (()) (()) Anybody have a cigarette? I (()) cigarette ((I'm not saying)) (()) ((trying get this)) (()) ((say yesterday, what happened that was like)) I have uh (()) no= no= no= no. I ((have one thing to add)) (()) I thought it should be (()) literally should  time for um # at one point (()) okay, Joanne. ((that's)) (()) And you can get like uh # so you get a group ((sum)) and then what's in the group ((sum)) You have like a series of individual things happening. I just don't (()) If you want you could cut out some (()) Group ((sum)) is the basis out of which the individual then gets to (()) (()) Which (()) (()) to say that people How would you like (()) Excuse me. are kind of (()) ((they're not thinking to respond, but they do.)) ((I mean)) for example if you have when children grow up (()) you w- # y= you recognize ((this)) (()) parent or as the person that's ((involved with them)) that their language and modes of language change with incredible int- intensity and rapidity. ((I mean, in fact)) for example when I # when one of my sons was very young he could # it wasn't that he could learn, in ((the sense)) put his mind to, but that he absorbed let's say the ability to speak French within, you know, very short time and then when we shipped him to Mallorca where the people were speaking Mallorquin primarily ((Oh)) (()) ((uh)) he for example within six months was out on the street mocking a French tourist with these Mallorquin kids, not as a social (()) but because now he was in their language (()) and he= he factually, ((this French friend came to visit)) and all the Mallorquin kids would dance around and mocking his way of speaking and uh David among them. So then this French friend, knowing that ((he'd)) seen David six months before in France ((speaking)) impeccable French {laugh} {laugh} said something to him in French and David had literally forgotten it. So what I'm trying to say is that the # that= that advent of sounds ((that are)) (()) ((the head)) is like an ((endless)) (()) ((is like a)) You don't have to try to do it. ((When)) you're always writing in terms of the ((quote)) of the context in which it (()) Not really ((socially or)) psychologically but physically. Like if you're up in the air ((you're writing)) (()) Okay (()) sure. Okay. (()) I'm still ((back on like uh)) the actual voicing of it. which is um Yeah. and ((certainly you've gone)) # I don't know how many poetry readings (()) you must have ((done)) endless amounts and they usually they come out (()) fairly flat and demanding a certain amount of concentration and some (()) ((the sound in it)) To me personally the m- and I'm just trying to get the (()) ((like a)) music is a # rock music is ((a)) (()) people are aware of ((like)) Yeah. how you can get (()) ((with sound)) Yeah. and like uh poets now trying to ((like)) use part of that is like L- l- let's (()) trying to make the tone or the sound of poetry really start to move a lot more than like a translation from the page. It goes too much ((like a)) # it goes back from a you get it, you write it down and then your voice in= a= in a effort to make it come back to life again Right. but the voice like ((can)) # it's like a reading voice to (()) and it just sounds like the= the voice True. ((isn't)) the voice of a person, ((is it)) really alive and ((that's)) (()) No. it slowed down last night Right. and (()) I know they must have been ringing through his head Sure. in that strange ((manner)) which he really (()) didn't (()) # didn't ((you)) find ((the)) (()) Yeah. (()) for example, (()) and I were reading this radio play together uh two days ago and one ((paradox)) that she noted I ((came out and say well)) w- what do you think it sounded like since she has the so-called profess- # no, she has the actual professional knowledge of that whole (()) so I was ((thinking)) do you think it was okay, ((I mean)) she would just ((mail)) it and I don't want to listen to it again, you know. {NSV} So, you know, ((anyhow)) she said yeah but (()) and she ((noted)) what was curious to her was that there's a section of this play in which one of the people speaking is= is reading production notes for the actual performance of the so-called play and that's part of the play is reading these notes and the point is that I was (()) # I was reading those notes and she said what was funny was that when you were reading those notes you= were= you were (()) like you sounded like someone not really reading notes but your voice became very relaxed and (()) you were reading notes to me. When you were reading the parts that were proposed as conversational interchange, those were the parts that ((went)) peculiarly stilted and= and not that you'd you know, ((fuck)) them up entirely but those were the parts that didn't sound ((in that relaxed)) (()) {NSV} And one # again, one ((damn)) dilemma as a writer ((or as a)) poet more accurately, hopefully is that how to get the context to be ((that)) (()) in what you're reading so that the voice comes through (()) ((same way.)) Because reading something has (()) possibilities, well as # otherwise Yeah, well, I realized ((at)) your reading ((at that)) # it got into that cozy sense. Well, see I was (()) yeah of being just # being read to which is very soothing and relaxing. I love that sense, I suppose one of the real imprints on my own so-called consciousness would be ((the)) (()) being read to as a kid which was a ((beautifully)) (()) moment. Mhm. and also the sense, which I've always been shy of, but I've always truly hungered for is the reading where you're reading to four to five six friends Uh huh. So that the residence is a completely uh clear # not clear but they really # have a really you know that	Speaker1
