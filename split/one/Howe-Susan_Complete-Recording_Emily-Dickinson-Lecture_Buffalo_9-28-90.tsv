Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90	3.09	537.964	Now wait a minute (()) hold it. (()) Wait. No it's not, it's= okay= it's= okay= it's okay. It's just (()) (()) ((missing)) (()) I was ((right.)) Alright. (()) ((Just so you should take)) (()) ((see what you've got.)) That's the reverse order. ((Mhm.)) It's not (()) I know, but see I'm so messed up, no. No. I believe that that's our first one. No. No. It should say ((fit or feet)) of her. Oh, damn. This is what we have in this # this was the # this was in the ((book)) # the projector in that order. Where did ((we)) go. We've done something ((wrong)) (()) It could be that it's stuck in the Alright, well anyway let's tr- # I give up. I mean (()) (()) (()) (()) no, see, t- two are missing. Two are missing, it must # they must have gone down. (()) that's what ((I)) (()) (()) Alright. Okay. Alright, we're going back (()) Go back. {NSV} You've got that (()) I think that that is our (()) Alright, we've just got to skip that beautiful poem, I'm sorry. ((Some to go on.)) (()) (()) No. Oh, wait a second. That could be this. Wait a second. (()) ((There appear to be)) (()) There it is. {NSV} Thank god. Is that it? ((See this)) was recently discovered in Amherst. Oh. (()) (()) this is (()) (()) I'm no fan of (()) Okay, now c- can you get the one on the other side there? ((I don't know but)) (()) Yes. There. Okay. ((Somehow)) this is obviously fading fast. So um {cough} this is a poem (()) # this poem continues, it's unusually long for her, okay. So you open the thing now, you open the sheet and this is what the situation is on= on a= a sheet of ((oh)) # you know, two sides. Okay, but it # the poem doesn't end til that line. Alright. um This line at the bottom, here's one of these two line things that to me are very important. I # again, I mean, I don't know if she ran out of paper or could she have said # why did she not say Well, I ran out. She does line things up very carefully. But why does she not start he must pass the crystal angle over on that page and let this go down. What decision, where that decision come but whatever ha- has happened you are left with he must pass the crystal angle that obscure her face, which to me is a completely fantastic line # two lines and break. And it's a he now, remember her sweet ((um)) t- # her sweet turn to leave the homestead.  He must pass the crystal angle that obscure her face and then up there, he must have achieved in person equal paradise and then all those variants um and then that's the end of that poem but um he must pass that cr- (()) # the crystal angle is= is just # I can't get to the bottom of that line. um It (()) ((has)) (()) obviously somewhere. reference to Revelations but= but I think that it's very important that there's a cross over the word angle. Now you can go back and figure out and Johnson will show you what should go there but uh I don't # to me that's not important. um Let me just thinking ((of)) (()) uh distance be her # oh (()) # distance be her only motion is a beautiful # that's another # now you see there with these crosses, I don't know distance be her only motion (()) d- don't you feel that there's some # I don't know, (()) ((asking her something)) That's what I ((thought)) (()) that's what I think. (()) um Like she might not be consistent either. Usually. No, I don't think they (()) # see I- I don't # I mean, I think if you're looking for any kind of answer or consistency you'll never find it. I mean that's what (()) she's ((again)) # that's what she's (()) ((yes)) (()) ((right)) completely against. ((Yes.)) But um and that demurral, all the things that demure, I mean a demure woman but a demure is both refusal and you know, o- okay, I would do it. It's= it's two different things. um The whosoever, she's # she repeatedly used whoso and whosoever in this (()) um {cough} and then there- there's this short poem after it, pain has an element of blank. One of my students um wrote a really interesting paper on= on Dickinson's use of blanks. Of just blanks in Dickinson and um blanks as being charged things and um I mean, I think that this way of printing the poems and looking at= the= at= the= at # at the poems really (()) very much shows # I mean, that's true and that's really uh # then I love that new periods of pain and then day, the word day, because, you know, when you're terribly depressed {laugh} you wake up and it's another day, it's just another # you know # I think that it's beautiful way that day is just ((fitting)) in at the bottom and then the line kind of spreads along after it rather than really under it. um The three little crosses at the top were made by someone else. um You know, as= as a marking. um Another student # I had this minister who was in my class at Temple this year and uh he= he made this wonderful statement work of Emily Dickinson is covered with crosses. and= and I thought that was just gorgeous and (()) it is, I mean, not only are # is it covered with these crosses but it's covered with crossings and crosses that you don't know where= where you are or what you # where you should be. um Any # anybody want to say anything about any ((I would)) (()) Yeah. (()) ((the same)) (()) handwriting I c- # yeah. No, they w- # they're really # I mean they- they're very different. and they're not just plain dashes and sometimes commas look like dashes and sometimes the top of ~T's, like up here. um This is like # these are sort of like (()) those, see what I mean? And then they # (()) when= you= when you start um really (()) ((I don't know how)) (()) Dickinson because when you start ((worrying)) about it ((see)) with how much space she leaves between poems (()) becomes a big (()) to me it becomes a big issue and then I wonder, am I just # ((is this)) silly, I mean ((is it a mystery)) or ((isn't it)) (()) and then but the worst issue is the dashes and I just # I think that um ((you)) (()) are really the way to do it. The ideal way ((to do anything)) (()) poem on one side and (()) printed uh you know, a (()) # a transcription on the other side. But I think you would (()) # you know, you would try to match those dashes in the directional pull, the way she does, but you couldn't really. Anyways, ((you've missed something.)) You could never ((you see)) you couldn't ((cross ~T's)) like that. And this little mark here, you couldn't (()) well, here's um This is the (()) # we're sort of like um so much summer is on the # that'll be # that would be on the end of= of the series that I've just been talking about. (()) ((slides)) ((Huh?)) We ((had)) the (()) but they both jammed in the printer and that ((caused)) the uh (()) got them out. Want them? Yeah (()) Okay. No. (()) just (()) I (()) I wouldn't dare try anything (()) and I think Well, if we could get (()) ((would)) be alright to (()) But would # but look at this poem here (()) # I'm sorry it's so dim now, but look at the crossed ~T's on this one. So much summer me for showing illegitimate. Illegitimate alone on the line there would a smile's minute bestowing too exorbitant to the lady with the guinea. This is one of these poems.	Speaker1
