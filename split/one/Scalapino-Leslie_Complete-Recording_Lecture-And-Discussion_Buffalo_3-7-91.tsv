Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91	0.16	547.566	To a moment or like a moment {cough} w- wanting to like continue it just a little long- longer as a unifying time capsule. A kind of pressing # that kind of pressing that that Bob was describing as the pressure of O'Hara. Like he wants to have a moment which is kind of vague when you read it like on the page. Yeah. But yet as you said before in relation to the poems ((it)) like it occurs quickly as a ((procession)) {cough} but as recorded it seems to somehow want to ((just)) push the limits of what would otherwise be considered a moment. And you also use the expression resonance and duration. I think that that is sort of a kind of a # ((oh boy)) {breath} ((a)) characterization of this moment. Right, well it's the conflict between the fact that you can apprehend ((an)) huge amount but you c- # but in order to write that, to say it i- is ((um)) ((it c- # in the um #)) a- and the fact that you're (()) # u- uh if you're unable to write that uh would be it's impossible and also that your perception or your being in the moment, the moment doesn't exist anyway. um So it's attempting to to realize that In other words that you've completely fabricated this ((and)) your sense of the moment uh it has never existed and it isn't there um So I relate that to that previous question of whether something's being nullified. In a sense there is that, ((that uh)) it has to be your understanding that you can only exist in the present, but you're never in it and that it {NSV} and that you can't um # and that it doesn't exist {laugh} anyway. So you don't want to be limited by the boundaries of a coherence {laugh} ((So #)) that itself is # ((I would say doesn't exist.)) Right, well it's kind of as if= if you had the moment as a frame so to speak, if that made any sense, that you would the= the= the writing will go past # it will kind of go past that boundary and it will show you that it's past that boundary by being so big or um through something like that but it demonstrates that tension of being inside or outside of something. ((It's)) Is it also illusory because it's an example of uh like what you've been talking about, fabricating um a sense of the moment or a construct of the moment out of the past, out of what you remember? Is= that= is= that= relevant= is that relevant to ((your)) # I mean, once you get past the moment you're still writing, that moment has passed. You're in a sense remembering something or what it was like when that moment was taking place, which still is= is # you know, it's not possible {breath} ((uh)) Yes, u- uh right, but you would always be {NSV} it's simp- # it is simply that, that you would always be behind time even if you're sitting right here ((Time.)) um There's no such thing, because you're {laugh} ((not)) if you're in s- # in the second, y- # it's already behind you I'm= I'm interested in this= this whole idea of um constructing um o- of= of um constructing some kind o- of= oh um uh linguistic surface or a poem out of the past out of what's # you know out of what's remembered in a sense. The images like you know ((here)) are not nullified because they're= still= they're still something left over and= and that is just a sense of= of what's been constructed out of what= what he remembers. I'm struggling with it a lot because I'm having a really hard time trying to um articulate what I'm thinking about and I have been thinking about this a lot um in terms of my work ((w- uh #)) in the poetry of John Ashbery which I think has a lot, which # the discussion today of O'Hara's poem has a lot of= of resonance with # I see him as also constructing this= this kind # th- this you know, this= this linguistic web and= and his you know wr- # u- uh and working in like just extended long sentences and that kind of thing, especially in things like a s- # um= um The System. But it's # there's still a sense of u- um even though the surface # you know even though you know it's= h- it's highly rotten, rhetorical and superficial, there's still somehow, something being remembered into the # you know into the present of experiencing that text and= and I was wondering if you kind of thought about # the I mean uh {NSV} # anyway I mean this is what um= um you know that what I was thinking of anyway is= is like the work of of Ashbery, especially like in his longer more, you know more meditative kind of works. I think it works ((with= with that)) O'Hara {breath} uh Yes. {laugh} ((uh Let me see.)) I don't know. um But I think in # actually in both cases it seems to me there is this sense of ((uh)) walking down Second Avenue, literally. Wanting to render that present time experience. Yes. Mhm. ((uh)) And the ((w- #)) only way to do that is with this enormous backlog, Oh. and then it becomes about that as well. um Yeah. Not to belabor a point but I think {cough} when you talked about Duncan's # ((what if)) Duncan and O'Hara crossed paths in terms of ((sense)) of immediacy or something ((I haven't been # to be fair, I missed it. I didn't quite uh say much we'd be talking about how)) Duncan's not ((speaking)) for something That's beyond ((the sense. Right, this is the present as well, or I miss something?)) ((That little thing.)) Well, I was uh interpreting this as trying to read actual experience, and that that is of um ((Oh.)) um {breath} ((w-)) # he would use the vocabulary of saying that is uh i- in the heightened sense because actual {laugh} experience is that. But in other words it's not something that is removed from one that is um in the nature of say of uh religion which is a doctrine which you learn in which you are distanced from God or ((um)) uh {NSV} you are that and you have to realize that, ((huh.)) So= you're= ((s-)) so you're saying it's= it's not # like the platonic reading is not ((reading a bit more than junk)) meaning uh= uh the experience as something that # as a reflection of something out there rather than the important thing itself. uh Say that again? {laugh} {breath} Wow. um {laugh} No, the uh {laugh} Yeah, I mean ((just I was)) # I've been thinking about Dun- # or I'm thinking about both Duncan and O'Hara {cough} in terms of ((damned enemies)) in poetry and being very different, I was interested in this point of intersection we were talking about and um {breath} the uh {breath} # I've done readings of Duncan in terms of sort of platonic ((way of the part in)) experience or the material of what's actually going on is not as ((you)) said, not as important as what= what it suggests. ((Sometimes in the realm)) and that ((soul)) is sort of not really ((world)) and I'm # ((so I was)) interested in  ((what if anything the idea of human ex- # we're talking experience)) Well, that # it's confusing because one doesn't know what transcendent realm or whatever. ((I've)) Yeah, ((or what it is.)) because what I think he's trying to do in the ~HD book is to say # to bring it back to something that # where the one self or all objects or all beings are= {cough} are the germ of uh what life is and the ((fantasy)) that's the= uh the essence or quintessence of that, it's not abstract. That's what he means by the actual Okay. But then {NSV} that's {NSV} um # so that's what's being read, that's what's being seen, it's the um um and that's what he means by words like magic or ((writhe)) um It's apprehending that aspect of something in the actual being uh (({cough})) rather than removing it from one's self as a um {breath} {lipsmack} ((er)) reflection on that as= if= it we- as i- # more # rather than being descriptive, it's evocative in terms of writing {NSV} But that's the whole thing. I mean, it's # and it's very difficult to= uh= to uh {laugh} describe that. Ha. No, don't # uh be ((a big)) # Duncan I don't think his= his impulse or= in- or intent is= to= uh {cough} is to translate that particularities of	Unknown1
