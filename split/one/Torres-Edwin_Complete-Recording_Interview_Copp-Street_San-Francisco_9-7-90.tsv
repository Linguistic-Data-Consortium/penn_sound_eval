Torres-Edwin_Complete-Recording_Interview_Copp-Street_San-Francisco_9-7-90	0.21	434.825	So ((and)) I have these uh uh luscious (()) of almost abstract uh images because ((there- there'll)) be # you know, really (()) dramatic blowups of only fractions of photographs in the uh # in= in uh uh magazines. Yeah. uh But you could # you'll be able to see like the uh # the= the glass rim of uh the= the vice president's uh ((you know)) just, you know, the corner of the uh # the= the glass ((is)) the vice president (()) who is like uh uh Cardinal Richelieu, you know, he's like a ((power in)) # uh ((a power in)) the sh- # in the shadow ((yeah)) uh or the ((sideburn)) of the prime minister, you know, the= the # it was very funny because uh uh when he was elected he was (()) young, he was in (()) his uh, you know, early forties {NSV} and uh then like overnight his= his sideburns went white. because ((you know, they're like)) {laugh} (()) ((you know)) (()) ((respectability)) and you know, like ((patina)) of uh ((inexperience)) or whatever (()) so that may be another one. uh Then you may have seen another= another picture, the earring of uh Franco's uh granddaughter. You know, who was married to uh uh uh a French uh antique dealer or the smile of uh (()) almost like a Gioconda smile of uh Isabella Preysler who is a= a notorious uh uh # kind of glorified courtesan that has been married to # first to a= a= a= a pop singer, Julio Iglesias, who was uh uh uh uh her first husband then she married a= a= a count uh and then uh uh she married uh uh Boyer who at the time was uh like a super minister. He was the minister of economics and= and uh and finances. and (()) probably the most powerful uh minister in Spain ((at the)) time (()) government and so she always kind of, you know, like uh uh uh uh maneuvers herself into associating herself with, you know, the most powerful men at the moment and uh so (()) So what part of her (()) uh The (()) the smile, because she has this really like a Gioconda smile. You know, she looks like a porcelain uh= uh uh doll. She uh comes from a- uh a Philippine family ((in a)) (()) the= the Philippines were a Spanish uh dominion and all that and uh is very cold and very ((elegant)) and= and= and but at the same time just pure (()) (()) because (()) another thing that has happened in= in= in Spain is that uh um the uh uh politics and= and high culture  and= and uh and tabloid culture has all become completely ((mixed+)) in a # indiscriminately mixed and= and Like here? uh but (()) ((even= even more there.)) It's really amazing. I mean y- you= would= you would buy uh a= a magazine that would be the equivalent of uh # of Time Magazine or Newsweek and it's just appalling because uh at least (()) magazines # American magazines that they may be biased (()) and you know, you can read very clearly between the lines, you know, where the ideology is and everything but they still talk about serious issues. You know uh the main # at least the= main= the main uh features. You know, whatever happens ((in)) (()) ((is one)) international (()) talk about ((whoever, yeah)) uh and ((the)) international uh uh uh you know, affairs and so on uh but it d- # never gets ((as low)) as= as what uh the Spanish magazines ((uh uh)) ((or)) (()) and they claim that they have to (()) otherwise people don't buy them. But uh I mean it's like they go to the ((point)) of= of telling you who's ((living with= with)) # (()) with= with whom, you know, and uh in= in= in the government {laugh} you know {laugh} who- who's mistress is, you know, (()) in a # in # in a # it's= it's just a- amazing, you know um uh It's kind of like the National Enquirer crossed with (()) Oh, yes, but= but the point is that ((you know)) it- it's not the National Enquirer, it's supposed to be Newsweek. Mhm. You know. And uh that's one part (()) the oth- # the other part of it is the= the= the socialist government in an attempt to uh uh associate themselves with um uh the most progressive ((you know)) uh uh ((and)) ((stylish and visible, you know, strata of)) society they= they= they= they ((like to hang out with)) artist and= and uh and singers and pop singers and, you know, ((so)) again ((but)) also has helped that= that= that sort of (()) not having a clear boundary w- where you know, the= the party ends  and= the= and= the= and the real serious business ((begin.)) ((Do you know)) (()) you know the book After the Great Divide? I- I heard of it. (()) his whole thesis is that that's= that's the signal of # that's ((postmodernism)) (()) modernism was ((Yeah, I haven't read it though.)) Yes. this division between high and low and postmodernism is Mhm. (()) disintegration of that Yeah. Mhm. um I should # I- I want to have you talk about what's going to happen in Cambridge. It's (()) (()) yeah, mhm. (()) and um what's # I mean the whit- # the nineteen eighty nine Whitney Biennial controversy. um Were you surprised by the controversy (()) blind (()) ((you didn't)) Yeah. I= was= I was getting a (()) uh ready to= to= to fight a good one in Indianapolis Uh huh. because I thought that that was going to= uh to really # to uh uh make a big stink Uh huh. and= uh and nothing happened. It didn't. It didn't happen and= uh and ((you know)) ((in)) the ((backyard,)) you know {laugh} (()) ((totally)) unexpectedly then ((you know)) (()) thing just you know, blow up in my face and= and (()) you know. It was a (()) surprise in New York (()) (()) Do you (()) I mean, as ((you)) said before ((thought)) that there were # has there any # been any long term effects from # I mean um (()) # I don't know what there would be um as usual in those kinds of situations you've got a lot of ((extra)) free publicity. M- more people found out about the piece than would have found out about it ((if that wouldn't have)) happened. Mhm. um (()) it's= it's a double-edged thing because uh uh at= at one point I- I had to actually (()) tell the reporters when= when they called if they were only interested in= in the uh uh you know all the= the big scandal and everything, the fact that, you know, that two museums # or actually three museums were, you know involved in the whole thing and they= they only wanted ((th- there to)) (()) ((there wasn't)) interested you know, that they were only going to get my= my side of= the= of the story if they were going to= to talk about the piece Mhm. ((but)) the ((content was)) and= and (()) the work. You know, the= the (()) Yeah. The other thing that (()) I mean in= in another kind of appropriation every time you saw the image in these articles about the controversy, it was never the whole image.
