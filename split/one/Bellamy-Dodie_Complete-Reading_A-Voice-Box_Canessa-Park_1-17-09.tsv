Bellamy-Dodie_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Canessa-Park_1-17-09	0.16	373.381	Two sets, double deckered on each window. White with a four inch band of pink and white stripes, hideous half inch wide, vertical, pink and white stripes that cycle through my memories over and over. The jabbing ((eek, eek, eek)) of the soundtrack to a migraine commercial or the movie scene where the crazed killer stabs his butcher knife over and over. ((Eek, eek)), pink and white, ((eek)), pink, ((eek, eek)), white, pink. The four of us are on our bed listening to the Doors and smoking grass. Janice's mother walks in the room and John holds the joint on the side of the bed out of sight. Shirley makes a face and signs, what's that smell? Janice signs back incense. Shirley gave a high pitched scream when she was upset. I heard it often, invariably directed at Janice's father or Elka, his Hungarian mother who lived down the street and who tried to rule their lives. Elka's the only reason Janice and Sharon shared a double bed. When the twin beds Shirley had ordered arrived, Elka appeared and told the delivery men to take them back. Sisters sleep together. That's the Hungarian way and there was nothing Shirley could do about it. As soon as Janice could form a sentence, she became the family translator. Nine years old, called in from jump scoping # j- {NSV} # nine years old called in from jump roping to explain the leaky faucet to the plumber, to negotiate with the insurance agent, to tell Elka no while Shirley screamed in the background. Elka was intense. One time I was at her house when the toilet clogged and she rolled up her sleeve and stuck her arm in and unwedged the shit with her hand. She'd been in the States like forty years, but never adapted. Her English was broken. And when she rode in a car, she'd sit in the backseat white knuckling the door handle and saying slower, slower. Outside it was so cold the snot in your nose froze. Elka scolded Janice and Sharon for leaving the house. {foreign} she'd shout. The streets are icy. It was her catchphrase like go ahead, make my day was for Clint Eastwood. {foreign}. She said it so often Sharon and John spray painted it across the garage door. Lying on Janice+ # Janice's bed smoking a joint, one of us randomly shouts {foreign} and the four of us laugh until spittle flies out of our mouths. Yeah. We had no idea if the crystals on John's windshield were real or if we were hallucinating them. John had just started computer school in Chicago. He was all excited about it. Said computers were the wave of the future. That within our lifetimes, cash money was going to be obsolete and all money transactions would be done with computers. They just introduced major credit cards. And whenever you'd use your card, the clerk would have to make sure your card wasn't bad by pulling out a booklet with thousands of bad credit card numbers listed in teeny type. And everybody in line would shuffle impatiently while the clerk looked through the booklet to see if your card was listed there. It took forever. So we scoffed at John's foolishness. But of course John's real foolishness was dropping out of computer school after six months because he would have gotten in on the ground floor and he'd be rich. I wonder what he looks like now. Is he pot bellied, balding, with a chain smoker's cough, sitting in front of his home entertainment center, drinking beer after beer, feeling like a loser? He was so handsome. A hothead and a loudmouth, to be sure. But his affection was uncomplicated. You could count on it. Janice and I both loved him, though we never would have admitted it. That hasn't changed for me. When I love people, I hide it like a cat hides its illness. As if my love were a dirty little secret. I might love you for instance, and you'd never even know it. I didn't think much about the future in those days. I wanted things to stay the way they were forever. To be a college student living away from home, check from my parents arriving at the beginning of each month. I studied hard, aced my courses, got stoned nights and weekends. Nothing could be better than that. My biggest fear for my future was that at some unimaginably distant point, like when I was eighty maybe, I'd turn into a person who no longer took ~LSD. Some horrible old robot, all dried up and old and efficient. What if I woke up into a twenty first century world without magic? I long to look in the mirror and see that nineteen year old self standing behind me, sweaty and musky, long strawberry hair parted down the middle , pupils dilated, fingers ((gnawed)) bloody. I smile at her and say I'm not so bad. I write books. I go to coffee houses. I give readings. She flashes on my sex life and rolls her green, stoned eyes. She can see everything. My sobriety, my reserve. How when I get home, the first thing I do is head for the kitchen and wash my hands as if to shake the world from my fingers. I say I have a pink Chenille bathrobe just like you.  Even though they're near impossible to find in two thousand and nine. I make raw almond milk twice a week. You haven't tripped since nineteen eighty one, she says. Scrunching up her face and jutting out her lower lip like Doris Day about to blow her bangs sky high. Sharon was tall and thin with large eyes and lips.	Subject
