Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	10.048	632.9	I think I closed this (()) group with a (()) in there. In the ends of the earth. It's called weight less than the shadow, which is a line I take from (()) forty seventh count of um who= who even dead yet hath his mind entire. Weight less than the shadow. We encounter in the lateral tunnel with great depth. I wear in my forehead of debut at newly acquired the gift. In fact, as a young lady casts an intense circle beyond whose rocky confines blackness, nothing. Your seamed face, as in a developing fluid, coagulates the lips ((lift)) to tell me I have not yet solved the riddle of the universe. The bird in the cage I carry has died, you point out. Misled, I'd gotten off the elevator at the wrong level. You shrug, but cast the dice on my behalf. Back, they indicate, to the pithead. Collect nothing from the company store except I sank these shafts. Your fierce outburst, at last. To hear that voice and have seen just your next old man. Brown shapes of continents on the skin over the excited hands. Sarcastic. This far down, we use another kind of pickaxe. The right hand, forefinger extended, lightly taps your temple. Then quickly down to the pocket still. And what do you come up with? With a dollar bill? I have to buy a ball point pen and five blue examination booklets at the commissary. This is becoming ridiculous. A dream. Four of them? To wrap my lunchtime apples in the fifth. Turns into a bluebird for my cake. I'll write it out. You pull your plastic goggles down over your eyes and I see just as you turn away myself, indistinctly, reflecting. The moon leaving the lift. Your turn. Aches. Blindingly. Some small, soft hand clasps mine. Or a man's hand merely does she grasp Maintaining, she'll lead me away from the pitfalls. Her path takes me on a suspect tangent. ((Dazzled)) still my other senses would rescue me. My watch beats my heart. Tsunami on the march of ragged and conflicting voices raised in song. They argue in the singing. Is it not my comrades? Changing shifts that late already? Globules of soil roll under my stumbling. Progress. If that's the word. There, she, you says she laughs dimly. Her face swims clear there. I bought you a silly bird that he wanted out. And so the grilled small gate hangs open. Next minute we hear how good a cook she is. Next, You old mold working right through lunch break under our feet. Knock, I mean deep rooted trees vibrate about me. Not back you said, simply. The tunnels are unending. How can I confront you with the cage of an absconded trapeze artist? Will you be angry? I won't descend. Will you shrug merely? I won't come again. She is leading me on to Dalian. She laughs. I won't budge. That the whistle, that the pit head shrills, until everyone is in the evening elevator down. I've slept dried spittle. That the whistle. The naked lady hears it as music. She has her gift of inattention, her hip bones flesh, the coal dust on her sheet. The mine I thought lay hidden, the fumes, however, render a whole district mine. A hard mattress. Emotionally the start are insatiable holds. We argue. I hold them. Daisy land. The stars are, the night is cold. I slurred. The word is cold, I said and she heard. The blonde, kiss holding. Go. Yes. Have there been women like this evening? She is gloriously unlike more. Is the agony by the peril of whose soulful presence I felt compelled to pour my soul's perilous adventures out to to say, or yearn to, desperately over and over I love you? Whatever misery ensue is happiness. Finding some vain ease in the mere saying As any mother's son. Though there were no other way of love. Inept to be wiser, to choose my silences. While we work life out together, taking carefully, and lending so the seams don't break. Or not yet. Not today. Or a flash of syntax similar is unavailing, as once more for the first time ever comes to be. This night, of all my life and all or nothing or, and nothing chance. Voices conspiring against voices for These choices must be that utterly ambiguous, these metaphors for what hasn't yet it shaped? Is also thought, too late. I spoke, revealing choice to be illusory. Let's make it more than that. Almost, I hated her. Who is breaking my heart open so that I'd say it? Be my fate. And she refuses, not to. She complied, being herself as no one else can do. I read the f- final mission. Whoever stood furthest up the trail was master of the trail, which for the most part climbed through a beautiful and crowded forest. Though the final four or five hundred yards' rise. Above the tree line, across tricky scree. And then, at that peak, which is also the scarp edge is steep. And despite the rumors, inaccessible drop on one side, the shallow slope on the other where the wood grows. That is mainly conifers. To be master meant to gather all those things, the ownership of which proves master good. A tribute. All other travelers are bound to pay. Two friends who thought to scorn such enchantment were walking through this wood one day side by side They were talking. An old story begun as they entered the shade wherein the trees address the pair of wanderers with promises of succor. When first one friend and the other heard the branches whisper as if to himself alone. And suddenly a most powerful odor overcame their senses. And a woman, naked, broad hips and sloping a shoulder stepped out of the thicket and beckoned. Now, both these men, in flight from a band of relatives who presently were pillaging their homesteads, hoped in the remotest hollow of the forest to find sanctuary and an abandoned mill of which they read. Yet the sight of this creature turned them. Where they fell to arguing, which of them first should address himself to her, who stood expectantly by. They decided, finally, the softest spoken should, he who had first heard the trees murmur. His companion making a joke of it, remarking your mother saw to it you were raised up was a due respect for womanhood. No sooner, however, was this agreed upon than he, this pleasant man, began to waver. Wondering whether the other might not be better for the job and even expressing doubt that he himself had any rights in this matter. Perhaps, he chuckled. I'm not really here at all. He was pushed forward, though. But when he approached the lady, she told him she might only yield herself.	Subject
