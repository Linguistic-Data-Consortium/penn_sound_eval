I wish to come to know you, get to know you all, ((let your)) belief in me, and me in you stand tall, just like a project of which no one tells, or do you still think that I am somebody else. Thank you. Sonnet. Each servant stamps the reader with a look. After many years, he has been brought nothing. The servant's frown is the reader's patience. The servant goes to bed. The patience rambles on musing on the library's lofty holes. His pain is the servant's alive. It pushes to the top stain of the wall, its treetop's head of excitement. Baskets, birds, beetles, spools. The light walls collapse next day. Traffic is ((the)) reader's pictured face. Dear, be the tree your sleep awaits. Worms be your words, you not safe from ours. This one is called How Much Longer Will I Be Able to Inhabit the Divine Sepulcher. How much longer will I be able to inhabit the divine sepulcher of life, my great love. Do dolphins plunge bottomward to find the light? Or is it rock that is searched, unrelentingly. ((Huh.)) And if some day men with orange shovels come to break open the rock, which encases me, what about the light that comes in then? What about the smell of the light? What about the moss? In pilgrim times he wounded me. Since then I only lie. My bed of light is a furnace choking me with hell and sometimes I hear salt water dripping. I mean it, because I'm one of the few to have held my breath under the house. I'll trade one red sucker for two blue ones. I'm named Tom. The light bounces off mossy rocks down to me in this glen. The neat villa which when he'd had he would not ((had he of)) And jests ((smarting and privet)) which on hot spring nights perfumes the empty rooms with the smell of sperm flushed down toilets on hot summer afternoons within sight of the sea. If you knew why then, professor, reads to his friends Drink to me only (()) and the reader is carried away by a great shadow under the sea. Behind the steering wheel {cough} a boy took out his own forehead. His girlfriend's head was a green bag of narcissus stems. Okay, you win. But meet me anyway at ((Cohen's)) drug store in twenty two minutes. What a marvel is ancient man. Under the tulip roots he has figured out a way to be a religious animal and would be a mathematician. But where in ((unsuitable)) heaven can he get the heat that will make him grow? For he needs something, or will forever remain a dwarf, though a perfect one. Possessing a normal sized brain. But he's got to be released by giants from things. And as the plant grows older, it realizes it will never be a tree. Will probably always be haunted by a bee and cultivate stupid impressions so as to not become part of the dirt. The dirt is mounting like a sea and we say goodbye, shaking hands in front of the crashing of the waves that give our words lonesomeness and make those flabby hands seem ours. Hands that are always writing things on mirrors for people to see later. Do you want them to water ((plant?)) Tear listlessly along exchangeable ivy, carrying food to mouth, touching genitals But no doubt you have understood it all now, and I am a fool. It remains for me to get better. and understand you so like a chair sized man. ((Boots)) were heard on the floor above. In the garden the sunlight was still purple. But what buzzed in it had changed slightly, but not forever. But casting its shadow on sticks and looking around for an opening in the air was quite as if it had never refused to exist differently. ((Guys)) in the yard handled the belt he had made. Stars painted the garage roof crimson and black. He is not a man who can read these signs. His bones ((were stays)) and even refused to live in a world and refunded the hiss of all exists terribly near us, like you, my love and light. For what is obedience but the air around us to the house for which the ((federal)) man came in a minute after the sidewalk had taken you home Latin. Blossom. After which you led me to water and bade me drink, which I did, owing to your kindness. You would not let me out for two days and three nights, bringing me books bound in wild thyme and scented wild grasses as if reading had any interest for me, you. Now you are laughing. Darkness interrupts my story. Turn on the light. Meanwhile, what am I going to do? I am growing up again, in school. The crisis will be very soon. And you twist the darkness in your fingers. You, who are slightly older. Who are you, anyway? And it is the color of sand, the darkness, as it sifts through your hand. Because what does anything mean? The ivy and the sand. ((That)) boat pulled up on the shore. Am I wonder, strategically, and in the light of the long sepulcher that hid death and hides me. The line in this poem about the un-assassinated president uh does not have any relation to the assassination of President Kennedy since the poem was uh written two years before that. Rivers and mountains. On the secret map the assassins cloistered. The moon river was marked near the eighteen peaks. ((and the)) city of humiliation and defeat. ((Wan)) ending of the trail among dry, papery leaves grey brown quills like thoughts and the melodious but vast mass of today's writing through fields and swamps marked on the map with little bunches of weeds. Certainly squirrels lived in the woods but devastation and dull sleep still hung over the land. Quelled, the rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons. Singing on marble factory walls, deaf consolation of minor tunes that pack the air with heavy, invisible rods pent in some sand valley to which only quiet walking ever instructs. The bird flew over and sat. There was nothing else to do. Do not mistake its silence for pride or strength or the waterfall for a harbor full of light boats that is there. Performing for thousands of people.	Speaker1
