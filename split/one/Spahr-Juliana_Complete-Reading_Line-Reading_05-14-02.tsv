And= then= and then the a= Alps and the tropical ice caps, and the poles? Indiana bat. And then they read that while a quarter of an inch does not seem like much, a rise of one foot of ocean level typically means that shorelines end up one hundred feet or more inland. Ironcolor Shiner. A sea rise of just three feet in Bangladesh would put one half of that nation under water, displacing more than one hundred million people. Jair Underwing. Already on the nine islands of Tuvalu farmers must grow their plants in containers because the rising sea level has seeped into the ground water. Jefferson Salamander. The four nations of Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and Tokelau Islands, each made up of ((many)) islands will most certainly be entirely displaced in the next thirty years. Karner Blue. (({lipsmack})) They themselves tended to live on islands and thinking about what this meant had provoked them to think so much about this rising ocean level and then to feel that the breaking off of the Antarctic Pine Island Glacier was all about them, or not all about them but as having a scary relevance to their lives. King Rail. They often lived on an island in the Pacific and they often lived on an island in the Atlantic. Lake Chubsucker. They thought of these two residences of theirs as opposites, though # although both were places of great economic privilege and resources, places that themselves consumed large amounts of resources and consumed more and more resources all the time. Lake Sturgeon. One= preferred= to= think of= itself= as= one preferred to think of itself as local and often in resistance to the United States, and one preferred to think of itself as international and often as a center of finance and culture for the United States. Least Bittern. One had a smallish city and one had one of the largest cities in the world. Least Tern. One was six hundred square miles and one was twenty six square miles. Leatherback Sea Turtle. Both were likely to feel the effects of this rising ocean issue, although many of the residents of both were pretending that was hap- # what was happening to the nations of Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and Tokelau Islands did not really foretell of anything relevant to them at all. Leedy's Roseroot. {NSV} Often late at night to allay their worries, they tried to see climate change as just one more tendency of life towards change. Little Bluet. They tried to look forward to the new fjord that would be created by the receding Colombia glacier in Alaska. Loggerhead Sea Turtle. They were fascinated by fjords, And there will soon be a new one to visit in ten years, they would say to themselves. Loggerhead Shrike. Perhaps even new plants would evolve there. Longear sunfish. Or they try to be comforted about how they grew up in a town that was located right at the edge of where the Wisconsin glacier had ended its journey. Longhead Darter. And because it had ended there, the soil in this area was especially rich, as the glacier pushed topsoil before it as it moved, then dumped it right where the town was now Longtail salamander. For years they had eaten off the wealth of the glacier as their family had lived in the hilly section of town and had grown a vegetable garden in the backyard in the rich topsoil. Marbled salamander. {lipsmack} Or they like to think about the scientist who claimed that in terms of patterns of heating and cooling on the Earth's surface, the Earth should be entering a new Ice Age. Massasauga. It is long overdue, he claimed. Mooneye. Yet according to him this Ice Age has been perhaps counteracted by human climactic interference. Mossy Valvata. So maybe we were better off, maybe better fire than ice, although who knew what gods or demons were being angered and what they would do with their anger. Mottled Duskywing. They were not scientists and could not figure out w- what to blame or what the long term consequences might be, and even if they were scientists they might not be able to figure this out. Mountain Brook Lamprey. They made no claim to answers, they just noticed things. Mud sunfish. And the more they read the more confused they became. Mud turtle. And at this moment in their lives there was more to read than ever before, and it was easier than ever before to require it as it came through their computers. And all the time the computers had newer and better search engines making more and more specific information easier to find. New England Cottontail. They knew there were certain enemies in this story, such as Bush with his refusal to sign the Kyoto Accord, and certain industries. Northeastern Beach Tiger+ Beetle. But they also knew that the Kyoto Accord was too little, too late. Northern Cricket Frog. They also knew that they didn't want to let excessive information paralyze them. Northern Goshawk. Or excessive guilt. Northern Harrier. So they felt they had to say that they # and they felt that they had to say that they knew that they were in part responsible for it, whatever it was that was causing this, because they lived in the place that used the largest amount of stuff most likely to cause this warming. Northern Wild Monk's Hood. They lived among those who used the most stuff up, who burned the most stuff, who produced the most stuff, and other things like that, Olympia Marble And even if they tried to live their lives with less stuff than others, they still benefitted and were a part of the system that produced all this stuff and because of this they had a hard time figuring out how to move beyond their own personal renewed commitment to denial of stuff and yet their awareness of how they benefitted daily from being a part of the system that used up the most stuff.
