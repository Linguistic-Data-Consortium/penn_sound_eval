Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_Xavier-Univ_10-27-09	0.12	415.694	Moving forward and across My brain cells are crispy tonight Silence A toolkit {lipsmack} Write about it The words come with letters pre inscribed  The letters are secure in their variously circumscribing words. The words represent a kind of packaged application of signification Letters are elements in a toolkit for spelling words. Think about it. Train whistle leaves us speechless Imagine letters. Imagine letters breaking the boundaries of words. Imagine words breaking open their envelopes, never to be the same broadly speaking into an eventually undifferentiated state Each man is the child of his deeds, and each woman is the child of her deeds All words are lures, all dreams, means. Some meanings lost, others mostly ((draws)) the slim files of random data fragged and tossed. The lessons scattered at bus stops. Forgotten angles on past lives. Situations not right. Solo entries onto barren planes, suggesting mighty stories savored late at night. Collapsing ((in)) piles on hotel room floors, circulating high above commercial districts. Emptying out into freeway sounds at night. Standing for thoughts never uttered, eyes shut tight against material operations going on as if on their own Next to nothing the space inside a lowercase ~E You could set up shop there We breathe through these holes, look out through these portals, language clothes us in a foam Its minute bubbles admit light, give off heat combined and pack a wallop We live in this vast complex built out of units comprising next to nothing Cascading granularity moves us forward and to the right (({lipsmack})) Zeroing in on # a rhythm of speech that moves from heart to heart, zeroing in on and in the moment unable to hold onto it, the suspension a kind of start, way classic in its sundry appeal. That accordion way of life, people sitting everywhere, to walk in and see all those people {lipsmack} not even ((Eye)) stumbles and falls, becomes an empty underscore, italicizing nothing Hundreds of thousands of email messages, gone forever, deeply buried in unwound time Flickering, I'll get right on it, Get it right, and  That's not what I heard Reading by hand Writing in pencil lasts longer Pick something up and try to figure out how it works, say a digital camera. Consult the manual. Writing is the same way, reading by hand But I'm so lazy, don't want to worry. I stay alone at night Writer has one subject It is the act of being alone The sky is brilliant, huge cumulus clouds mass above the lake Writing goes its own way You have to supply the synthesis The= sound= of= car= doors= closing= The sound of car doors closing ((and)) voices from the street. An engine starts up, revving to pull away, down to the corner and gone In the silence that follows train whistle sounds Who listens? Then jet noise overhead Who stays behind to report And who in some other time and place, quietly waits to hear a word {lipsmack} Up front Writing in place, the illusion of movement meets the illusion of standing still. A philosophical encounter with rhythm Counting time in a forest of symbols. Batter up. Throwing a few change ups, whatever's working that night. Replacing Mark Redman as part of the double switch. This isn't about me. This is for you men, you women out there The train comes into the picture Picture a group of men walking along beside it Later, Clint drives the train through a saloon Jet noise trails away, going to great lengths, riding up front on the handlebars This train Driving that train the words book You stare glassy eyed at the onrushing terrain Ain't no more ((came.)) The essentials scatter all over the parking lot The rhythm of the rails, cows disappear out the window. You'll never know (({lipsmack})) how much I love you You'll never know how much I care Light winds teasing the upper branches The silver rings The medium blue topaz spoke to her and when she looked more closely, displayed its laughter The theoreticians of empire tripping over the symmetries of their own semantics The entrepreneurs paddling like eager surfers, vying for position near the crest of the next wave The voices on the street at night calling out to one another The athletes crouching on their benches, half following the action, awaiting their turns The young mothers, bearing their children on their hips at poolside The thin old woman in tight jeans tightrope walking along the curb of the driveway, showing off Don't want this train ride to end When you get to the end you want to hit restart Or as, when kids playing guns, we used to say when shot I'm a new man The books work ((That's that.)) And then I'd like to close with something new {lipsmack} um and as some of you know um I've been uh participating in a po- # a group project with nine other poets who were active in the San Francisco poetry scene in the seventies {lipsmack} We've been writing about that time and uh we started it almost ten years ago now on the internet as a correspondence. And then about three, four years ago we started finalizing some of the work and putting it out a- as a series of books and uh we've now done # Number nine just came out. uh We've done nine and we've got one to go It's called The Grand Piano um {lipsmack} named after a coffee house in San Francisco where a lot of poetry readings happened at that time. And uh as I said, there are ten people involved. uh Each uh volume has ten pieces, one by each poet. Now a lot of it is um pretty straight uh memoir with recollections and stuff but uh they vary a lot from person to person and from= from issue to issue. But um this is the last one that= that I completed and actually uh I wrote it um in about two thousand and it was # a version of it was published in Chain Magazine by Jena Osman and Julianna Spahr um But when it came time to sort of finalize it for the book I added a bunch more stuff, sort of in- um inserting it between existing paragraphs.
