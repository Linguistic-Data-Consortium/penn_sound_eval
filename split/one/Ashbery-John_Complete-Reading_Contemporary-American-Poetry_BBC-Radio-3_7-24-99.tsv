But you can't do that, he hasn't even finished his spinach, urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment. But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment succumbed to a strange new hush. Actually, it's quite pleasant here, thought the Sea Hag. If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don't mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over, She scratched, one dug pensively, But Wimpy is such a country bumpkin, always burping like that. Minute at first the thunder soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder, the color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched his balls, It sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country. This next poem must date from about nineteen seventy four when I at last just {NSV} could no longer escape teaching and= and began teaching uh poetry to students at Brooklyn College and found myself immediately assailed by their questions about what is poetry and why is this a poem and why do you say this isn't and uh what is poetry anyway and # so this called What is Poetry but the title has no question mark {NSV} And uh I don't think it was probably very helpful to the students but it was part of my finally beginning to think about what is poetry myself, having done it for a long time without ever having asked myself that question. And it ends as so many of my poems do or= or rather {NSV} they include lines of b- bits of conversation overheard very often when walking down the streets of New York where you hear rather peculiar things sometimes What Is Poetry The medieval town, with frieze of boy scouts from Nagoya? The snow that came when we wanted it to snow? Beautiful images? Trying to avoid ideas as in this poem? But we go back to them as to a wife, leaving the mistress we desire? Now they will have to believe it as we believe it. In school all the thought got combed out. What was left was like a field Shut your eyes, and you can feel it for miles around. Now open them on a thin, vertical path It might give us, what, ((s-)) some flowers soon It's= it's the last line It might give us, what, some flowers soon, that I overheard a boy saying to a girl in  Brentano's Bookshop in New York and decided to keep it. (({breath})) uh The next one uh At North Farm was written in uh the early eighties and although North Farm obviously could be anywhere and I don't explain in the poem ((wha-)) what suggested it It was # it's actually the name given in a translation I read of the Kalevala, the Finnish folk epic of placed called # I think it # Pohjola. I don't know how the Finnish pronunciation # place described as being near hell but not exactly in it and always with the epithet, {NSV} Looming and Prosperous North Farm At North Farm Somewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you, at incredible speed, traveling day and night, Through blizzards and desert heat, Across torrents, through narrow passes. But will he know where to find you recognize you when he sees you, Give you the thing he has for you? Hardly anything grows here, Yet the granaries are bursting with meal, the sacks of meal piled to the rafters. The streams run with sweetness, fattening fish. Birds darken the sky. Is it enough that the dish of milk is set out at night, that we think of him sometimes, sometimes and always, with mixed feelings? Well, this is a fairly recent poem of the past few years. Don't know exactly when Called At First I Thought I Wouldn't Say Anything About It (({NSV})) and uh I can't think of anything I was thinking about when I wrote it, so I won't (({NSV})) introduce it except uh I see it has the phrase, The unruly sun, obviously a uh theft from John Dunne. At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it But then I thought keeping quiet about it might appear even ruder At first I thought I had died and gone to heaven But that scapegrace the unruly son informed me otherwise I'm in my heavyset pants, and find this occupation of beekeeper charming thought I have yet to meet my first bee We don't know if I get to keep the hat and veil Too hot, he said, Too hot for everything, he so caring, so mundane to have you onboard Bulgarian choirs everywhere stood up and sang the song of the rent. It was lovely Now, I shall take a short vacation, ((proof)) that I am needed here Nobody wants my two cents anymore, I believe To some it was like skating in summer a small turret perched over the lake. It exploded That's the way I feel about people taking me out to some nice repast and afterwards you go home and go over everything that was stated I prefer flowers and breathing. The next poem is called No Longer Very Clear and uh well it's no longer very clear to me when I wrote it or what I was thinking about when I wrote it. However I= uh I could tell you that the public radio station in= um in New York City, ~WNYC had a uh benefit uh concert and they asked me to contribute a poem ((uh)) which would be set to music by a number of contemporary composers, or at any rate they would write music suggested by it if they weren't actually setting the words. And uh Philip Glass uh Morton Gould, Tania Leon were among the uh composers and one of them was uh the composer Joan Tower who is actually a= a friend of mine and= and colleague at Bard College where she teaches and ((uh)) she took two of the lines and uh wrote piano pieces that she says are based on and then she's going to do another one to make three, but she hasn't done it yet	Subject
