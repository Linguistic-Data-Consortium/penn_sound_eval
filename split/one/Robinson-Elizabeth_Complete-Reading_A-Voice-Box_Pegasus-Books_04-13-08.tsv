It's called Crow and Robin {breath} {lipsmack} Nearby, I hear the sound of wood planks clunking against each other and through the trees comes the clack of hammers sometimes a buzzsaw The man laughs and says, Have you ever murdered a man His coworker makes no reply The man begins to sing a song, but stops, interrupting himself with his own laughter (({lipsmack})) At home, I sit at the kitchen table and look out through the window at the neighbor's garden I think about you Rather, I imagine that I am you What would you make of the ragged peonies+ and why the neighbor # why hasn't the neighbor cut them back as they die? From inside your body, how do peonies smell? I am embarrassed by the limits of imagination, that is, how my desire fails as empathy and settles into voyeurism Have you ever deadheaded a peony I want to know not how the old felted browning petals feel but how they feel to your fingertips I wonder if I'd ask a stranger, as you must ultimately be, a question arising out of genuine curiosity I wonder if ((I'd)) dare to trespass into my neighbor's flowerbed and cut down her ugly, used up flowers Across the street Griffin+ Griffin is three and a half He walks to the edge of the driveway holding a bouncy ball He aims carefully, and then sets the ball down to roll it The ball rolls evenly Griffin's one year old sister totters carefully toward her brother on her new walking legs The ball connects with her shins, bringing her to her knees Her face bounces down, and then off the ball Griffin retrieves the ball and walks back to the edge of the driveway, starting again Griffin, honey, calls ((a)) babysitter. Griffin. I thought it was funny, ((but)) Outside my window on the second floor, two birds squabble One is a robin, and the other looks to be a crow, big and aggressive The robin is getting beat up, but stands its ground A huge gust of wind causes the bough to move from due north to due east The birds rotate before my eyes, parallel with me The wind carries the package of itself on the arguing bird voices until a pedestrian walks by and the crow is startled, slides off the bough and goes away I wanted the crow to be ashamed, to leave the branch ashamed that it had forced itself on another bird's home Then I realized that I am the crow and you are the robin, and a sense of adoration and admiration spreads through me like a new version of the weather The crow comes back again and again, and I hear the raised voices of the birds merging with the bigger, agitated voice of the wind Is it really wrong to look for evidence that will prove what you want to believe anyway? I often find what I'm looking for on a chain of continuity, the leading to or following from Here in the sequence of reason, proof that things may be connected off kilter without ((there are)) realizing the link This morning, as I was listening to the radio, I heard this story {lipsmack} A semi truck is pulling out of a gas station driveway Just as it pulls out onto the street, a man in a wheelchair rolls in front of it and gets stuck in the grill of the truck The truck driver drives four miles at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour, completely unaware of his front loaded passenger When the truck finally stops, the wheelchair is detached from the truck and its occupant is unharmed He describes the experience as, Quite a ride. That was on ~NPR too, I will say Could there be more to the crow than its obnoxiousness? Doesn't it too have a right to be hungry, to need shelter? I watch it trying to get its glossy head into the bird feeder meant for finches and sparrows. Very smart If I were the stand in for the crow, then could I convince someone to love me? I imagine watching you watch the crow, your good humor but your sense ultimately that this bird is not subtle A pest, you think, it should blow away in a summery gust Coming home from work, I see my young neighbor Griffin running up the empty sidewalk looking back over his shoulder As though, I think with amusement there was someone following him I am raking up the fallen mess of leaves and sticks in the yard when I notice that the woman next door is carrying sticks and branches out to the curb We both continue without acknowledging each other After a while, I see the man across the street sawing off a half broken branch from a tree, and then that another neighbor is silently raking up debris from the storm Far down the street, some day laborers are talking animatedly in Spanish Otherwise, there are no human voices In the middle of the night, I wake up to terrified screaming One creature preys upon another And after the screams, quite near, the wounded animal takes up a desperate snoring, breathing I turn on the porch light and the breathing stops then starts again, more irregular I can't see what is out there, even though the sound of it is so sharp that it's in my nostrils and on my tongue I wish you were here to comfort me But I make my fear correct itself. I would be you, the self at a loss The invisible hand that rests on the shoulder of its own body, guiding it	Subject
