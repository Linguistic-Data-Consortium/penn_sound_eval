Not grown up into her own real self but small. A doll of dolls of dolls, with the skin of a baby Not a baby, but someone looking near to six or seven, yet the size and shape of someone whom a mother could still carry, curled and nestled. A cosy infant of about eight months, which is why I call this my soul And I spoke to her that night and through the day Two barrettes and a scrunchie were at issue, the way it's always something simple, a pretext for feelings too large to speak of Yet when I remembered this insight, it was way past the event. Thus coming far after I had needed the helpful decoding to what this then had meant and therefore felt confusion, bitterness and curiosity. Why did you not tell me you needed them to swim, or to be on the team to play soccer or whatever? Everything, traveling backwards and behindhand Was it too late now to buy or find those pretty clasps and bands to give my soul? Why didn't you tell me what you needed from the beginning I wanted everything to give us satisfactions and connections. What could have occurred between us. Instead there were silences, repressions, and symbolic sniping gestures Yet when I carried you, you nestled the way they do, and milky soft against me, and you carried me. I looked precisely like you, or you looked like you. Those lively eyes and dark curls and spunky disposition, and I was moved and critical. Was I any good a mother? I had thought I was a better mother, she, a soul You will have, I was told or said, to share the guest room as a crowd of people is already there and I laid her down to rest with them There are dancers and readers and those who would not be satisfied and with you are people you once knew and some are dead Attend them through the many tales and songs that each might offer others or invent The room is small, so work it out They will wait for you as you for them, with yes and no, with back and forth, the here and there, the then and now Their modes of folding and their modes of caring I was struck by this lightning as much as she and I carried the soup quietly to all the beds, for all through the house it was dark as it would have had to be. And darker the movement, stair to stair There were many there to feed We must all feed all the living, then the dead And I, it seemed, had taken on one task Don't spill it I won't. A vow. Was I alone? I did not seem to be Though this was hard to fathom when I felt the red shadow of our bloodied world's insistent presence in the moon's eclipse darkening night And then the moon slid slowly back with full, suffusing light Yet this part of the work remains closest to darkness The knowledge of yearning will not be complete There is no there. It's all degrees of here ((Cannot)) touch them whom we are marked by But they are palpable and enter this place Be nomadic, nomad Wander with the wanderers, yet safe in the room There is at once too much and much too little Wait it out The bit of ugly, the glitch, the torn, the sweeper, the tender, the constant reminder that things are being made, unmade and tended You are now one part of all of this You will be it, help it, answer and feed that surface of cries, chirps You will call out, live in empathy, let the agony be comfort it Reject the hole that someone claims is rule A hole, a line, a hold, a lie, a hope, a hype will slide you through this most dangerous spot Resist only rectitudes, resist the crazed and driven knowers find and replace Though the mechanism to depict this is called	Subject
