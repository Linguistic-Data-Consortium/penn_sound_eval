There's a promised land, right in the body but the land is overrun by creatures who feel that someone must get the trains to run on time. What day is it? It's ((moon)) day. It's ((land)) day. It's sun. I don't even know what day it is and I don't give a flying fuck. My life disintegrates and reintegrates. In the process I lose a tiny bit of my integrity. Every revolution cells die, regenerate. You and I are the formulation. We are the cosmic in between. No time for self pity. Only time for ((song.)) This is the song of the world. The world is death. These guys don't believe that and neither do I but the world is death. The many forms of death. Defeated death, resigned death, surprised death, slow death, anguished death, searing death, blinding death, lightning death, delicious death, long-awaited death, sleeping death, laughing death. But then again the world is a puppy dog. The world is a ((colt)) falling on its face. The world is a tiny human at birth. Eyes closed, crying for food and warmth, reaching out, ((betrayed)) in total trust. The world is shit. Piss. Puke on your face. The world is putrefaction, decay, ecstatic ((cum,)) roses, mangoes, magical birds and their songs all in the same place. The world is a pregnant woman, afternoon walk down a palm shaded seaside road, the wind whipping ((white)) across the hissing sea. Taking it easy. Taking it easy with my man by my side, how much longer do I got to wait. The world is ants in your sugar ((and)) flies in your beer. It's mosquitos, sunburn, and stomachaches and bulldozers smashing down ((on)) audibly screaming trees, to make houses, to make paper, to flash ideas across an imaginary entity spinning through cloudy space. The world's a newspaper printed in technicolor. You better believe it. You didn't make it but love it or leave it. The world's a ripoff. Burn. All your dreams come true and nightmares too. It's a pretty good joke and it's on you. So ((hats off,)) if you don't forget to laugh at yourself even if you got to laugh to keep from crying. It's a pretentious project. A beautiful blunder. A terrible mistake. It's watched over by avenging angels who drink too much and lots of times come to work in a bad mood. ((It's)) a police state. Habeas corpus has been suspended and the court of appeals has a backlog six centuries too long. But don't worry because it's your mama giving you a pat on the head and a big kiss. It's sugar. It's ((the best.)) It's satisfaction, anticipation, fulfillment, and rest. And I think I'll take a little rest. Okay. Before we continue I just want to read a poem I wrote, and I think it's very apropos, called a good thing where she could steal but ((she)) could not rob. {laugh} Sometimes I'm afraid to read a poem I've written or let others read it for fear they'll slap a tag on my forehead, tout suite. It will glow neon and blink her poetry is just like ((blank's.)) I wouldn't like that. ((Or)) someone had written that poem in their lifetime so I can't in mine. Mark Twain said it ((best.)) What a good thing Adam had. When he said a good thing, he knew nobody had said it before. Gentlemen. Would you like to continue? This is called in four parts. A person can lie around on an uncrowded beach and when too much peace and quiet gets on his nerves he can always get dressed and tour Israel. Mayor Frank X. Graves today ordered the arrest of Allen Ginsberg if the police could prove that the poet smoked marijuana while looking at the Passaic Falls yesterday. The Jewish Memorial Hospital's junior league were given second annual ((discotheque)) benefits Sunday at the round table. William Carlos Williams, the Paterson, New Jersey physician, was a strong and vigorous poet who spoke in the American idiom. It's true. uh {laugh} I'm not very (()) don't get excited. I have to read a very serious ((work here)) but (()) I can't find one. (()) What, these people out in= in= in ((national)) audience? This is called um # it doesn't matter what this is called, this is a series of aphorisms which um are geared to inform you and there's a coda which uh informs the aphorisms. The front is hiding the rear. The heart of a man is not as great as an amphitheater.  ((Spinoza)) is the one who threw a pass to (()) ((Spinoza.)) These are from the French, by the way. {laugh} There is no death, there is only dissolution. Love of hate is totally great. Me, I disguise myself as a man in order to laugh. I've always loved a serious ((jack off)) scene. Infantile paralysis is the beginning of wisdom. Everything is poison except our ((meat.)) Flowers and candy make my teeth ache. The most beautiful and most noble of men are queer. Mystical explanations are dopey and (()) fingers the thunder to learn so that we have left everything aside but not as a ((cloud mind)) steps beside the slow reservoir. Now it is all of this, the pink bulbs included which means we have protected ourselves by forgetting all we were dealt. Walking up Second Avenue in the heat, the waves of glamour obscuring the nature of the beings we are but the cool air makes you say, What the fuck? Give in to the total sensuality that is your big head, your big ass, your big crotch, your ((spine)) bouncing around to the rhythm of your walk.	Speaker1
