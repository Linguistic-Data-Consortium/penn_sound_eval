Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09	0.098	487.866	I had a question about ((for Laura)) Smith about her talk and it's a follow up question in relationship to what John Retalack um said about the some of the problems with ((rupture rapture)) or ((uh)) the troubling nature of ((fusing)) those two when you're looking and thinking about not just the relationship between bodies, the violent ((studies of)) bodies, the history of bodies in relationship to one another, particularly since you were doing your piece on ((Michaela)) Oliver and since she's specifically invoking the issue of= of not just the issue of slavery but the instruments of torture done to bodies through slavery. um uh (({NSV})) I don't know # you know um {cough} Saidiya Hartman Scenes of Subjection in which she talks about kind of Mhm. the # not just the kind of {laugh} rupture in relationship to bodies, but the pleasure branded in= the= in the # in var- # the dangerous forms of pleasure. And I'm wondering if you could {cough} Mhm. ((Right there.)) speak to how obviously you couldn't do that in a very short presentation but how, because I know this is part of your work on a larger project how does your work deal with when you put those things together in conversation, how does it deal with those # with the troubling dimensions while at the same time not abandoning your interest in exploring Oliver's work in this way I mean I= I= I think that my answer to that and= and my response to the um the link between rupture and # I'm sorry, rapture and um its religious connotations, um are= are= are the same and= and I think that this is what I'm so interested in, um in what I see as Oliver's repurposing of the idea of rapture um {lipsmack} it so embodied in her version. And= I= and I think it secularized # and= I= and I= s- I see this I- I've been seeing this across um such a lot of queer and trans work (({lipsmack})) Mhm. that I'm seeing these um ver- very radical trends, ((bodily)) identifications that are um ((varyingly)) located um very raced, very gendered, ((uh)) very specific um very aware of boundaries while they transgress um And= and I # and that's intensely paradoxical. ((uh)) But I think that and= and= I= and I= I do think that there's this um crux about trans ((illness)) that that work is thinking about and thinking about um um so- so- something that feels very paradoxical between locatedness and relationality {cough} Mhm. But I do think that the metaphor of= of rapture um gets local, it gets secular, and it gets embodied Now, I wanted to notice something and um maybe have some people comment on it. I was uh curious. In my notes on Joan's talk, which may not have been the segue in Joan's talk I have written down, alter- Alterity within the self and the next thing I= I have written down is reciprocal alterity Now having (({laugh})) re- # alterity within the self has been commented on by= by Nathalie # Nathanael, Body Stuffed Full of Mind, suggests Alterity by ((Trish)) including in the last comment about um a ((trance)) like amenity going towards transcendence too solve the problem of the alterity within the self and in by ((Reynaldo)) in a way, in one of the acquaintances on ((leather and fishnet)) um a- and so I was wondering how when you have alterity within the self which is patent and like been played out and= and commented on one also can produce a reciprocal alterity with the other. Because it seems as if the players have multiplied. Hm. Mhm. That is if every self has alterities of various kinds and the ethical goal is reciprocal= alteri- # reciprocal alterity it's # there's been a= a um # um to morph into a ((polyneme)) # a polyvalent space, ((this)) is very very interesting And that's what I had noticed in the terms of= a= r- of a relationship with ((mom)) Hm. ((do this.)) uh A lot of things need to be said and I wondered whether if anyone else noticed it, they would like to comment on it That is the ((ample problem with)) simple alterity when um one is ((fissured)) into ((writing praise)) um Just the small mathematical question, you know. um Subject to other # subject at uh= uh alterity within the subject and subject ((Right.)) other abject and= I= th- and I think that you know with regards to the ((Levinas)) in question of you know, the feminine and= and the other uh and that's then becoming confounded with women and the question of whether women that occupy the masculine relation to the feminine  then sort of framing what is left out of that ((as)) actually # ((and)) in between a sort of um uh uh destroyed ground which might be the enemy, the Palestinian, for Levinas uh ((it)) might be uh= uh ((Huh.)) it= it might be the unmarked # the unreclaimable body, and that # and so for me the ethical question had less to do with um the constituent of misrecognition between our own alterity and others which is an asymmetrical landscape, and= and we're negotiating. But uh the further violence of uh an unmarked terrain which enables even plotting self other. ((Hm. Yeah,)) (()) ((Mhm. Yeah.)) So putting the third in is really putting a third's attrition within Yeah. Mhm. which is actually not= not a dialectic but is # it's not the= the ((dia-)) # but it's some other space. That's very interesting Yeah, ((a little bit. Yeah. {cough})) Yeah. ((Mhm.)) ((Yeah, that's he's loved for that time.)) ((Mhm.)) ((It's great.)) {laugh} {laugh} um No, I= d- I don't Have any disagreement with what's just been said. I= I think that the moment one recognizes ((an alterity within one's self, one is)) ((Uh-huh.)) recognizing the reciprocity of ((all)) alterity, because alterity is not only about others outside of oneself And I do think that um uh the vectors of alterities go in= in many directions. um That= that in itself is= is not a very um full statement. um But= it= but it leads to the question or it raises questions of um the nature of practices within a um uh uh a worldscape {NSV} where you can be mapping reciprocal alterities rather than mapping less than um alterities in ((the #)) ((Mhm. {laugh} Yeah. Mhm.)) (()) ((Mhm.)) I have a question about that ((now thing. I think I'm going to #)) it makes a lot  of sense that that is how  you get there but I think a- an ((awful lot to say)) is possible to recognize ((witness within themselves)) and not relate to # still be able to ((like)) to the other and= not= and not relate. You know, not That's right. not move in that way that we= we # ((like)) we have the ideal ((epidural)) relationship. So one can say you know, I recognize this ((me)) and that ((me)) and not you You {laugh} know? {laugh} Yeah. ((Yeah, for sure.)) For sure. ((Yeah, they're not supposed to get down.)) I love that thing, yeah. {laugh} ((Valerie.)) {laugh} No, I think it's # again I think it's one of those necessarily but not sufficient ((men. They're not=)) Hm. not verbs. {laugh} that= that you= you certainly can recognize other than what's within yourself and you'd be blind to others. Period. um But in order to um begin a dynamic of ((reciprocation))	Unknown1
