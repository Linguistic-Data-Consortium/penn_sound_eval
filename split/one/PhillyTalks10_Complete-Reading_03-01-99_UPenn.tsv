Going onto one knee with a string, ladles for cheesemaking hang in ((a)) casa ((ficcio))  From one generation to the next, going onto one knee with a spoon. Furniture fabric depicting the farmworker's struggle, going onto one knee with a spoon. The people will neither read nor write, going onto one knee with a spoon. Inheriting seemingly ghostlike qualities, going onto one knee with a spoon. Going onto one knee by sedition, the troubled boy is a laughingstock, a world lit only by fire, the destruction of letters by fire (({lipsmack})) Going onto one knee by sedition, picking through ruins was drying their hands out.

Orbiting circles with brown ~Xs, farther off pedestrians make parallel lines and collapse into distance or becoming one of several skylines in charcoal or finger paint At zero hour an Earth unrights itself, becomes an indelible number line counting backward to embrace its new horizon, indefatigable zero, the high lit window, a person tethered to a desk, this city and its outline, its rivers, its cemeteries Invisible, the orchard keeper's mansion is everywhere. The heart becomes one last stone of an existing growth in a squatter's earth. Thus in persons and in plants also, stone and the brilliant element of fire into the helix and throughout the electrics salt Beyond this image, decomposing desire and as always with a mouth, there is earth because it calls, fear is redundant and that animal sound in late night is only its own speech becoming one, becoming air. Books outlasting buildings outlast sweat, ((and)) the broken human form of body labors, whose face is the same as another. Nothing spoke for itself. Every action implied a rhetoric so it may recognize itself. To teach, to celebrate virtue, to persuade by example, to lead the court to its ideal self through wonder, same page, same fable trajectory. A window. The young father dreaming. A hand, a face, a feeling. It was a sound he heard The way of earthworms and coffins of dead infants, cobwebs and deformity, of windows and the children they expose, the signs they carry, shame	Subject
