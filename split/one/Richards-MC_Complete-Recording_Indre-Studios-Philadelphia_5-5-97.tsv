Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97	0.95	499.71	A big evergreen tree stands outside my window Its roots mumble under the surface A long concrete divider steps three at a time Sky cloudy and heavy Squeezing a thin layer of light against the city The first red leaves of an otherwise green shrub {breath} The sisters are gone from the convent The dancers are gone from the hill Morning has come to its noon The hide of the tree has grown rough scales The trunk bends its hip to the left and shakes its disheveled branches to a secret music of release The trunk bends its hip to the left and shakes its disheveled branches to a secret music of release Now there's another poem about the morning Morning Prayer, it's called. Yes. I'd like to {breath} read this Morning Prayer ((since it)) kind of ((call)) for help. {breath} {breath} {breath} Morning Prayer {breath} Help me, I murmur, As if I knew t- to whom I speak or what I'm asking for Sitting in my nightgown for coffee by the window Walking up Third Avenue Waiting {NSV} in my studio by the clay bins (({lipsmack})) Oh, help me And sometimes I hold my breasts and a stronger pulse beats upwards as if my words are both prayer and answer Help me As if somewhere a great ear listens to our morning roar An orbit swings open And the spirit of love, like a sharp bite of acid etches the ground and I can lift my foot Help me to feel your presence in grain and grape Not to wander as if lost when I am not lost Sweeten my breast from the fantasy I am not loved nor touched enough For ecstasy breathes at the window where I wait leaps towards me in little gasps of the cock's trembling comb, the hen's groan the maple catkins hanging like green teats, the dawn's pallor I am ((stroked)) by the darting dapple Hopkins praised (({lipsmack})) Help me to feel faithfully your presence riding under the surface in a mighty, unwasted current {breath} {NSV} {breath} You were at # Jasper, you were asking me about Florida {breath} Here's a poem called, Your Name, Florida. {cough} {breath} Yes, and it is just about that way with the ocean too The song rippling along, and the sea in stitches, nipping and tucking (({lipsmack})) And the river, yes it is that Indian lagoon, a broad leaf of blue A vine, narrowing and straying There is that bird place, stuffed, stuffed with wings, necks, heads and outcry and a thousand settle in for the night's dark needs Oh, those elbows of birds, pouchy gullets, slow motion legs and necks like a shepherd's crook What Egyptian mystery hangs by a feather on this egret here? And what alchemical right bleeds in the pelican's breast? (({breath})) Yes, that white ruffle of the horizon line and the ginger sand The pine poking itself outward in green fringe (({lipsmack})) Hibiscus double yolk and yoga palms stretched like flying fish {breath} breathing deep the shoreline fills to the clouds. The cliff and ((soul)) drinks in the gale and the song Heliotrope, sun turned, sun turning, sun how you do do it here, yes, in this land of swelling air Water, fruit and flowers {lipsmack} This place of fruitful swelling Yes, that's what it means Your name Florida (({breath})) Now let's dry out a bit with a piece called How to Rake Water. {breath} Begins with, Dry water The pool of tines through sand rakes water into waves Dry water pools into dust Take the stream of time and rake it into hours Let the dry flowing future slake the Earth's thirst Water wings whip the great shapes of flying and rake the buoyant water into circles {breath} I am this water {breath} and this rake combing my ocean into piles of stone Water {breath} spread thin turns into rain, holds within banks the cup of seas, runs down the mountain's chin and foams in the green beard of trees	Subject
