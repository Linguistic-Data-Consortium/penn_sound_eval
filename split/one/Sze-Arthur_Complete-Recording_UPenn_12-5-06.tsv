Sze-Arthur_Complete-Recording_UPenn_12-5-06	0.281	382.524	What caps on teal water, a few freighters zigzag down from the Black Sea Sunlight flares at the edges of leaves. Heat ripples up from the noon strin- # street and from rusted car tops The salt in the air stings my eyes. I lift a latch, step into a patio, bird of paradise in bloom But approaching the window, I find peeled paint Cobwebs. It's dingy inside. I turn Wade into sleep Do as you're told, scumsucker. You're the reason there are hydrogen bombs, yelled at the postal worker behind the counter It ((leopards)) the body Cringes at strangled anteaters and raccoons hanging in the market It ((leopards)) the body Wakes to pulverized starfish in his shoes It ((leopards)) the body Disinterred, a man and woman sealed for one thousand eight hundred fifty five years under jade plaque stitched with gold thread It ((leopards)) the body ((Winstead)) hundreds of cicadas stridulating in the umbrella pines It ((leopards)) the body Place the blackbird with a red gash in the trash bin It ((leopards)) the body Catches lamb shank in the smoke It ((leopards)) the body Recovers a red tulip from inside a corkscrew dream It ((leopards)) the body Combust when the candlelight touch It ((leopards)) the body Cars clunk as they drive off the ferry at ((Chenaga Lay)) You walk up the steps and find a double peristyle with a deep entrance porch filled with columns At the base of the columns is an octagonal set of carved dragons, mermaids and palmettes You turn Stride down a dark and narrow vaulted ramp that emerges with blinding light into a large hall open to the sky A continuous frieze on three walls has a central acanthus flanked by griffins and lyres At the far end roped off by string is the foundation of an inner temple with steps that drop to a spring When you walk toward the sanctum and look back you see stairs to the platform of epiphanies at the rear You gaze up to the top of a sixty five foot column, step up to the cord but can't get near enough to see if the spring is dry or wet You hunger for insight into the precarious nature of becoming, gaze at the woman you love, ((wet)) at how passion is water from a spring realize that yesterday, exhausted you are not going to come this far. But today, having come you have sunlight in your hands Because one stirred the entrails of a goat immolated on an altar Because a magpie flicks tail feathers Because blood ((fresh+)) tulips bloomed on the walkway Because one speaks without fear of reprisal Because a man crushed in the debris of aluminum doors, steering wheel, dashboard, shivered windshield, bleeds and moans Because he had to visualize black petunias in order to spot black trumpets on the forest floor Because he slowly bites the back of her neck Because an eagle glides over the courtyard with outstretched wings Because a woman fasted, chewed laurel leaves, swayed in noon heat, stammered, The here is always beginning Because she brushes her hair across his eyelids Because bells tinkle around the necks of goats Because the ruins of this moment are chalk white dust in your hands Because a grain of sand, lodged Because loss is a seed that germinates into all things are full of Gods Because a circle opens in all directions Nine purple irises bloom in a triangular glass vase A pearl forms in an oyster She folds a prayer and ties it to a green cryptomeria branch Threaded sponges are hanging in the doorway A slug crawls along a railroad tie A double bass upstairs suffused the house with longing Silk tree leaflets fold up when touched Waking out of her coma she vowed, I will dip my hands in ink and drag them across white, mulberry paper A hummingbird sipping at a columbine darted off Red mullets thrash in the water ((when cast)) to the end of time She wore gold hooped earrings with her black dress Urn shards were incorporated into the stone walls of houses They swam in the Aegean blossoming yellow forsythia is the form and pressure of the hour. Thank you. ((Thank you.))	Subject
