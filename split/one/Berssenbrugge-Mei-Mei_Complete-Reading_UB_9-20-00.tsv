A girl sings along without knowing the words and enters your memory. That there's no present of what will happen to her is your expectation. Everyone becomes great in proportion to a singer's spurious expectations. Like so many good mistakes. Parachute on the desert ((blue)) with light. Eleven sheep head to head in a circle, asleep. Enjoyment and substance in real time involve clearings about which pivot opaque zones. Real is a span of visibility in as much as your flesh is not chaotic of a contingency. The real thing substitutes for another who's not representable as he gathers up parachute and delivery. If I stay here and you mean something, the part in common is disjunct from what you mean. Like my hands touching that you're telepathic means nothing. You facts, you can't know which still work in the connections of my experience. A rock in rain, distributing water along texture is my response to experience. Inasmuch as your flesh is an invisible interplay of disjunction needed for identity, flesh is texture. Our meeting occurs near a hill you climb every day to water transplanted iris. Why don't you let others do that? Although I do not wish to separate from him, now, due to faults of compound phenomena being demonstrated, it seems he will disappear from my sight and hearing. The beauty of his song derives from the fact it represents something to someone. Any family that's concentrated in so far as it represents something may be taken for someone. Wherever there's waiting is this transference. The danger is you'll be deceived by the metonymy of my tender feeling, so light and multiple. You go to pick up the child after school. You remain a few moments talking with a teacher beside the loom. Why are you telling her this? Glory, formless substance, circular dawn. Like a child's drawing of stars or snowflakes and lines. Each line connects. So it's the same star falling loop to loop. And each line belongs to each star. My friend, the white rabbit, little mouse, squirrel, impatient, shaking off their clothes. I wanted to write a= a poem for a long time about um the fertile area of the margin. But then when I wrote it, it was called Nest. And um it's in= in five parts. My mother tongue, Chinese, has an immemorial history before me. I was inserted into it. A motive for my language. I learned it naturally, filling it with intentions, and will leave it without intent for other children. My mother and I speak a local language and sometimes our mother tongue as in my dream with its intent. What do you intend in changing the mother tongue of my daughter? Compassion, not being ill. Sleep  in which she resonates depth like a bell. Loving the wind is equivalent to intention as rhetorical surface like writing a diary on her skin. Non comprehension tips ambivalent matter as if there were two of us here. One is (({foreign})). One is mother tongue. Her matter inserted. A motive is always somewhere else. Exiting one language, another without intent translated as heart. I want to tell you what's difficult to admit, that I left home. Change of mother tongue between us activates an immune system, margin where dwelling and travel are not distinct. The artifacts throw themselves toward light without becoming signification. Telling you is not an edge of the light. There's no margin of a shadow to imply interior. In my childhood house was a deep porch covered with vines. Look past our silhouette to silhouettes like shadows of guests arriving in the bright yard. Light in the next room falls on her as she bends to kiss you. Skylight pours down then covers the mud wall like cloth. I observe the lighted feel that seems to hang in space in front of me. Speaking, not filling in. A surface intent is like a cabinet of artifacts. Comparison coexisting with incongruity. My origin is a linguistic surface like a decorated wall. No little houses, at dusk yellow lights coming on physical mute. Its significance is received outside hearing, decorating simply by opening the view. Wherever I look is prior absence, no figure, ruin, escaping an aesthetic. Hammock Electric Fan Ghost don't qualify as guards the comfortable interior. My guest inhabits is a moving base states of dwelling that are undetermined walls, cross hatched like mother tongues. A foreign woman occupies a home that's impersonal like the nest of a parasite. Its value is contentless but photograph in the context of an indigenous population tipping between physical ease and the freedom of animals accumulating risk. When the scene is complex, I turn to the audience and comment out loud, then return to the room and language at hand weakened by whoever didn't hear me. As if I don't recognize the role because my family moved in while I was away as text implicated with outside the wall is waves. So I decorate in new mother tongue. (()).	Subject
