Silliman-Ron_Complete-Discussion_Fellows_KWH-UPenn_3-20-12	0.253	340.57	Find in the council of= of dreams an old tomb. The band itself half forgotten beneath the shards of melody to locate a tone as an index to emotions not recognized at the time but held closely, more so than that to which we thought we'd paid attention. A quality of light underneath the streetlamp is how it dampens color. How color itself is a thing imposed as the sun imposes day. Day when it arrives, if it arrives, is layered and must be stripped, though never in the same way twice. If ever we are to discover the ((pulse)) at the core. What fiction? What nonsense? Voices over in the corner jabbering with no thought of who listens. The line already is inherent and the upright letter oriented. Speech is not a given. The tongue is infected. It is very cold. Worlds hurdle through the night sky, where it is apparent that day is the exception, that it may even be a fiction, a creation not of light, but of desire. I want speech. Sky, air, wind, sun, surround. For want of storm windows we hung quilts. Birds shake snow from the lighter branches. The traction faction. One doesn't so much sleep under all these blankets as one does cook. Pencil is a blunt instrument. In a coma, I am told, all evidence of palsy disappears. You yawn freely, widely, the way an infant yawns asleep. I shall not hear birds in these trees again. Words hurdle through the night sky. Three. Stripped of furnishings, the familiar house became exactly what it was. An object, alien, a machine, each room a potential or function. There in the leafless forest we could see the huge nest high atop a poplar. From here I can walk to the train. So much assumed in the instant. Twenty five bones per hand or foot. Three muscles roughly for every bone. Behind that wall, the low hum of the surface. After several days of warmer temperatures the snow still has not melted. The last mounds dark and translucent. Cakes of ice. Odd how after thirty years a phrase such as, the beauty wapiti, still rings in the mind. Oncoming cars, headlights shimmer dimly in the fog. At the road's edge back in the streets the deer watch us, witness without interpretation. The flower's knowledge of its own process is not counted as mind. I walk with each hand balled into a fist four oh yeah, you're one of the ones who can write in the dark. Thank you, Ron. So we have some time for questions. Molly's got the microphone. Who's going to be brave and ask the first question? And here we go. Right in the back there, Molly. Good morning. So I= uh I wanted to talk about the blog a little bit more before it gets too far away from that. um And I was really curious # I mean, you talked a lot abo- # you talked a little bit about how it's a way to educate people without the filter of the university Grotesque. G- grotesque filter of the university. You like that word. {laugh} {laugh} You said it. {laugh} um And I= I remember a couple of years ago when you disabled comments on your blog Yes. and the reasoning you gave was trolling and flaming and I know the Buffalo poetics listserv kind of had the same thing a few years ago and um I mean it's # the= the first thing I thought of was a sort of generational thing because I think for the young people in here, like we see YouTube comments or these kinds of things that you= know= you= know= you know what to ignore and you know what to listen to. um So I was curious if you think there is any sort of like general uh # generational divide in you know, language we accept, if there's a valuation of language in the discussion um that kind of goes on on the internet. um ((If)) (()) Well (()) actually it's more gender than= a= than a generational one, at least with regards to the blog but I # I'll try and deal with both of these. um I # as my job during the l- # the last twelve years ramped up in the amount of time it absorbed my ability to police the comments section on a daily basis uh was beginning to extend further and further. um There were a number of people # are a number of people, not just on my blog but elsewhere on the net, um who do seem to be completely unaware of the implications of some of their language when they use terms of color and gender when, you know, it's the (()) # you know, there's the joke of the old Saturday Night Live routine Jane, you ignorant slut. When somebody hears them self called that on the weblog by somebody whose name they know it's actually less pleasant. um and uh not catching every one of those every day  meant that I was having a reaction that was I think dividing my readership by gender so that I was get- # my blog was becoming more and more of a male space and with all the negative aspects of the male space	Speaker1
