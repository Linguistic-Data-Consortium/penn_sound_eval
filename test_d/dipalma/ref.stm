DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A Speaker1 0.55 342.938 The beats were almost always serious too I remember That got me into the literary quarterlies and through the x writer's workshop and helped me understand my own dark corners and sharp angles and then one day I realized how much of what I was reading and often admiring going on around me in the poetry world was a kind of picking of scabs and flashing the open sores and wounds as badges and credentials and how O'Hara totally sidestepped that contemporary tendency by tone and choice of vocabulary that cut through the hopelessness of so much poetry and replaced it with the joy of writing a poem What a simple but wonderful revelation the joy of writing it down That was what x  that was what it suddenly seemed to be about in a way that made me think of all I had heard the painters of his time were trying to do get across the action of the creating rather than the product that was so finished it showed no signs of the activity the energy and spirit of the actual work that went into it O'Hara's poems were little excursions into the act of writing poems with the kind of mindset that keeps us trying sex with strangers again and again The hope that this time is going to be great give us much pleasure and satisfy a lot of frustration and totally annul the boring horrible deadening killing in fact effects of living the modern urban existence I think I rewrote that phrase But I still couldn't reconcile that achievement with the personal references though they were becoming more and more familiar and thus less and less elitist though still somewhat obscure And one day I was teaching contemporary poetry to a college class and talking about a poem of O'Hara's I think it was a step away from them After talking about the poem Steps and how it overcame the sadness of love's ending or going sour amid the big city grind and in discussing how it did this mostly through the structure of the poem because by then I'd learned so much about movement and rhythm and construction I could see how well made O'Hara's poems are despite or maybe because of their conversational flow and in the process of explaining why the poems were good from a strategic and structural point of view because they accomplished this message of hope in the face of contemporary despair and despite wellfounded reasons for lamenting our condition or his condition in the specific circumstances of the poem and did it through technical agility so refined the surface ambience of ease and a kind of glib grace was hardly disturbed suddenly I caught myself starting to cry and I never cried back then in fact except for a short interlude of about a year of weepiness I never cried period except over old movies or musicals and it was that heartstring O'Hara had suddenly plucked in me through his poetry that sang so naturally and yet skillfully of overcoming stupidity and tediousness of so much of life The true romantic only without the pretentious and really elitist selfconscious and selfsatisfied seriousness of the walking wounds of contemporary poetry because by mocking the tone of the real and original romantics partly through the use of quotation marks and italics which is a sort of what campy dialogue often depends on as others have pointed out it means talking in italics and exclamation points and exclamations Oh he was making himself vulnerable to a x scalpel unlike the confessional poets and others of his contemporaries Even the seemingly honest beats who always exposed themselves in ways that demanded applause or appreciation for the courage of the exposure or the extent of selfdestruction the exposure caused or exposed et cetera But not O'Hara his defenses were the shrewdest and toughest of all because they weren't defensive at all but appeared to be all offensive only the offensive was mounted against his own and others' defensiveness thus he could be attacked for elitism when he's in fact he's our most democratic poet since Whitman bringing that tradition full circle by reversing Whitman's posing as the common man brother to all which reduced everyone to the level of anonymity that Whitman's poems ensured would never really be his fate so he could afford it I'm talking about the pose which perhaps became a reality much the way Ginsberg seems to have which is not the poetry because Whitman's poetry is often wonderful and amazing and very much more the source of much that is associated with O'Hara and the New York school than many of the French writers constantly attributed with having influenced the New York scene Although O'Hara is also sort of a Baude  Baudelairean reverse making the most of the worst of Baudelaire's pessimistic predictions about urban existence by preserving the best of perceptions and emotionalisms the city scene can generate but instead O'Hara elevates everyone to the level and attentive familiarity of stars throwing in the names of personal friends alongside those of personal heroes and famous and worldrenowned producers and creators of the culture that has come to be ours and which he defined before most of us and with the clarity of the lyrics of a Hollywood musical or a Madison Avenue add Yet with all the subtlety and imaginative exuberance of a great wit and passionate lover What an incredibly seductive combination for a poet His poems are sexy The language is often intimate the images voluptuous and often exotic the energy seemingly endless to the point usually reassuring and flattering with just enough elusive connections to make us want to put out the time and energy to make ourselves as attractively intelligent and perceptive and experienced and in the know as the poems assume we are He refused to accept an audience that was not as good as he was and in that way included us all in the community of friends he admired and addressed and referred to along with the proper names and familiar rhythms of the most ordinary people and things all of which he incorporated into descriptions and narratives that included the proper names and rhythms of the most extraordinary things the rest of us are only now x after the poems were written written getting hip to and how well they fit and work and complete the artistry of O'Hara's genius He helped me realize that the reason I wrote poems was often simply because the rush the feeling that accompanied the writing of the poem especially when it seemed to be coming out good couldn't be duplicated anywhere else It wasn't a substitute for anything else going to bed with someone beautiful and tough or eating a delicious and totally satisfying meal or outwitting a horribly abusive competitive creep in a conversation and it wasn't a grueling act of anguish and pain getting in touch with all the crabbed secrets of the psyche and exposing to them to the wellorganized and systematic scrutiny of some poetic form or strategy no
