Tchaikovsky is in a playful mood Over here he declares pointing to the croissant sitting atop what appears to be a raisin Is the extraordinary Pere Lachaise Cemetery with the magnificent Marc Antoine Charpentier far beneath its crust You will have to imagine the sounds of the Baroque concertino yourself If you want to know I think in my best moments I am worthy to nourish the same patch of ground or vice versa he adds with a wink biting off an end of the croissant and leaving Carpentier exposed to the close air of the parlor Any particular Baroque composer I enquire whose concertina I'm supposed to be imagining I didn't say the composer had to be Baroque Peter counters airily Only the work What about Porcini I had to confess I was stumped The only composer I knew by that name was a local and rather inept butcher who somewhat resembled the results of his trade My host who by this time had finished off both the Pere Lachaise Cemetery and the remains of poor Charpentier was looking particularly sly What instruments are used in this concertino by Porcini that you have in mind I ask carefully But I could see that I had waited too long that Tchaikovsky had entered the tunnel of self absorption and was already far out of earshot I will enter the salon of the immortal soul he continued to himself flinging open the closet with an elegantly melancholy flourish Staring at the not overly expansive view he mumbled aloud I would never have tried to support myself by playing the piano by simultaneously reading a book in a Hamburg bordello like my cunningly controversial colleague once did It was Brahms if you want to know And I know what women are like too They're different and I don't understand them He pointed indecisively at the further wall See that promontory over there A beautiful siren used to sit and comb her tasteless mass of tresses Once I approached and the smell was absolutely horrible But alas I will never see her splendid face again   And these are earlier obviously Not in geological time particularly but historical time And The Allegorical Figure of Brooklyn And the allegorical figure of Brooklyn is right here there where you're standing and here's how it works The lamps go on and we walk through miles of parts The rain and the sleet are brought on We travel to Queens for two weeks of vacation The sun returns and the grass and farms the villages of Brooklyn continue to grow And the spacious terrace and oily sand of Brooklyn breathe rocked slowly by the figure and back toward home on the BMT we smile at the tender figure and wave goodbye North The direction not the poet I didn't know him at the time The green figures move forward and the objects grow larger explorers of the sky exploring the earth immersed in water Nineteen sixteen seven with its fatal look of artificial brevity your life as if an illusion putting you near the window and promptly all the winds and currents ruffle the curtains But the humid surroundings a transparent lizard under the leaves and stretching its rubber like plastic across the room protruding with our European selves show that we valiantly dig at the earth poised on the brink of adventure or blister the flatulent sky In other words you are held amused peacefully in the grass oh beautiful art springing to mind as we are the supreme judges Or perhaps you have forgotten an important exaggerated phrase and your words spread over the stones in a pure grove of the specific and you speak only the names of the bellowing animals plants and trees which blind you touch Ships insects peopling the forest et cetera The labyrinth speaks from its precipice its outline shoots in a curve through the chemical air in addition to writing the script Oh miracles of divine reaches and words spinning from infancy and whose business and indispensable references are not known Your story is truly a story to treasure distilled intoxicant that it is saying that I'm a synonym for the relaxed and drifting universe a mere summary holding my attention over the thundering firmament    April Twenty Fourth Each year our group holds a ceremony at the grave of some great poet singing and paying tribute to his memory for some great poems he has left to be read and remembered Last Spring Edwin Denby Kenneth Koch John Ashbery Jimmy Schuyler Kenward Elmslie Frank Lima Bill Berkson Joe Ceravolo Ted Berrigan Allan Kaplan Ron Padgett Dick Gallup Larry Fagin Peter Schjeldahl Joe Brainard John Girono Anne Waldman Michael Brownstein Lewis Warsh David Shapiro and I chartered a bus and went to visit the Hart Crane monument in Cleveland We returned on April twenty fourth refreshed amused and ready to write The budding plants and flowers after their endless absence during the harsh winter gave us all the feeling of being in love for the first time That is after the harsh winter of white snow and cold wandering visions as the windows rattled in the wind when the floors creaked in the midst of our pondering memories and complaints and from and from when the pitch of a snowy night the furious wolf dripping blood from the gaping jar of his mouth pacing the shelves in flames reminded us of the terrible days of Hart Crane when people were not as kind to poets as they are today  Notes on Velazquez For Irving and Lucy Sandler  My career has been spent as a courtier and as a familiar of the court and the king I am Velazquez It is difficult to explain myself Caravaggio is a buffoon my six year old son could do better Ah yes Velazquez When I'm admiring his work I feel this twinge of impatience There are so many improvements to make I do not know where to begin I am Manet Everything is hopeless in this miserable century When Manet comes floating up to our great studio in the sky I will give him a sound thrashing Signed Rubens eighteen sixty two Velazquez and Rubens were buddies okay   The Sea and The Wind  There is no light and no quiet Some areas are smaller than others A shout does not hurt it once but makes a way in leisure to your ear and in a moment of leisure you hear it with the sound of your voice
