THIS SOUNDS CRAZY BUT SO DOES MINE IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR TWO CITIES TO BE FARTHER APART THAN TAIPEI AND NEW YORK THEY ARE AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE EARTH SEPARATED BY A DISTANCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND MILES AND WHEN IT IS DAY IN ONE IT IS NIGHT IN THE OTHER AS THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN TAIPEI MARVELED OVER THE ASTOUNDING CONNECTION THEY HAD JUST UNCOVERED THEY realiseD THAT THEIR TWO SISTERS WERE PROBABLY ASLEEP AT THAT MOMENT ON THE SAME FLOOR OF THE SAME BUILDING IN NORTHERN MANHATTAN EACH ONE WAS SLEEPING IN HER OWN APARTMENT UNAWARE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ABOUT THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD ALTHOUGH THEY WERE neighbourS IT TURNED OUT THAT THE TWO SISTERS IN NEW YORK DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WHEN THEY FINALLY MET TWO YEARS LATER NEITHER ONE OF THEM WAS LIVING IN THAT BUILDING any more SIRI AND I WERE MARRIED THEN ONE EVENING ON OUR WAY TO AN APPOINTMENT SOMEWHERE WE HAPPENED TO STOP IN AT A BOOKSTORE ON BROADWAY TO BROWSE FOR A FEW MINUTES WE MUST HAVE WANDERED INTO DIFFERENT AISLES AND BECAUSE I AND BECAUSE SIRI WANTED TO SHOW ME SOMETHING OR BECAUSE I WANTED TO SHOW HER SOMETHING I {can not / cannot} REMEMBER ONE OF {us / u. s.} SPOKE THE {other's / other is / other has} NAME OUT LOUD A SECOND LATER A WOMAN CAME RUSHING UP TO {us / u. s.} {you are / you were} PAUL AUSTER AND SIRI HUSTVEDT are not YOU SHE SAID YES WE SAID {that's / that is / that has} EXACTLY WHO WE ARE HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT THE WOMAN THEN EXPLAINED THAT HER SISTER AND SIRI'S SISTER HAD BEEN STUDENTS TOGETHER IN TAIWAN THE CIRCLE HAD BEEN CLOSED AT LAST SINCE THAT EVENING IN THE BOOKSTORE TEN YEARS AGO THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR BEST AND MOST LOYAL FRIENDS EIGHT THREE SUMMERS AGO A LETTER TURNED UP IN MY MAILBOX IT CAME IN A WHITE OBLONG ENVELOPE AND WAS ADDRESSED TO SOMEONE WHOSE NAME WAS UNFAMILIAR TO ME ROBERT M MORGAN OF SEATTLE WASHINGTON VARIOUS POST OFFICE MARKINGS WERE STAMPED ACROSS THE FRONT NOT DELIVERABLE UNABLE TO FORWARD RETURN TO WRITER MISTER MORGAN'S NAME HAD BEEN CROSSED OUT WITH A PEN AND BESIDE IT SOMEONE HAD WRITTEN NOT AT THIS ADDRESS DRAWN IN THE SAME BLUE INK AN ARROW POINTED TO THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE ENVELOPE ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS RETURN TO SENDER ASSUMING THAT THE POST OFFICE HAD MADE A MISTAKE I CHECKED THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER TO SEE WHO THE SENDER WAS THERE TO MY ABSOLUTE BEWILDERMENT I DISCOVERED MY OWN NAME AND MY OWN ADDRESS NOT ONLY THAT BUT THIS INFORMATION WAS PRINTED ON A CUSTOM MADE ADDRESS LABEL ONE OF THOSE LABELS YOU CAN ORDER IN PACKS OF TWO HUNDRED FROM ADVERTISEMENTS ON MATCHBOOK COVERS THE SPELLING OF MY NAME WAS CORRECT THE ADDRESS WAS MY ADDRESS AND YET THE FACT WAS AND STILL IS THAT I HAVE NEVER OWNED OR ORDERED A SET OF PRINTED ADDRESS LABELS IN MY LIFE INSIDE THERE WAS A SINGLE SPACE TYPE WRITTEN LETTER THAT BEGAN DEAR ROBERT IN RESPONSE TO YOUR LETTER DATED JULY FIFTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE I CAN ONLY SAY THAT LIKE OTHER AUTHORS I OFTEN RECEIVE LETTERS CONCERNING MY WORK THEN IN A BOMBASTIC PRETENTIOUS STYLE RIDDLED WITH QUOTATIONS FROM FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS AND OOZING WITH A TONE OF CONCEIT AND SELF SATISFACTION THE LETTER WRITER WENT ON TO PRAISE ROBERT FOR THE IDEAS HE HAD DEVELOPED ABOUT ONE OF MY BOOKS AT A COLLEGE COURSE ON THE CONTEMPORARY NOVEL IT WAS A CONTEMPTIBLE LETTER THE KIND OF LETTER I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF WRITING TO ANYONE AND YET IT WAS SIGNED WITH MY NAME THE HANDWRITING DID NOT RESEMBLE MINE BUT THAT WAS SMALL COMFORT SOMEONE WAS OUT THERE TRYING TO IMPERSONATE ME AND AS FAR AS I KNOW HE STILL IS ONE FRIEND SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF MAIL ART KNOWING THAT THE LETTER COULD NOT BE DELIVERED TO ROBERT MORGAN SINCE THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON THE AUTHOR OF THE LETTER WAS ACTUALLY ADDRESSING HIS REMARKS TO ME BUT THAT WOULD IMPLY AN UNWARRANTED FAITH IN THE {us / u. s.} POSTAL SERVICE AND I DOUBT THAT SOMEONE WHO WOULD GO TO THE TROUBLE OF ORDERING ADDRESS LABELS IN MY NAME AND THEN SITTING DOWN TO WRITE SUCH AN ARROGANT HIGH FLOWN LETTER WOULD LEAVE ANYTHING TO CHANCE OR WOULD HE PERHAPS THE SMART ALECKS OF THIS WORLD BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING WILL ALWAYS GO THEIR WAY I HAVE SCANT HOPE OF EVER GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS LITTLE MYSTERY THE PRANKSTER DID A GOOD JOB OF COVERING HIS TRACKS AND HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE WHAT PUZZLES ME ABOUT MY OWN BEHAVIOR IS THAT I HAVE NOT THROWN AWAY THE LETTER EVEN THOUGH IT CONTINUES TO GIVE ME CHILLS EVERY TIME I LOOK AT IT
