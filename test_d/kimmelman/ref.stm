Kimmelman-Burt_Complete-reading_KWH-UPenn_10-26-2010 A Subject 0.18 400.891 Time most of all The first funeral tells us this in long hair and soft bodies folding one over another Imagined rain in an unstilled grief Everywhere in the house garden beyond it there is measured time and space and a calm in the cool stone Cool lovers I too move my naked and immense hands and feet through the old high wooden rooms and then out into trees filtering summer sun onto other forms other statues outdoors and rest my long arm as in the kiss on a slab of the unworked stone There is a raw desire in the cool but sunny day Thus I find my way back into stone its certainty The garden behind the house its light and shadows on statues bring memory out with them into the brighter open air In the museum itself a woman sits sketching a woman lying along her stone bed On a bench in the bright sunlight a woman lies beside the figure of another reclining like a cat Stretches and sleeps again in the sun They both look equally alive One asleep in flesh the other eyes closed awake in stone I'm going to read a few new things which you may n  may or not notice but they're they're sort of different to it because they're oh I'll say eighty six where are we now This is two thousand ten so that's uh s  sixteen years right Twenty four years Huh Twenty four Thanks Yeah yeah It was a  there was a uh  anybody any anybody listen to Car Talk Yeah so uh they w  they told this joke about somebody online and it  you know it's it's at the uh supermarket and it's like ten items or less And the person has all these items you know that he's unloading onto the conveyor belt and uh the cashier says to him You know either you're from MIT which means you can't read or you're from Harvard which means you can't count So   So you're from Harvard uh Yeah well not from Harvard but anyway yeah Alright let me start with uh my newest piece and and kind of work backwards It's it's a great way to see if a poem works is to read it aloud to to people So uh now I have to again give you some backstory here uh There was  there's a film that came out uh in New York i It it was  appeared uh at a couple of theaters and it had a short run um a few months ago uh called An Unfinished Film  And uh the occasion of the film was that some footage from the Warsaw Ghetto was unearthed no one knew about And uh and I f  I'm forgetting the name of this director utterly brilliant director She took this footage and put together this amazing film with voiceover and so on uh And so this is a poem about watching that film Now let me just tell you if you don't know about the film it's not like um  it's not like the the um film footage of uh Theresienstadt and uh maybe some people don't know what Theresienstadt was but during World War Two the Germans created a er a f a fake or a mock u uh not  well no  a a fake uh concentration camp and they they filmed everybody there and the people looked well fed and they were doing interesting things and they were happy These these were the Jews who had been brought from o  elsewhere in Europe and placed there and it was you know it was kind of like a propaganda thing you know um Well An Unfinished Film the person who devised this this film um had a ver  had something very different in mind because rather than just have it  well I mean I think initially they wanted it  the Germans wanted it to be for publicity but they kind of went a little too far or they really got too involved because it's clear from the from the found footage  and by the way there's like a second camera and there may have even in  at certain points been a third camera so like the second camera will show the first cameraman filming the inhabitants of the ghetto who are being made to act in certain sc in certain scenes that have been uh orchestrated  uh and uh and in fact one of the cameramen was found and was interviewed for the film  And there are people who survived the Warsaw Ghetto who are also  they they're filmed watching the footage and then making comments about it and uh  we well so so so the scenes are  and this is like early in the Warsaw Ghetto so there are people who have uh been brought there from all over you know And some of these people have more money than than others and you know So I mean you see p  you see bodies lying in the street It's not that the Germans are not trying to show that but what they decided to do was to show that and then show the way people reacted to that kind of thing So they'll have people  they'll they'll do twenty takes of people who are sort of well dressed and also poor people walking around a body that's lying on the sidewalk Or a bakery and there's a couple of things in the window and they'll show the the really raggedy people looking at  looking through the window and then they they parade the well shod Jews in you know as if they're going to buy something and they do tha  you know you see one take after another so w  I think what happen  you know the surmisal is that somebody eventually realized that uh this film was was a little too revealing and it does say something about  uh what you know a s  a  uh perhaps a need to shame people rather than just uh you know kill them you know So anyway this is this is my uh poem about that film and uh it  I don't know if anybody knows the poetry of Hugh Seidman but he writes these very terse
