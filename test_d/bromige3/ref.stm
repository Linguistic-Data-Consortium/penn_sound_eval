Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel A Subject 0.122 547.339 When the bunk shook so hard stuff fell from the ceiling he saw whose hand it was But the woman had pulled him so strongly into her front that a button of her dress had dug in his cheek above the bone and that pain took over But after that but after that he saw the hand often looking where it was cut through just like the meat in the butcher's There was something he wanted to do with it He picked it up and felt it from outside and then from in as though he wore it on his wrist like his own hands He still searched for the jagged metals but now his father had told him where it came from He treasured particularly those pieces molded like a screw You save them up hoping he'd one day have all the pieces and be able to put them together like a jigsaw puzzle and build a shell of his own Would it be mine He asked the father or the governments His father told him his if he kept it hidden So there was that to think about He could go out looking in the gutters when the sounds came late at night I want to start with a book with poems My first book which came out in nineteen sixty five called The Gathering That's the name of the book The poem is called we could get a drink Sunday morning lying in complacencies of the newly wed Out the window the slender sun silver trees lead me back to Hampstead Heath where I run again Down sparse grass banks by clumps of gorse Below silver trees I try to tell you but end up we could get a drink on a Sunday anyway You laugh move closer under the covers Our silver limbs stir in the gloom like cutthroat trout I saw in a lake a hundred miles out of Vancouver hiding their strike in shadow The mind a fish shifting fragilely its position when the body's easy a still pool Now eddies in a scene from a documentary seen months back Girl eyes like yours girl slung over a Tommy's shoulder Mouth open but nothing said until the commentator as the camera pans past the black patch I don't watch because my eye hooks on the hatrack hips Says starved to death the soldier throws her into a pit That's a tangle of white Very slender limbs Went sliding down the crater's muddy slide The instant I called there's a bomb fell here last night Let's look at the crater Went running over the Heath laughing my friends alone running Down to today when looking at silver birch I say nothing at all but we could get a drink there Move closer beneath the blanket while the cutthroat flick under their bank This next poem is issued as a book called Please Like Me It was put out by Black Sparrow Press in Los Angeles this year Strolling through the town all the houses quiet at this hour the street already hot hold women The leader of our magazine crew knew how to gain entrance by knowing that door opening before the act the door opening The woman with him his packet already hung on the back of a chair his shirt coming off crossed to the window to pull the shade making it night But in the morning unknowing despite the look she gave him and me watching mentioned her husband who handled such matters her hands at the necklace her throat was naked of Compliant women my expression insisted equally turn me away and they would A snapshot one of them took as I lugged up my arm to knock faded falls from my wallet as I count my take from last night another subscription sold working late to think Great weight brought to bear on a door flies open at your first touch Your momentum pitches you sickeningly into the vacuum cleaner parked in the narrow hall the muscles involved with nothing to parry ache a nagging sense of something far from being right A wrench in the very socket of the self A disarming tenderness as if on the instant I stopped now knocked here went in found rose lamps lit indistinctly for the sun that floods the room The brakes the skid begun surface slick with the summer shower he jammed The chevy's tires nothing to grip on slid the four of us within inches of the poem's abruption Welcome And again welcome Make yourself to home Drove nails into the plaster that wouldn't support even a picture hardly a heavy piece Chiaroscuro print cut with a knife from a library book because I against all claims of social conscience against all readers whose thighs tomorrow would push against the metal crosspiece of the turnstile wanted it The blood floods the shaft Half moon focus in an enormity of sky extends by fractions limits The blood continuously feeds skin sinew ligaments wherein a heaviness of pleasure Posit night and it is night a white flashlight conjures a white door A red calls forth a red With which your can't come in she shouts But that's no use I want All right you son of a bitch you bluffer Even though the sentiment itself be but a bluff I'll call you But useless again if the man on the path must tell her what to say She switches on her porch light and the day goes that kind of light by which the face that passed translucent skin nose freckled at what bridge it had the eyes prominent enough so light could be seen to pass through the pupil nonetheless left dark but liquid dark the bones of the cheek and chin so clean
