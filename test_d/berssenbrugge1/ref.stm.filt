AND ENTERS YOUR MEMORY THAT {there's / there is / there has} NO PRESENT OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HER IS YOUR EXPECTATION every one BECOMES GREAT IN PROPORTION TO A SINGER'S SPURIOUS EXPECTATIONS LIKE SO MANY GOOD MISTAKES PARACHUTE ON THE DESERT BLUE WITH LIGHT ELEVEN SHEEP HEAD TO HEAD IN A CIRCLE ASLEEP ENJOYMENT AND SUBSTANCE IN REAL TIME INVOLVE CLEARINGS ABOUT WHICH PIVOT OPAQUE ZONES REAL IS A SPAN OF VISIBILITY IN AS MUCH AS YOUR FLESH IS NOT CHAOTIC OF A CONTINGENCY THE REAL THING SUBSTITUTES FOR ANOTHER {who's / who is / who has} NOT REPRESENTABLE AS HE GATHERS UP PARACHUTE AND DELIVERY IF I STAY HERE AND YOU MEAN SOMETHING THE PART IN COMMON IS DISJUNCT FROM WHAT YOU MEAN LIKE MY HANDS TOUCHING THAT {you are / you were} TELEPATHIC MEANS NOTHING YOU FACTS YOU {can not / cannot} KNOW WHICH STILL WORK IN THE CONNECTIONS OF MY EXPERIENCE A ROCK IN RAIN DISTRIBUTING WATER ALONG TEXTURE IS MY RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE INASMUCH AS YOUR FLESH IS AN INVISIBLE INTERPLAY OF DISJUNCTION NEEDED FOR IDENTITY FLESH IS TEXTURE OUR MEETING OCCURS NEAR A HILL YOU CLIMB EVERY DAY TO WATER TRANSPLANTED IRIS WHY do not YOU LET OTHERS DO THAT ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WISH TO SEPARATE FROM HIM NOW DUE TO FAULTS OF COMPOUND PHENOMENA BEING DEMONSTRATED IT SEEMS HE WILL DISAPPEAR FROM MY SIGHT AND HEARING THE BEAUTY OF HIS SONG DERIVES FROM THE FACT IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING TO SOMEONE ANY FAMILY {that's / that is / that has} CONCENTRATED IN SO FAR AS IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING MAY BE TAKEN FOR SOMEONE WHEREVER {there's / there is / there has} WAITING IS THIS TRANSFERENCE THE DANGER IS you will BE DECEIVED BY THE METONYMY OF MY TENDER FEELING SO LIGHT AND MULTIPLE YOU GO TO PICK UP THE CHILD AFTER SCHOOL YOU REMAIN A FEW MOMENTS TALKING WITH A TEACHER BESIDE THE LOOM WHY ARE YOU TELLING HER THIS GLORY FORMLESS SUBSTANCE CIRCULAR DAWN LIKE A {child's / child is / child has} DRAWING OF STARS OR SNOWFLAKES AND LINES EACH LINE CONNECTS SO {it's / it is / it has} THE SAME STAR FALLING LOOP TO LOOP AND EACH LINE BELONGS TO EACH STAR MY FRIEND THE WHITE RABBIT LITTLE MOUSE SQUIRREL IMPATIENT SHAKING OFF THEIR CLOTHES I WANTED TO WRITE A A POEM FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE FERTILE AREA OF THE MARGIN BUT THEN WHEN I WROTE IT IT WAS CALLED NEST AND {it's / it is / it has} IN IN FIVE PARTS MY MOTHER TONGUE CHINESE HAS AN IMMEMORIAL HISTORY BEFORE ME I WAS INSERTED INTO IT A MOTIVE FOR MY LANGUAGE I LEARNED IT NATURALLY FILLING IT WITH INTENTIONS AND WILL LEAVE IT with out INTENT FOR OTHER CHILDREN MY MOTHER AND I SPEAK A LOCAL LANGUAGE AND some timeS OUR MOTHER TONGUE AS IN MY DREAM WITH ITS INTENT WHAT DO YOU INTEND IN CHANGING THE MOTHER TONGUE OF MY DAUGHTER COMPASSION NOT BEING ILL SLEEP IN WHICH SHE RESONATES DEPTH LIKE A BELL LOVING THE WIND IS EQUIVALENT TO INTENTION AS RHETORICAL SURFACE LIKE WRITING A DIARY ON HER SKIN NON COMPREHENSION TIPS AMBIVALENT MATTER AS IF THERE WERE TWO OF {us / u. s.} HERE ONE IS ONE IS MOTHER TONGUE HER MATTER INSERTED A MOTIVE IS ALWAYS SOMEWHERE ELSE EXITING ONE LANGUAGE ANOTHER with out INTENT TRANSLATED AS HEART I WANT TO TELL YOU {what's / what is / what has / what does} DIFFICULT TO ADMIT THAT I LEFT HOME CHANGE OF MOTHER TONGUE BETWEEN {us / u. s.} ACTIVATES AN IMMUNE SYSTEM MARGIN WHERE DWELLING AND TRAVEL ARE NOT DISTINCT THE ARTIFACTS THROW THEMSELVES TOWARD LIGHT with out BECOMING SIGNIFICATION TELLING YOU IS NOT AN EDGE OF THE LIGHT {there's / there is / there has} NO MARGIN OF A SHADOW TO IMPLY INTERIOR IN MY CHILDHOOD HOUSE WAS A DEEP PORCH COVERED WITH VINES LOOK PAST OUR SILHOUETTE TO SILHOUETTES LIKE SHADOWS OF GUESTS ARRIVING IN THE BRIGHT YARD LIGHT IN THE NEXT ROOM FALLS ON HER AS SHE BENDS TO KISS YOU SKYLIGHT POURS DOWN THEN COVERS THE MUD WALL LIKE CLOTH I OBSERVE THE LIGHTED FEEL THAT SEEMS TO HANG IN SPACE IN FRONT OF ME SPEAKING NOT FILLING IN A SURFACE INTENT IS LIKE A CABINET OF ARTIFACTS COMPARISON COEXISTING WITH INCONGRUITY MY ORIGIN IS A LINGUISTIC SURFACE LIKE A DECORATED WALL NO LITTLE HOUSES AT DUSK YELLOW LIGHTS COMING ON PHYSICAL MUTE ITS SIGNIFICANCE IS RECEIVED OUTSIDE HEARING DECORATING SIMPLY BY OPENING THE VIEW WHEREVER I LOOK IS PRIOR ABSENCE NO FIGURE RUIN ESCAPING AN AESTHETIC HAMMOCK ELECTRIC FAN GHOST do not QUALIFY AS GUARDS THE COMFORTABLE INTERIOR MY GUEST INHABITS IS A MOVING BASE STATES OF DWELLING THAT ARE UNDETERMINED WALLS CROSS HATCHED LIKE MOTHER TONGUES A FOREIGN WOMAN OCCUPIES A HOME {that's / that is / that has} IMPERSONAL LIKE THE NEST OF A PARASITE ITS VALUE IS CONTENTLESS BUT PHOTOGRAPH IN THE CONTEXT OF AN INDIGENOUS POPULATION TIPPING BETWEEN PHYSICAL EASE AND THE FREEDOM OF ANIMALS ACCUMULATING RISK WHEN THE SCENE IS COMPLEX I TURN TO THE AUDIENCE AND COMMENT OUT LOUD THEN RETURN TO THE ROOM AND LANGUAGE AT HAND WEAKENED BY who ever did not HEAR ME AS IF I do not recognise THE ROLE BECAUSE MY FAMILY MOVED IN WHILE I WAS AWAY AS TEXT IMPLICATED WITH OUTSIDE THE WALL IS WAVES SO I DECORATE IN NEW MOTHER TONGUE X
