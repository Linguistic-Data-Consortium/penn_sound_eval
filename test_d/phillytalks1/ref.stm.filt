PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A Subject 0.644 406.333 YOU EXPECT TO BE INSTRUCTED BY INSTRUCTIONS AND YOU do not GET VERY INSTRUCTED BY THEM YOU KNOW AND {they are / they were} VERY FRENCH IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} JUST SORT OF KIND OF LIKE FRENCH THEORY {you are / you were} LIKE READING ALONG AND YOU GO WHAT YOU KNOW CAN YOU RUN THAT BY ME AGAIN AND I LIKED THE WAY THE WIT THIS QUOTE WAS SIMILAR TO A LOT OF THE PIECES IN THERE IN THE SENSE THAT SYMMETRY IN IN MATH I A A SYMMETRICAL EQUATION I {it's / it is / it has} THE SAME IN BOTH DIRECTIONS YOU GO THOUGH ALL OF THESE PROCEDURES AND {it's / it is / it has} THE SAME SO NOTHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND BUT ALL THIS STUFF HAPPENS AND SO YOU START OUT WITH THE SAME THING AT EITHER END AND A AND I I WAS INTERESTED IN THAT IDEA SO {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF I {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF STASIS AND THEN SYMMETRY IS A KIND OF STASIS AND BUT {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF QUIVERY STASIS THAT is not REALLY STASIS BECAUSE IT JUST THEN IT SORT OF COLLAPSES AND THEN YOU HAVE A KIND OF ANTI STASIS SO THIS THIS QUOTE SEEMED TO DO THAT FOR ME IN A WAY THAT IT WAS INTERESTING AND THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK THAT YOU TAKE FROM IT IS A SENSE OF SYMMETRICALITY AND THAT PERSISTENCE IN THE SITUATION AND THAT RELATES TO MY READING OF DAVID WHICH IS TO SAY YOU JUST HAVE TO STARE INTO IT AND PERSIST %bcack SO I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN EVOKING THAT IT does not SEEM VERY EXPLANATORY AS A QUOTE IT SEEMS ANTI EXPLANATORY AND YET IT SEEMS KIND OF TO HAVE AN NUANCE TO I YOU KNOW NUMINOUS QUALITY TO IT I LIKED YEAH THAT WAS VERY CLEAR IN IN SO MANY POINTS TO JUST SAID THAT PARAGRAPH YEAH i am TAKING NOTES NOW {that's / that is / that has} {that's / that is / that has} WONDERFUL SO SO SO THINGS CHANGE ONLY THROUGH SOME COLLAPSE OF THE STASIS OF SYMMETRY WELL YE I IF ASYMMETRY AS YOU POINT OUT SYMMETRY AND NOT SYMMETRY ARE THE SAME SO AN ASYMMETRY ASS ASSUMES LACK OF SYMMETRY AND SO YOU KNOW THEY MAKE UP SYMMETRY YEAH X SO HOW DO YOU EVER GET TO CHANGE I MEAN HOW DOES ONE GET HOW DOES ONE HOW DOES ONE THINK THAT THROUGH SO THA HOW CAN ONE ARTICULATE THAT STATEMENT SO THAT CHANGE IS SO THAT THE FACT OF CHANGE IS ENCOMPASSED THINK OF DEATH YEAH {it's / it is / it has} CHANGED I MEAN {there's / there is / there has} {there's / there is / there has} SOMEBODY IN IN I WAS JUST IN BUFFALO AND SOMEBODY SAID ASKED ME A QUESTION AND IT WAS %bcack YEAH {what's / what is / what has / what does} YOUR POSITION ON CHANGE DO YOU THINK CHANGE IS GOOD OR ARE YOU AGAINST CHANGE X AND AND I I SAID IT JUST IT YOU WE do not HAVE A CHOICE AND IT JUST SNEAKS RIGHT UP ON YOU WHEN YOU JUST LEAST EXPECT IT AND CHANGES AND AND YO WHEN WHEN THINGS ARE BAD YOU W YOU THINK THAT CHANGE IS GOOD BECAUSE THINGS ARE BAD AND THINGS WILL CHANGE AND WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD YOU do not WANT THINGS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOOD AND CHANGE WOULD BE BAD %bcack BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT SOMETHING ELSE SO YOU WANT CHANGE BECAUSE YOU THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO GET BETTER THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER AND {it's / it is / it has} AMAZING THAT WE THINK THAT THEY ARE %bcack MY BOOK SAID THE SAME THING {it's / it is / it has} LIKE {that's / that is / that has} TRUE THAT IF THE news paper WOULD REVIEW THEM {they had / they would} CALL THEM BLEAK WELL YOU KNOW IF {you are / you were} NOT IF YOU do not THINK THINGS ARE BLEAK {you are / you were} NOT REALLY GRASPING {what's / what is / what has / what does} GOING ON YEAH YEAH WELL THAT KIND OF BRINGS UP FOR ME THE QUESTION OF THIS ONE MIGHT CALL THIS SOCIAL IMAGINARY OF USING A COUNTING SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE DAVID YOU WERE USING TEN LINES AND YOU KNOW {you are / you were} INVENTING THIS SORT OF COMBINATORY TWENTY POEMS TEN LINES EACH WITHIN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS IS THERE ANY ANYTHING THAT YOU ATTACHED TO %bcack %bcack OF SOME OF LARGER SOCIAL IMPORT TO THE USE OF THAT SORT OF COUNTING STRUCTURE OTHER THAN MERELY AS A AS A MEANS TO AN ENDING TO YOU NO ABSOLUTELY IT IT BEC every one COUNTS THE SAME %bcack every one IN THIS CULTURE COUNTS THE SAME SO I MEAN {we are / we were} AGREED ON TEN THEN TWENTY AND HOW YOU GET THERE YOU KNOW SO SO BECAUSE WELL {it's / it is / it has} HARD TO SINGLE ONE BOOK OUT BUT CERTAINLY THIS BOOK WAS CONCERNED WITH EPISTEMOLOGY AND HOW WHEN THE WORDS NEVER MEAN EXACTLY THE SAME THING FOR ANY ONE OF {us / u. s.} AS none the less OF SOCIETY IS POSSIBLE WHEREAS I WAS LOOKING FOR THINGS LIKE I WAS THINKING OF THINGS LIKE TEACHING CHILDREN TO READ TEACHING CHILDREN TO COUNT AND HOW THAT IS THERE AS SOME KIND OF OUTSIDE TO EACH ONE OF {us / u. s.} ALTHOUGH {it's / it is / it has} INSIDE {us / u. s.} YOU KNOW {that's / that is / that has} WHY {it's / it is / it has} OUTSIDE THERE {it's / it is / it has} INSIDE {us / u. s.} HERE AND I COULD SAY MORE ABOUT THAT BUT SEEMS MORE USEFUL TO KEEP RESPONSES TO LIKE A PARAGRAPH WHEN YOU SAID every one COUNTS THE SAME IN THIS CULTURE I THOUGHT BOY {that's / that is / that has} WAY NOT TRUE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MEANT SOME OF {us / u. s.} ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS OH NOT NO NO NO NO NO BUT THEY SHOULD {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT AND BUT YOU SEE YEAH BUT {that's / that is / that has} ALS BUT {that's / that is / that has} THE THE WAY YOU HEARD THAT STATEMENT IS ALSO CORRECT FOR THIS BOOK BECAUSE THERE I BELIEVE {there's / there is / there has} QUITE A BIT ABOUT SOCIAL INEQUITY IN THIS BOOK ALTHOUGH {it's / it is / it has} NOT CALLED BY THE USUAL TERMS JUST THAT THEY BECAUSE THEY HAD THEY HAD LENIN NOW they have GONE LIMP LIMP AFTER BEING SO SO LONG ENGORGED THAT THEY ARE NOW LIMP SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND REALLY FASCINATING ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS THAT IT ALLOWS ME AS A READER TO WATCH EACH OF YOU AS A WRITER TACKLING A NOT EXACTLY PARALLEL BUT {it's / it is / it has} THE CLOSEST THING TO IT PROJECT IN ESS IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SPACE READING THE {other's / other is / other has} WORK AND THEN CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING TO SAY OUT OF THAT PROCESS AND I AM INTRIGUED THAT BOTH OF YOU TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER I WOULD SAY FLIRT WITH NARRATIVE IN AS THOUGH IT WERE BEHIND OR RELATED TO THE TEXT YOU PICKING THE FILM THAT I TAKE IT HAS NOT EVER SEEN EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW I WHICH IS SO SYMMETRICAL SINCE THE FILMMAKER HAS ALSO NOT SEEN THE FILM THAT HIS FILM WAS BASED ON LOTS THAT HE %bcack RIGHT AND AND I AND I THINK DAVID DOES THAT AS WELL SUGGESTING A A NARRATIVE HE NEVER SPELLS OUT WITH PUNS AND MERIT AND SYMMETRIES AND AND AND N AND ACTUALLY NEVER BRINGING IT TO THE SURFACE BUT THEN he will BE BACK TO IT ON ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WHICH ACTUALLY SEEMS CLOSER TO THE RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR TEXT ACTUALLY AND ITS ITS RELATIONSHIP AND i am VERY INTRIGUED IN THE KIND OF PARALLELISM %bcack
