PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A Subject 0.644 406.333 You expect to be instructed by instructions and um you don't get very instructed by them you know And they're very French in the sense that you know it's just sort of kind of like French theory You're like reading along and you go What  You know  Can you run that by me again  Ha ha Ha um and I liked the way the wit  this quote was um similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry in in math i  a a symmetrical equation i it's the same in both directions You go though all of these procedures and it's the same so nothing actually happens and but all this stuff happens And so you start out with the same thing at either end and um a and I I was interested in that idea So it's a kind of i  it's a kind of stasis and then symmetry is a kind of stasis Hm and um uh but it's a it's a kind of quivery stasis that isn't really stasis because it just then it sort of collapses and then you have a kind of anti stasis So this this quote seemed to do that for me uh in a way that it was interesting and the only thing that I think that you take from it is a sense of symmetricality and that persistence in the situation And that relates to my reading of David which is to say you just have to stare into it and persist Mhm uh So I was just interested in evoking that It doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote it seems anti explanatory And yet it seems kind of to have an uh nuance to  er i  you know numinous quality to it I liked Yeah That was very clear in in so many points to just said that paragraph Yeah I'm taking notes Now that's  That's wonderful So So uh so things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry Well ye  i if asymmetry as you point out symmetry and not symmetry are the same So an asymmetry ass assumes lack of symmetry and so you know They make up symmetry yeah x So how do you ever get to change I mean how does one get  how does one how does one think that through so tha  how can one articulate that statement so that change is so that the fact of change is encompassed Think of death Yeah  It's changed I mean there's there's  somebody in in  I was just in buffalo and somebody said  asked me a question and it was uh Uhhuh Yeah uh What's your position on change Do you think change is  good Or are you against  change x  And uh  and I I said it just  it  you  we don't have a choice and uh it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes and uh uh and yo  when when things are bad you w  you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change And when things are good you don't want things to change because things are good and change would be bad Mhm But you always want something else so you want change because you think things are going to get better Things are not going to get better and it's amazing that we think that  they are Mhm My book said the same thing It's like  that's true um That  if the newspaper would review them they'd call them bleak Well you know if you're not  if you don't think things are bleak you're not really grasping  what's going on  Yeah Yeah Well that kind of brings up for me the question of this um one might call this social imaginary of um using um a counting Hm system um For example David you were using ten lines and uh you know you're inventing this sort of combinatory uh twenty poems ten lines each um within various combinations Is there any um  anything that you attached to Mhm mhm of um  some of larger social import to the use of that sort of counting structure other than merely as a as a means to an ending to you No absolutely It uh it bec  everyone counts the same Uhhuh Everyone in this culture counts the same So  I mean we're agreed on ten then twenty and how you get there you know So uh so because    well it's hard to single one book out but certainly this book was concerned with epistemology and  how when the words never mean exactly the same thing for any one of us as uh nonetheless of society is possible whereas I was looking for things like  i was thinking of things like teaching children to read teaching children to count and how that is there as some kind of outside to each one of us although it's inside us you know That's why it's outside there It's inside us here  And uh I could say more about that but seems more useful to keep responses to like a paragraph When you said Everyone counts the same in this culture I thought Boy that's way not true because I thought you meant   some of us are more equal than others  Oh not  no no no No No but they should That's right And but you see  yeah but that's als  but that's  the the way you heard that statement is also correct for this book because there  I believe there's quite a bit about social inequity in this book although it's not called by the usual terms Just that they uh  because they had they had Lenin Now they've gone limp  limp after being Hm so uh so long engorged that they are now limp So   One of the things that I find really fascinating about this whole process um is that it allows um me as a reader to watch each of you as a writer tackling a not exactly parallel but it's the closest thing to it project in ess in essentially the same space Reading the other's work and then constructing something to say out of that process And I am intrigued that both of you to one degree or another um I would say flirt with narrative in um as though it were behind or related to the text You picking the film that I take it has not ever seen um even though you know I  Which is so symmetrical since the filmmaker has also not seen the film that his film was based  on Lots that he  Mhm Right And and I and I think David does that as well suggesting a a narrative he never spells out with puns and merit and symmetries and and and n  and actually never bringing it to the surface but then he'll be back to it on on multiple occasions which actually seems closer to the relationship to your text actually and its its relationship and I'm very intrigued in the kind of parallelism  Uhhuh
