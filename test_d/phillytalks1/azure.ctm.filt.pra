REF:  you expect to be instructed by instructions and you do not get very instructed by them YOU KNOW and they are very french in the sense that you know it's JUST SORT OF kind of like french theory you are like reading along and YOU GO what YOU KNOW can you run that by me again *** and i liked the way the WIT this quote was similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry IN  in math I A a symmetrical equation I it's the same in both directions you go THOUGH  all of these procedures and it's the same so nothing actually happens and but all this stuff happens and so you start out with the same thing at either end and A and i i was interested in that idea so it's a kind of I it's a kind of stasis and then symmetry is a kind of stasis and but it's a it's a kind of quivery stasis that is not really stasis because it just then it sort of collapses and then you have a kind of ANTI STASIS     so this this quote seemed to do that for me in a way that IT was interesting and
