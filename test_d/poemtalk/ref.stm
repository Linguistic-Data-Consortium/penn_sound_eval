so to speak x Inner monologue when I  any one idea stands on stage for seven seconds so the idea has somehow become the presenter of the monologue That's e e  that's right I mean the question really becomes why why are we writing Who is it that's writing Why did that start writing What started writing What is writing to what And so on I mean there are all those questions that you know it  an I is it an I And I'm not so sure that I want to invest everything that I'm doing in any particular place one place because I think you know time and space are always going to be complicated and I don't think the writing comes out of any one place I think it comes out of this as I said this melange of of debris forces factors operators It's you know it's it's complex and so you have I'm really interested in But x but curiously here you you then  but you and I are here now Mhm Well I love that trying to bind Right I mean but it's an address you know x x To the supposition I I love I'll be Andy Warhol I'll be In other words we're going to try so  try some identity on for size Mhm I will be and you will be Everyone x You be you be you be Oh I thought you were talking about like Walgreens or something It's x over in aisle B x  Oh sorry That's alright You can add a big This is what we get with Bill x That's right um So but it's not I'll be George Patton I'll be some solid character  Mhm It's Andy Warhol Course Andy was actually a mirror You know whatever you know and Andy was not interested in identity selfhood and so if you and I are here now seems like a solid uh soci sociality you know an agreement that we can be meaning  we can make meaning together we can cocreate this thing that's happening here maybe in this poem um and then in doing so I'll be Andy Warhol and you be everyone else what we've established is a persona that is an antipersona  and set against that is a kind of an entire audience maybe everyone who reads this poem or who's sitting in in the crowd gets to be everyone else but it's not distinct from the I because I will be nothing and you will be nothing AntiTed talk AntiTed talk say a little more about antiTed talk because because I think Ted talk  I don't think that Larry was thinking of Ted talk but that is everything that's wrong with  speaking to an audience Yeah I think it's dislodging monologue from like its authoritarianism and it's making the the poem's existence is an invitation for a connection between audience and speaker x So it's not  it's it's inviting the collaboration of both parts that create the occasion for meeting anyway It's not I talk you listen I know you don't Yes It's Right it says which comes in parts of certainty the monologue doesn't have It's certain because of the relationship not because of what the monologue is saying Mhm That's right Before x we were talking about the I and I was disowning the I but at a certain point you actually have to own up to it You have to say Alright I'll take this on for this moment just for the a absolute fact fact of connection And that's not ironic in the least That's actually quite x Well x x ethical x absolutely it's ethical but is is irony unethical I don't think so No it isn't Hm x But th the problem with Ted talk ism is that they s  the implication is we need more than fifteen minutes of fame um you know we need we need to have a serious conservation you know and I've been through this and you're an audience who's listening to me and it's usually very personal and very philosophical but it's fact fifteen fucking minutes of fame A Ted talk You're trying to get through s  you want to get to a place where it's more than that I think Absolutely And at  I mean there's I mean x yes  I can't say anything more than that I mean I really agree with what you're saying I think that you know a again I  we've got lots of straw people around and th they walk around looking and sounding very important only because we elected them and you know we can just diselect them  I think and and when we do that we get to like take up altogether different roles in some kind of cooperative In this case x you know it's all stages of drama but obviously you know it's everywhere that we are so Bill thought another thought on this piece before turn to the third one Well x I love this typical inversion that we get here between a crowd and a empty stage or a stage and an empty crowd um That's kind of unfortunate isn't it  I mean I didn't want to imply that the crowd was empty altogether empty but I think that there's a possibility that's a lot of times it is because the crowd comes with expectations that invest the performance with more solidity and importance than it actually deserves and to me that  all that does is empty the crowd's expectations onto the stage where those expectations then act out I don't want that I want complete contingency I want the accident the unpredictable I want to y you know feel that there might be all kinds of encounters that happen you know at any given time We just need to be open to that x I think that's em embedded in though in that r
