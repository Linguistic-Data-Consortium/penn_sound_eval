INDIGNATION OF OWNER AND WAIT AROUND HIS FACE GIRL TAKES OFF THE HAT HE DOES NOT HAVE AND LOOKS EARNESTLY INTO THE EYES OF A GIRL THAT is not THERE THEN SMILES AND LOOKS ASIDE COYLY NO MONEY AND HE TURNS AWAY IN DISGUST TRAGIC TRAGIC TRAGIC I do not KNOW I HAS X i will CONTINUE WITH THIS AND MOVE HERE ABOUT A MINUTE BUT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO READ ABOUT PEOPLE I WONDER IF I CAN READ ABOUT A DOG THIS IS SOMEWHAT LONGER THE HIGHWAY I WAS WALKING ON WENT THROUGH A MARSH THERE WERE NO HOUSES NOTHING BUT THE MAR NO ONE ELSE WAS WALKING ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE BLAZING SUN I SAW THE DOG A HUNDRED FEET AWAY A BURLY FELLOW HALF CHOW I THOUGHT HALF GERMAN SHEPHERD SHAGGY HAIR PLASTERED WITH MUD THE DOG SAW ME TOO AND CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME I WALKED ON AFRAID THE DOG WOULD BITE I COULD HEAR THE NAILS OF HIS PAWS CLICKING ON THE PAVEMENT BUT HE PASSED ME NEVER LOOKED AT ME AND RAN ALONG AS I WALKED TEN OR TWENTY FEET AHEAD TEN OR TWENTY FEET BEHIND I DID NOT LIKE HIS LOOKS AT ALL THE HEAVY BROW THE SQUARE JAWS A SHAGGY DIRTY FELLOW THE ROAD WAS AS LONELY AS EVER MARSH UNDER THE BLAZING SKY AND THE MOTORCARS WENT SPEEDING PAST I COULD SEE THE PAVEMENT OF THE STREET ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THE BRIGHT BLUE SEA IT WOULD BE COOLER THERE AND I MIGHT BE RID OF THE DOG THE DOG LOOKED UP AFTER A WHILE SAW ME ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HE CAME TOWARDS ME STRAIGHT THROUGH THE TRAFFIC I STOOD STOCK STILL WAITING FOR THE DOG TO BE HIT SURE ENOUGH THE SECOND OR THIRD CAR STRUCK HIM AND SENT HIM SPRAWLING ON HIS BACK SQUEALING THE BRAKES OF THE CAR SCREECHED THE DOG LEAPED TO HIS FEET WAS KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN AND THEN CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME YOU DOPE I SAID BUT I WAS TOUCHED AT HIS DEVOTION NOW WE WENT ON SIDE BY SIDE THE DOG CLOSE TO ME AND I NO LONGER AFRAID NOW AND THEN WE CAME TO A STAIRWAY LEADING TO THE BEACH BELOW OTHER DOGS WHO WERE RUNNING ABOUT ON THE SAND AND THE DOG WAS EAGER TO GO DOWN BUT HE STOPPED WAITING FOR ME AT THE HEAD OF EACH STAIRWAY AND AS I WENT ON FOLLOWED THE STREET TURNED AT LAST AND WE WERE BACK ON THE HIGHWAY NOW I WAS AFRAID TO CROSS FOR FEAR THE DOG WOULD BE HIT HE STOOD BESIDE ME LOOKING UP AT ME WATCHING MY HANDS AND FEET READY TO SPRING FORWARD AT LAST THERE WAS A BREAK IN THE TRAFFIC ONLY TWO CARS COMING I COULD CROSS EASILY GO PART OF THE WAY LET THE CARS PASS AND THEN CROSS OVER BUT I WAS AFRAID THE DOG WOULD RUSH ON AND BE HIT NO I SAID OH NO AND WE WALKED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY with out CROSSING AS THE DOG RAN ON BESIDE ME STURDY AND TRUE I THOUGHT OF HIS LIFTED FACE THE DEEP BROWN EYES WATCHING MINE YES I SHOULD LIKE TO KEEP HIM WALKING SO TOGETHER WE CAME TO SOME HOUSES THESE WERE AT THE SEA COTTAGES REFRESHMENT STANDS EVEN A SMALL MERRY GO ROUND I STOPPED AT A STAND WHAT SHOULD I GET MY DOG TO EAT I ASKED THE PLEASANT GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER SHE SMILED AT ME AND LEANED OVER THE COUNTER TO SMILE AT THE DOG AS HE STOOD BESIDE ME WAGGING HIS TAIL HAMBURGER SHE SAID DOGS LOVE IT all right ONE OR TWO TWO SHE TOOK THE FRESH CAKES OUT OF THE ICEBOX AND PUT THEM ON A SQUARE OF WAX PAPER I WALKED TO THE CORNER OF THE STAND THE DOG FOLLOWED AND I PUT THE MEAT DOWN THE DOG LOOKED AT IT HIS TAIL DROOPED HIS EYES WERE GLAZED WITH FEAR AND HE WAS OFF AS FAST AS HE COULD GO BOLTING OVER THE SAND HILLS {that's / that is / that has} ABOUT IT NOW I LATE THE I HAVE DONE I THINK AS YOU HEARD THE YOUNG LADY READ SOME THINGS THAT I CALL TESTIMONY NOW THE FIRST TWO I DID WITH THIS NAME OR IN THIS ARE THE WATERS IN MANHATTAN NOW THEY ARE BASED THE TESTIMONY ARE ALL BASED ON CASES IN THE LAW REPORTS AND THIS IS THE FIRST THERE THAT I USED OF THE TWO THE COMPANY HAD ADVERTISED FOR MEN TO UNLOAD A STEAMER ACROSS THE RIVER IT WAS SIX OH CLOCK IN THE MORNING SNOWING AND STILL DARK THERE WAS A CROWD LOOKING FOR WORK ON THE DOCK AND ALL THE WHILE MEN HURRIED TO THE DOCK THE MAN AT THE WHEEL KEPT THE BOW KEPT THE BOW EXCUSE ME he will LAUNCH AGAINST THE DOCK THE ENGINE RUNNING SLOWLY AND THE MEN KEPT JUMPING FROM DOCK TO DECK FROM DOCK TO DECK JOSTLING EACH OTHER AND CROWDING INTO THE CABIN EIGHTY OR NINETY MEN WERE IN THE CABIN AS THE LAUNCH PULLED AWAY THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE CABIN AND NO ROOM TO TURN who ever WAS SITTING DOWN COULD NOT GET UP AND who ever HAD HIS HAND UP COULD NOT GET IT DOWN AS LAUNCH RAN IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE ICE ICE CRACKING AGAINST THE LAUNCH THUMPING AND SCRAPING AGAINST THE LAUNCH BANGING UP AGAINST IT UNTIL IT STRUCK A SOLID CAKE OF ICE ROLLED TO ONE SIDE AND SLOWLY GAINED BACK TO AN EVEN KEEL THE MEN BEGAN TO FEEL WATER RUNNING AGAINST THEIR FEET AS IF FROM A HOSE CAP SHOUTED ONE THE BOAT IS TAKING WATER
