Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_St-Marks_NY A Subject 0.197 465.913 TO FALL AT OUR FEET LIKE CROCUSES ALL OF OUR LIVES IS A REBUS OF LITTLE WOODEN ANIMALS PAINTED SHY TERRIFIC COLORS MAGNIFICENT AND HORRIBLE CLOSE TOGETHER THE MESSAGE IS LEARNED THE WAY LIGHT AT THE EDGE OF A BEACH IN AUTUMN IS LEARNED THE SEASONS ARE SUPERIMPOSED IN NEW YORK WE HAVE WINTER IN AUGUST AS THEY DO IN ARGENTINA AND AUSTRALIA SPRING IS LEAFY AND COLD AUTUMN PALE AND DRY THE AND CHANGES BUILD UP FOREVER LIKE BIRDS RELEASED INTO THE LIGHT OF AN AUGUST SKY FALLING AWAY FOREVER TO DEFINE THE HANDFUL OF THINGS WE KNOW FOR SURE FOLLOWED BY MUSICAL EVENINGS YES FRIENDS THESE CLOUDS PULLED ALONG ON INVISIBLE ROPES ARE AS YOU HAVE GUESSED MERELY STAGE MACHINERY AND THE FUNNY THING IS IT KNOWS WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND STILL WANTS {us / u. s.} TO GO ON BELIEVING IN WHAT IT SO UNSKILLFULLY IMITATES AND WANTS TO BE LOVED NOT FOR THAT BUT FOR ITSELF THE MURKY ATMOSPHERE OF A PARK TATTERED FOLIAGE WISE OLD TREE TRUNKS RAINBOW TISSUE PAPER WADDED CLOUDS DOWN NEAR WHERE THE PERSPECTIVE INTERSECTS THE SUNSET SO WE MAY KNOW WE TOO ARE some how IMPOSSIBLE FORMED OF SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS TOO MANY TO MAKE SENSE TO ANYBODY WE STRAGGLE ON AS QUOTIENTS HARD TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS AND WHAT CONTINUES DOES SO WITH OUR PARTICIPATION AND CONSENT TRY MILK OF TEARS BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME THE DANDELIONS WILL HAVE TO KNOW WHY AND YOUR COMIC DIRGE ROUTINE WILL BE LOST ON THE UNFOLDING SHEAVES OF THE WIND A LUCKY ONE THOUGH IT WILL CARRY YOU TOO FAR TO SOME MANAGEABLE COLD OPEN SHORE OF SORROWS YOU EXPECTED TO REACH THEN LEAVE BEHIND THUS FRIEND THIS DISTILLED DISPERSED MUSK OF MOVING AROUND THE PRODUCT OF LEAF AFTER TRANSPARENT LEAF OF TOO MANY COMINGS AND GOINGS VISITORS AT ALL HOURS EACH NIGHT IS TRIFOLIATE STRANGE TO THE TOUCH THIS ONE AGAIN APPROPRIATE TO THE WEATHER {it's / it is / it has} CALLED WET CASEMENTS PREFACED BY A THE FIRST SENTENCE OF KAFKA'S STORY WEDDING PREPARATIONS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS WHEN EDWARD RABAN COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE WALKED INTO THE OPEN DOORWAY HE SAW THAT IT WAS RAINING IT WAS NOT RAINING MUCH THE CONCEPTION IS INTERESTING TO SEE AS THOUGH REFLECTED IN STREAMING WINDOW PANES THE LOOK OF OTHERS THROUGH THEIR OWN EYES A DIGEST OF THEIR CORRECT IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR SELF ANALYTICAL ATTITUDES OVERLAID BY YOUR GHOSTLY TRANSPARENT FACE YOU IN FALBALAS OF SOME DISTANT BUT NOT TOO DISTANT ERA THE COSMETICS THE SHOES PERFECTLY POINTED DRIFTING HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEEN DRIFTING HOW LONG I HAVE TOO FOR THAT MATTER LIKE A BOTTLE IMP TOWARD A SURFACE WHICH CAN NEVER BE APPROACHED NEVER PIERCED THROUGH INTO THE TIMELESS ENERGY OF A PRESENT WHICH WOULD HAVE ITS OWN OPINIONS ON THESE MATTERS ARE AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL SNAPSHOT OF THE PROCESSES THAT FIRST MENTIONED YOUR NAME AT SOME CROWDED COCKTAIL PARTY LONG AGO AND SOMEONE NOT THE PERSON ADDRESSED OVERHEARD IT AND CARRIED THAT NAME AROUND IN HIS WALLET FOR YEARS AS THE WALLET CRUMBLED AND BILLS SLID IN AND OUT OF IT I WANT THAT INFORMATION VERY MUCH TODAY {can not / cannot} HAVE IT AND THIS MAKES ME ANGRY I SHALL USE MY ANGER TO BUILD A BRIDGE LIKE THAT OF AVIGNON ON WHICH PEOPLE MAY DANCE FOR THE FEELING OF DANCING ON A BRIDGE I SHALL AT LAST SEE MY COMPLETE FACE REFLECTED NOT IN THE WATER BUT IN THE WORN STONE FLOOR OF MY BRIDGE I SHALL KEEP TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT REPEAT OTHERS COMMENTS ABOUT ME READ ABOUT TWO OR THREE MORE THIS ONE IS CALLED PYROGRAPHY WHICH IS REFERS TO THE WOOD BURNING KIT YOU PROBABLY HAD OR I DID ANYWAY WHEN I WAS A CHILD MAKING PICTURES ON WOOD WITH AN ELECTRIC NEEDLE OUT HERE ON COTTAGE GROVE IT MATTERS THE GALLOPING WIND BALKS AT ITS SHADOW THE CARRIAGES ARE DRAWN FORWARD UNDER A SKY OF FUMED OAK THIS IS AMERICA CALLING THE MIRRORING OF STATE TO STATE A VOICE TO VOICE ON THE WIRES THE FORCE OF COLLOQUIAL GREETINGS LIKE GOLDEN POLLEN SINKING ON THE AFTERNOON BREEZE IN SERVICE STARES THE SWEET CORRUPTION THRIVES THE PAGE OF DUSK TURNS LIKE A CREAKING REVOLVING STAGE IN WARREN OHIO IF THIS IS THE WAY IT IS let us LEAVE THEY AGREE AND SOON THE SLOW BOX CAR JOURNEY BEGINS GRADUALLY ACCELERATING UNTIL THE GYRATING FAN OF SUBURBS ENFOLDING THE DARKNESS OF CITIES ARE REMEMBERED ONLY AS A RECURRING TICK AND MID MIDWAY WE MEET THE DISAPPOINTED RETURNING ONES with out ITS BEING ABLE TO STOP {us / u. s.} IN THE HEADLONG NIGHT TOWARD THE NOTHING OF THE COAST AT BOLINAS THE HOUSES DOZE AND SEEM TO WONDER WHY THROUGH THE PACIFIC HAZE AND THE DREAMS ALTERNATELY GLOW AND GROW DULL WHY BE HANGING ON HERE LIKE KITES CIRCLING SLIPPING ON A RAMP OF AIR BUT ALWAYS CIRCLING BUT THE VARIABLE CLOUDINESS IS POURING IT ON FLOODING BACK TO YOU LIKE THE MEANING OF A JOKE THE LAND was not IMMEDIATELY APPEALING WE BUILT IT PARTLY OVER WITH FAKE RUINS IN THE IMAGE OF OURSELVES AN ARCH THAT TERMINATES IN MID KEYSTONE A CRUMBLING STONE PIER FOR LAUNDRESSES AN OPEN AIR THEATER NEVER COMPLETED AND ONLY PARTIALLY DESIGNED HOW ARE WE TO INHABIT THIS SPACE FROM WHICH THE FOURTH WALL IS INVARIABLY MISSING AS IN A STAGE SET OR DOLLHOUSE EXCEPT BY STAYING AS WE ARE IN LOST PROFILE FACING THE STARS WITH DOZENS OF AS YET UNrealiseD PROJECTS AND A STRICT SENSE OF TIME RUNNING OUT OF EVENING PRESENTING THE TACTFULLY FOLDED OVER BILL AND WE FIT RATHER TOO EASILY INTO IT BECOME TRANSPARENT ALMOST GHOSTS ONE DAY THE BIRDS AND ANIMALS IN THE PASTURE HAVE ABSORBED THE COLOR THE DENSITY OF THE SURROUNDINGS THE LEAVES ARE ALIVE AND TOO HEAVY WITH LIFE A LONG PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT FOLLOWED IN THE CITIES AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY THEY KNEW ABOUT IT
