>> REF:  interesting YEAH A LITTLE BIT YEAH YEAH %BCACK YEAH THAT'S HE'S LOVED FOR THAT TIME %BCACK IT'S GREAT no i D i do not have any DISAGREEMENT  WITH   WHAT has just been SAID I    i think that the moment ONE recognises AN ALTERITY WITHIN ONE'S SELF ONE IS          %BCACK recognizing the RECIPROCITY of ALL ALTERITY BECAUSE ALTERITY    is not only ABOUT others outside of ONESELF and i do think that the vectors of ALTERITIES   go in in many directions THAT that in itself is is not a very full statement but it but it LEADS to the QUESTION    OR    it raises questions of the nature of practices within a a ***** WORLDSCAPE where you can BE  mapping reciprocal ALTERITIES   rather than mapping less than ALTERITIES IN THE %BCACK YEAH %BCACK X %BCACK I HAVE    A   question about that ****** NOW THING i think i am GOING TO        it makes a lot of sense THAT that is how you get there but i think A AN  AWFUL LOT  to say ** is possible to recognise WITNESS  WITHIN themselves and not RELATE  
>> HYP:  interesting **** * ****** *** **** **** ****** **** ****** **** ***** *** **** **** ****** TO   I     no i * i do not have any DISAGREEMENTS BEFORE THIS has just been **** SENT i think that the moment IT  recognises ** ******** ****** ***** **** ARE ALTERNATIVE ON     recognizing the RESPONSE    of *** ******** ALTER   ALTERNATIVE is not only ALL   others outside of ME      and i do think that the vectors of ALTERNATIVES go in in many directions BUT  that in itself is is not a very full statement but it but it NEEDS to the QUESTIONING WHERE it raises questions of the nature of practices within a a WORLD ESCAPE     where you can SEE mapping reciprocal ALTERNATIVES rather than mapping less than ********** ** *** ****** **** ****** * ****** * HELPING YOU question about that THOUGH I   MEAN  i think i am ***** WONDERING it makes a lot of sense BUT  that is how you get there but i think I HAD ALSO  LIKE to say IT is possible to recognise BUSINESS FOR    themselves and not RELATED
