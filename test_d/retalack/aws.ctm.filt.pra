>> REF:  GREAT     NO i D i do not have any disagreement with what's just been said i i think that the moment one recognises an ALTERITY    within ONE'S SELF    one is %BCACK recognizing the reciprocity of ALL ALTERITY BECAUSE ALTERITY is not only about others outside of ******* ONESELF and i do think that the vectors of *** ALTERITIES go in in many directions that that in itself is is not a very full statement but it but it leads to THE question OR    it raises questions of the nature of practices within a a ***** WORLDSCAPE where you can be mapping reciprocal ALTERITIES rather than mapping LESS THAN ALTERITIES IN THE %BCACK YEAH %BCACK X   %BCACK i have a question about that ****** NOW THING i think i AM   GOING TO   it makes a lot of sense that that is how you get there but i think * A AN  AWFUL LOT  to say ** is possible to recognise WITNESS    within themselves and not relate to still be able to LIKE  to the other and not AND not RELATE you know not THAT'S RIGHT not MOVE in that 
>> HYP:  DIFFERENT SO i * i do not have any disagreement with what's just been said i i think that the moment one recognises an ALTERNATIVE within ***** HIMSELF one is ****** recognizing the reciprocity of *** ******** VOLAR   TERN     is not only about others outside of WOMEN'S HEALTH  and i do think that the vectors of ALL CHARITIES  go in in many directions that that in itself is is not a very full statement but it but it leads to A   question WHERE it raises questions of the nature of practices within a a WORLD ESCAPE     where you can be mapping reciprocal CHARITIES  rather than mapping **** **** ********** ** *** ****** US   THEM   TER THESE  i have a question about that THOUGH I   MEAN  i think i MEAN I     MEAN it makes a lot of sense that that is how you get there but i think I I HAD ALSO  LIKE to say IT is possible to recognise DIFFERENCE within themselves and not relate to still be able to POINT to the other and not *** not REALLY you know not ****** ***** not NEW  in that
