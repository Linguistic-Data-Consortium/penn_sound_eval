Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A Subject 0.207 349.904 NOWADAYS i am MORE OR LESS CONTENT TO LET A LOT OF THINGS TAKE THEIR OWN COURSES LIKE AMIABLE RIVERS MAKING BLUE LINES DOWN THE MAP OF HISTORY i am NOT SAYING THAT SOME THINGS do not INFURIATE ME THEY CERTAINLY DO BUT i have LEARNED MOSTLY THROUGH STUPID REPETITION THE SAME PATIENCE I APPLY TO MY OWN WORKS MOVING THEM OUT OF RANGE OF GOOD AND EVIL IS APPLICABLE IN A ROMANTIC WAY I GUESS TO THINGS NATURAL AND UNNATURAL OUTSIDE MYSELF i am ON BETTER TERMS THOUGH STILL ABLE TO BEAR GRUDGES WITH MOST THINGS AND PEOPLE MORE SOCIAL SOCIALLY AMIABLE NO LONGER STAND IN A CORNER AT PARTIES FACING INTO THE WALL SMELLING THE SCHOOL LIKE PLASTER GETTING PLASTERED NOW I TALK IT UP AND EVEN WHEN DOWN NEVER TALK DOWN BUT REMAIN SUBDUED i have LEARNED TO LIKE WINTERS MORE BUT HATE THE END OF SAME FEEL RELIEF AT SPRING CRAVE SUN ON BODY ENTER THROUGH THE LOBBY OF ANNUAL DEPRESSION HAVE GREATER SENSE OF PERSONAL COMFORT EXPANDING HORIZONS ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND KNOW HOW FAR i will GO TO DO IN THIS YEAR OF FAMINE AND PESTILENCE HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP MY MIND AND EAR COCKED LIKE A GUN FOR THE TRUE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE TO GO OFF AND FILL THE SKY OF THE MIND WITH ANGELS CONVERSING AND HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY LEFT TO REMEMBER AND WRITE THE ANGELS DOWN with out PINNING A SINGLE BODY OR WING I HAVE FINALLY RETURNED TO THE CHEERFULNESS I HAD WHEN VERY YOUNG BEFORE THE BUBBLES IN MY PERSONAL SELTZER HAD GONE FLAT WHEN THE FINGERS OF SCHOOL HAVING OPENED MY THINKING PAT HAVING OPENED MY THINKING CAP KEPT THE BOTTLE OPEN LONG ENOUGH TO LET THE FUN OUT AMIDST THE MULTITUDE OF OTHERS ASKING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER what ever HAPPENED TO YOU YOU WERE SUCH A CHEERFUL KID AND THAT I AM WHIFF AN EVENING SPENT TALKING SPENT THINKING ABOUT WHAT MY LIFE WOULD BE IF {i had / i would} STAYED WITH A PARTICULAR GIRL OR WOMAN I WENT WITH WHAT WOULD BE IF {i had / i would} HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO AND GONE WHERE I APPLIED TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL THAN THE ONE I DID WHERE {i had / i would} LEARN DIFFERENT SOCIAL GRACES THAN THE ONES I HAVE WHERE SOME OF THE MATERIAL VALUES OF THE AMERICAN DREAM HAD RUBBED OFF ENOUGH TO MAKE ME LIVE IT OUT IN THE GOOD WORK SENSE IF {i had / i would} SETTLED DOWN AND SETTLED FOR THE FOUNDATION ON A HOUSE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS INSTEAD OF ASSUMING IMMEDIATE IMMEDIATELY PAST GENERATIONS MY FOUNDATION TO MINE IF {i had / i would} HAVE BEEN A LITTLE QUICKER TO LEARN WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME AND WANTING TO PLEASE PLEASED GOING ON THAT WAY THROUGH ALL ETERNITY i have PROBABLY BEEN SAVED FROM MERE ROUTINES BY A STREAK OF STUBBORNNESS BY A SLOW MIND AND TENDENCY TO DRIFT BY AN EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT REQUIRES MY PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING BEFORE HAPPENING FEELING OUT THE IMPLICATIONS AN EMOTION HAS IN FORM OF EXPECTATION BEFORE TRYING OUT AND AFTER AWARENESS I SENSE A WILLINGNESS TO TELL SOMEONE I KNOW AND LIKE AND SENSE THE SAME FROM ANYTHING {they had / they would} LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ME AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A VAST SENSE OF PRIVACY WHICH MEANS {there's / there is / there has} NO WAY i will WEAR OUT MY PERSONALITY AND ITS SENSE OF CONTINUITY ALTHOUGH some timeS I FEEL EMPTY BUT TALKING TO SOMEONE I LIKE AND TRUST AND SENSE THE SAME FROM I FEEL WAY UP AND AFTER A LONG EVENING OF TALK ABOUT THIS AND THAT FEEL WIDE AWAKE AND FEEL THE WORLD WIDE AND AWAKE AROUND ME AND HAVE A VISUAL INTENSITY AND MEMORY THAT IN NEAR MEMORY DULLS AND THROBS AND GROWS VIVID AS HELL WHEN I BRING IT TO MIND SOME TIME FROM THEN WHAT MY LIFE would have BEEN LIKE UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES IT would have BEEN DIFFERENT WITH ITS OWN ATTENDANT IFS AND ITS OWN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT THIS WAY i have ELECTED TO FOLLOW AND CAST MY VOTE EACH WAKING DAY IN I AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING THE PAST TOO SERIOUSLY OR FEELING ANY BITTERNESS OR SADNESS THIS WAY WHEN MY SHIP COMES IN i will HAVE PASSED OUT OF MIND BEYOND THE SIGHT OF LAND AND will not HESITATE FOR A SECOND TO LOOK BACK ON ALL THIS WITH FONDNESS OR REMISS THE AIR'LL BE CLEAR THE MOON'LL BE THERE AND YOU who ever YOU ARE AND HOPE TO BE WILL BE HERE WITH MY LOVE NINTH STREET OLD PEOPLE OLD PEOPLE LARGE CLOUDS HIGH
