Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A Subject 1.189 467.961 THE EXHILARATION COMES UP VERY CLOSE THE OBJECTS IN IT LOOK LIKE FAMILIAR THINGS IT HAPPENS AT TIMES THAT COME TO {us / u. s.} IN A DIRECT LINE AS LIGHT MOVING AT A PRETTY PACE PEOPLE IN DELIRIUM MOVE TOWARD IT IT HAS ONE OF NATURE'S FAILINGS LOVELINESS IS NOT DELUXE WHEN {it's / it is / it has} UNCERTAIN STRANGE WE HAVE COME BACK SO THIS TYPE STUDY IS WHAT STARTED ALL THE TROUBLE WITH ANY OTHERS COMING {i had / i would} LONG BEEN A FAN OF HER WORK AND HAD ON WEAVING AND KNEW IT WELL IT had not I JUST SAW IT DIFFERENTLY ONE DAY AND I WENT TO SOME LENGTHS TO TRY TO PUBLISH IT AND IT TOOK A LOT JUST WANTED TO COVER THE THINGS THAT I DO AND THAT THAT AND THEY PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHOR'S FOUNDATION WHICH OPENED UP A LITTLE BIT OF A PANDORA'S BOX BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT OUT SO MANY AMAZING THINGS WHEN I WENT TO VISIT I WAS THEN IN SO I STUDIED WEAVING AND THEN STARTED WORKING ON MY OWN LITTLE TYPE STUDIES AND I do not KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT WHEN I DO MONOTONOUS WORK LIKE HAMMERING AWAY ON A YOU KNOW A GRIDDED TYPEWRITER SPACE LIKE THIS i am ALWAYS LISTENING TO THINGS SO AT THIS POINT I WAS LISTENING TO A L REALLY AMAZING INTERVIEW WITH SUSAN HOWE AND CHARLES BERNSTEIN {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THE THE VERY EARLY LINE BREAK AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH BUT THEY JUST THEY HAD THIS STELLAR CONVERSATION ABOUT LANDSCAPE AND PAGE SPACE WHERE SUSAN HOWE EQUATES PAGE SPACE TO FREEDOM SALT AND SAND THIS IS ANNIE AND JOSEPH HAD BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE AND THIS IS LAURA COUNTY LIVINGFIELD ONE OF {annie's / annie is / annie has} STUDENTS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE TO GRADUATE FROM BLACK MOUNTAIN AS I RECALL AND SHE TOOK THE WEAVING COURSE FROM ANNIE AND FROM ANOTHER TEACHER THERE AND THANKFULLY GOT LIKE TWO HUNDRED PAGES OF EXTRAORDINARY NOTES ALL HAND TYPED WITH LOTS OF DRAFT NOTATION AND DRAWINGS AND WHILE I WAS AT THE ELDER'S ARCHIVE OR ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT UP THERE AFTER I DIGITIZED HER ENTIRE FILE BECAUSE IT WAS DE DETERIORATING RATHER RAPIDLY AND MAYBE OF LESSER VALUE THAN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THERE SO I SCANNED IT AND I HAVE IT AND NOW i am JUST WONDERING WONDERING WHAT TO DO i am going to GIVE A TALK IN A FEW DAYS ON THE ARCHIVE BUT LIKE OTHER PROJECTS IT TAKES ME A LONG TIME TO SORT OF GET FAR ENOUGH TO THAT I KNOW WHAT i am DOING WITH SOMETHING SO I JUST SPENT A LOT OF TIME LEARNING I DID TRACE THE TYPE STUDIES FROM BLACK MOUNTAIN BACK TO THE BAUHAU THIS IS A A WEAVING CLOTH SAMPLE BOOK OF SOME OF THE TYPE DESIGNS THIS IS MY favourITE BAUHAUS STUDY DONE BY HAJA ROSE OF JUST ZEROES AND LINES is not IT GORGEOUS SO {it's / it is / it has} A MILLION RANDOM DIGITS SEE I TOTALED THEM UP YEAH THINK JOHN CAGE USED THIS QUITE A BIT TRACK SOME OF THEM DOWN SO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAVE OR MIGHT WEAVE WOULD KNOW THAT WEAVING'S ALL ABOUT NUMBERS SO EVERY THREAD EVERY INTERSECTION OF THE THREAD CORRESPONDS TO AT LEAST TWO NUMBERS SO EVEN THOUGH {you are / you were} LOOKING AT A VERY SIMPLE PIECE OF CLOTH YOU COULD REALLY DRAW IT OUT NUMERICALLY IN ITS ENTIRETY SO THE PIECE THAT I DID FOR THE THE BOOK WAS SIMPLY A TRANSCRIPTION A LOVELY TRANSCRIPTION OF THAT PAGE SPACE I WAS GIVING A TALK RECENTLY AND THEN I DID A LITTLE HOMEWORK ON ETYMOLOGY OF TEXT AND TEXTILE AND THEY COME FROM THE VERY SAME STEM TO WEAVE BUT I LOVE THE TEXT ACTUALLY HAS A EVEN A MORE FABRIC DESCRIPTION OF STYLE TISSUE OF LITERARY WORK LITERALLY THAT WHICH IS WOVEN WEB TEXTURE SO NICE THE WAY {it's / it is / it has} THERE SO THERE EARLY ON SO {that's / that is / that has} IT THOUGHT WE COULD OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS YOU GAVE {us / u. s.} HAVE PLENTY OF TIME i am CURIOUS ABOUT THE DICKINSON QUOTES I NOTICE FROM THE IMAGES THAT THERE WERE IT SEEM IT SEEMED TO ME SPECIFICALLY THAT {there's / there is / there has} A BUNCH OF SIMILAR MARKINGS BUT {they are / they were} SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DO THEY CORRESPOND TO A CERTAIN THING LIKE FROM THE WORK LIKE THE THE THE THE THE WAY THAT YOU SEWED THE FABRIC IN JUST THE PREGNANT DID IT LIKE HOW DOES THAT HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WHAT TO PUT WHERE RIGHT {it's / it is / it has} AS FAITHFUL A TRANSCRIPTION AS I COULD MAKE SO WHAT I DID WAS I SCANNED DICKINSON'S MANUSCRIPT BOOKS WHICH YOU YOU HAVE HERE YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC DICKINSON COLLECTION SO {it's / it is / it has} A TWO VOLUME BOOK OF THE FOLIO WORK THAT SHE DID AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY A A TON MORE MANU HER MANUSCRIPTS THAT are not IN THAT EDITION SO THAT ARE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL EVEN THE STRANGE THE LIGHT FRAGMENTS BUT I WORKED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT SHOWED THE VARIANT SYSTEM SO ALL THOSE CROSSES THAT YOU SAW EMBROIDERED PRECEDE WORDS AND THE WORDS CORRESPOND TO OTHER WORDS PRECEDED BY A CROSS WITHIN THE POEM SO {there's / there is / there has} THIS RATHER INTENSE SYSTEM OF ALTERNATE OR OTHER WAYS TO READ POEMS AND {they are / they were} VERY STRANGE I MEAN some timeS {they are / they were} CLOSE LIKE LIKE FURTHER AND FARTHER WHICH are not REALLY CLOSE AT ALL AND some timeS {they are / they were} LIKE LIKE THE LINES LIKE 'TIS IS 'TIS AS IF OUR SOULS ABSCONDED SUDDENLY AND THE VARIANT IS SOULS AND THE VARIANTS BELOW THE POEM ARE WORLD SELVES AND SUN OH OH SO EITHER ANY OF THOSE COULD HAPPEN AND THEN WHEN YOU START TO READ THE VARIANTS WHA BETWEEN POEMS SO SAY SOULS I IS A VARIANT MORE THAN ONCE THEN YOU HAVE A VERY COMPLEX WAY THAT YOU START TO GET TO READ YEAH X
