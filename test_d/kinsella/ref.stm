Kinsella-John_02_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_11-6-96 A Subject 0.824 393.949 Faustus Glamor From the gaming table to the early opener a risk of needles stick not obvious for the first mescal first sex traps the skirt the dance floor and I its center A lavender squirrel opaque with dry ice a paradox of people cloistered in the wild the state of nature realigning the recognition in a drama of substances the solitary actor holding the cup high projecting his voice at the light excelling calling for more   the recognition inadequate a ploy a foil  This is um a poem called Echidna Echidna is um a porcupine like animal found in Australia It's a marsupial um monotreme um It produces eggs um and suckles its young in a pouch so it's a strange combination of creatures It has a duck  uh I mean it has a uh a kind of pointed um nose It's uh it's quite bony and strange It's cross  the closest animal to it is in fact platypus which has a duck like bill and is also a monotreme uh and this poem's for Jacques Derrida for reasons which will be obvious Rhythmically burrowing up on the top road in the grated remainders the swampy contours that look good for digging that you'd like to get amongst and smell Those substratas more than dirt and roots rhizomic agendas of the feeble eyed uttering up refrains from where compactness and density are demarcation and territory where decaying mallee root or corpse of storm felled wandoo tan the leathery bag of muscled fluid The flow of ants as white as Moby Dick as determined against the pulpy hole of trees as against the gritted surface Down here where the highway is sensed in the movement of sand particles the Ericsson is tree chair determinedly sits In English hedgehog excavates At risk this bristling heart litters the road with dedication symbols of the national psyche left to bloat in the sun's glistening blistering prosody In separation that mimes mechanics on the surface by heart that with foo  without footnotes is still recognized as the source of undermovings I consider as memory cracking an echidna with a farmer in Jam Tree country locating the spirit of place as if its being curled in a tree hollow might validate the vast spread of open tillage But struck by a kind of amnesia we wandered in a circle tight as a fist exhuming the deeply choric question of rendering our meanderings into prose into idle chatter to accompany a few beers in the pub that night The portfolio of our imagined data presented with detachment as the slow moving underminer of our confident lyrical souls fed ravenously deep in the heart of the forest I'd like to now read very something different now um from from the Undertow It's from a long poem written an number of years ago called Syzygy which created something of a controversy in Australia when it came out  Two Fallout A refugee from contention I load stills into the projector taking a negative impression adjuncting expression prizing anger out of its folds the damage budding retentive small experiment releasing heat Remember looting these impressions Machinery expressive and light conscious love scarifying poise the tractor rocketing the clods of loamy earth bootlegging frustration mudbrick and fencewire circular saws threatening Robert Frost and doorpost jamming two years too old and rotting the sun orange plastic perfect the film was black and white and the sheep gurgling hysterically Three self regarding homonculus metal chambers tinfoiling exclusions like humidicribs wheeling slick asphalt deletions and striping film dust water licking axminster carpet spreadsheets What shows in the headlights or pinheaded spotlight Crunch Synthetic victims And the frogs croak politely in their ditches Halt Good year wet weather halts the death of a zebra just outside the butcher's shop Can't read the signs good who gives a damn anyway Needed inquire within Good management and sensible market indicators Those who leave anything up to description need not remote opinions Morality stinks we keep it in buckets Four When the Flappers Tickle Your Fancy Opposing needs priming pellegra with plastic cement like jelly rubber singing aging movies tall tales lugging drabness out of forums Humitrophic water glass or sundial gas bagging in the shade ah such is fame passing the time The car comes A stretch in tails Silk doors predella adjuncting driver and talent Let us in Taking us entire rhomboidal all and ooh la la sursurrous through disconnection baffling sibilance Oh my flappers what a team we make And the planets cohabitate and read life impression you have your strict and your lax the cups drink too much and the television in the back of the limo is stuck on the same channel The driver is sucking himself Take no notice You are my family he splurges Executors guardians trustees receivers inheritors good sides half backs  contrivers emissaries agitators incarnations lovers leaping into the tired pile of my flesh Five The Cane Cutter Reflex take a breath A snake operates amongst rough cane cutterâ€™s crystalline sweat A particle overload Heavy rain bearing down palpitating trifolate with sun and cane no rainbow makes an appearance Earthy very earthy Miasma camouflaged mud takers all takers  and throws back the marsh of fences They beg for tariffs They like restrictions In the highlands water is lightning gaping press down and half bas relief Turbine churn it comes down from highlife uh  where the air is heady No fireflies there Dowsed and riddled deep deep south roots grow  dry bone black subterranean streams raddled shapes forking azurine on making uh archaeological light spent swarming the traps for this is Ground Zero Warholing in cyclone territory zoning the sirens equivocating hot dogs and pies mushrooms pushed to the side of the plate Cadillacs racketing Monroe hubcaps currency cut like love on the breezy day
