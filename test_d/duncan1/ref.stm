Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Albuquerque_02-29-64 A Subject 0.308 423.388 Teaching the mind not to find the sun's rind Setting the whole house into an uproar Is it one Is it tone Is it imagination What words are you looking for In a mimeographed lesson of Doctor Quimby on the subconscious I find he also calls it The Book and he said We are not any wiser than the book we have written where the bees came in came to mind from their place or time into this place misplaced when I remembered not where the book was but their song in the sun On June eighth nineteen sixty one news came that H D had had a stroke In July Norman Holmes Pearson wrote The part of the brain which controls speech has been injured so that she cannot recall appropriate words at will Yet she does have fitfully the desire to communicate and strikes her breast in pass passionate frustration when there is no word at her tongue's tip Sometimes whole sentences will come sometimes everything but the key word So it is I want but one can never tell what it is she wants Dove Mother of mouthings The gray doves in your many branches code and decode what warnings we can recall of loved watery tones  She raises the bedroom window to let in the air and pearl gray light of morning where the first world stripped of its names extends where initial things go beckoning doves sounds recur taking what we know of them when the soul leaps to the tongue's tip as if to tell what secret in the word fort The bird's claw scraping the ledges I hear the rustling of wings Is it evening The woodwinds chortling a piping sound settling down in the dark pit where the orchestra lights glow as the curtain rises and in the living room at another stage lamps are lit The lady in the shade is about held in doves in her two hands let it fly up from the bowl she made as if a word had left her lips Now that the song has flown the tree shapes rustling in the wind with no stars of its own for all the nets of words are gone The lady holds nothing in her two hands top the catches of the ears are torn and the wood light floods and overflows the bowl she holds like a question Voices of children from playgrounds come sounding on the wind without names We cannot tell who they are there We were once too under what star Before words afterwards hands lifted to the bowl for water arms to prayer For what we heard was no more than a dove     Where the day slept afternoon and the lights blur and strayed the queen of the trees talking hears only the leaf sound  of wings in the bough The voices in the wind verging into leaf sound I wanted to say something That my heart had such a burden or needed a burden in order to say something Take what masks define words and as an old man come forward into a speech he had long waited for had on the tip of his tongue from which now Oh fateful thread sensitive to my song most moved Now from your courses the flame had fled making but words of what I loved Going to read now this  I I can't find  just a breath  Form I haven't worked on and so it won't got beat  uh and and anyway this form is is intended as uh sequences of light  I've I've uh been more um and and and I went through a period which I reacted against the cantos because it seemed to me that Pound is always i i  after all we had no other poems but the cantos since Pound began on the cantos I've many different fascinations with the cantos They've always been essential I began with the cantos at about the age of eighteen or nineteen and and all my life have  had many different ideas of them Now recently I've been haunted by them again and they seem to me this time to open up a great freedom uh a a And that is a freedom in the relation to the way in which I compose things thematically all the way through And and and I thought if I were to open up let's say just call something just passages as you might call something just fragments Try to prevent it from forming into a poem and it's a Pindar poem or apprehension formed into a turtle that's symphonic The symphonic form uh uh or or the sonata form fascinated me uh They  uh I like to orchestrate a large form I like to have related movements and and and boxe  poems within poems a an and now I wanted to see if I could let that loose uh Now of course I can't do it immediately You'll find thematic progressions in this but but I have begun this poem in order to see if I can if I can open up and eventually have some of these passages much more free of it uh uh I now uh uh uh uh there is a kind of poem that I have never in my life been able to do and and and that really fascinates me a total form with with the uh I is spri  it's just Williams' Spring and All And I see the later Williams is very much uh what I do do uh All the later Williams is thematically composed and and and and and uh uh uh and and has a th  regular musical progression But in Spring and All there there i there is a sequence of  I don't know what is it Something like thirty two poems It's much more than you could ever compose except by your intuition So what uh  uh that's what I'm sort of going toward and yet uh certainly at the beginning of this poem you you won't find an opening yet I'm going to read as far as as as I have typed and and uh because this'll be the first time I've read these in public  this is the first time by the way I've read that H D poem in public and and uh uh so the previous time I was certainly wasn't ready for it I wasn't quite ready this time That  I I can't get  it's one of the few poems that I can't get my distance from I am uh  for me the poem is a distance not a  not an  a a feeling I mean that uh but my feeling is so mixed up with the feeling of the poem is the way I put it I know the distance is there in the poem
