Antin-David_Complete_Seminar_University-Buffalo_3-27-03 A Subject 0.14 462.427 You know gallons and gallons of gasoline in huge tankers that are explosi  that are flying explosives I mean I don't know I mean I I I  you know but they don't talk about that that  you know that  uh you know they say the the food nearly didn't reach the f  uh the the troops let alone the humanitarian aid The food nearly didn't reach them for the next two days So what you have is all these supplies have to go into  you know high high tech wars require high t  uh re require freight But you could've  I mean I could've run a news program In the area of twenty minutes I could've produced an absolutely clear articulate example of what we knew and what we didn't know very clearly And I said Now go to sleep people and wait for something to happen  You know it would've been the end of the program and not enough s  I mean it wouldn't be enough advertisement really I mean but uh uh when I left it on more than fifteen minutes I had to turn it off because I heard this they were recycling the same bullshit Now that's not a glut of information It's a glut of pseudo information mixed with information information but information is a novelty i i It introduces a novelty into the structure the unexpected uh And the unexpected of course was the geurrilla war which opened up o on our flank Although in classical warfare texts they always say Worry about that if you're going to s  have a long  single long line These guys didn't worry about it In fact they were afraid to say that it might've been a misjudgment I notice when the when the newscasters talk they say Well some people might say that it was a misjudgment of the military but we're not sure The  I mean that's literally what they said I mean there's no textbook in mili in in military operations that doesn't refer to the dangers of exposing er ex of exposing a long flank  I mean it's ancient military lore The Chinese knew it  the Ancient Chinese knew it the Indians who played shatranj knew it Don't let yourself get exposed on a flank You can be cut off So I don't know I mean I  in that sense I I think that it takes a good deal of precision and careful thinking to be able to get somewhere And what I do is think Have mind will travel  I'll think as well as I can and I take pleasure in thinking I take pleasure in trying to figure out what's happening in  to to myself to the world and I think that's part of the pleasure of poetry It's the pleasure of the abil  of pleasure of thinking and and not locking yourself in Now it's not the pleasure of reading an Anthony Hecht poem about which I have no no no  I don't have any terrifying feelings that they're terrible but if you want to write Robert Browning uh dramatic monologues and and update them slightly that's what you're going to get It's okay Has dramatic  it has certain dramatic cynical character that you could say there's a little frisson that it produces at the end usually or at somewhere in the middle of it Great alright It's okay I mean it doesn't bother me I I I have  I I I don't  but I don't  not interested in that I mean that's not that's not an artwork from my point of view Or if it is it's a sort of subsidiary artwork The school of Iowa produces something like a Diet Coke   Well it's a very modestly pleasant drink you know Well it makes you  that makes your teeth great because of all the goddamn saccharine   I think we should take a brief break now Coke break  Buy a Coke break Some type of drink that's  Break time So we'll come back in let let's say ten minutes Five minutes after two Coke break go Okay We'll resume for about an hour Am I answering the questions or am I too uh too digressive  I think it's fine  Nobody disagree  uh As Okay it's recording now so I'll stop lying Everybody is not quite back but think so  No no Well people will come back eventually It's your story What was the line in the nursery rhyme Leave them alone and they will come home wagging their tails behind them  Would you like some chewies  Would you like a chewy No thanks  I can't complain But it has a good look of minimal art  I know it's nice It could be there Alright Would you like me to go Go ahead I'm going to stop now We're all just trying to micromanage the same pieces it  Okay Okay um I was thinking about something you said a little earlier that information is novelty And um I was thinking of  and something I was  talking about was how the  how you're talking s  um the thing I think of is fugues How you bring up a theme and you develop the theme and then later um the themes maybe they change a little bit or maybe you move them And I was thinking if you could talk like um  one kind of how how you how you manage that as you work I mean what's what goes on through your head as you do that Is  uh do you think of it in terms of of like managing themes I don't now uh When I was writing in a uh um more procedural poetry uh i I actually  in in the book called Definitions the poems called Definitions Fermenting was constructed to be a fugue uh and it was constructed specifically uh on the structu  it was built entirely on the structure of a fugue There's a there's a wh  set of themes that come up uh one of this was this whole thing called  uh where I took a definition from an insurance book I I I saw it  as I said my lack of understanding was always one of the things that got to me   And uh I had been trying to r  deal  address a loss of a of a dear friend who died very young and this is many years later because I tried it once before and I hadn't been able to do it And uh I was living in in uh in a corner of the Bronx near the Whitestone Bridge since you had a good library It mostly was filled with Catholic uh Catholic philosophical texts which was rather nice because they had the journals of Simon Weil So uh  but anyway I found a  an insurance manual I figured they would know what value is uh and what loss was At least they would know what loss was They might not know what value was So it  I found a phra  I I went to him and I found in the insurance book this Loss is an unintentional decline in or disappearance of a value arising from a contingency  And I'm thinking that's fine but I don't know what a value is so I went to the dictionary and I found out what a value was and it says  and that that comes from the the particular dictionary I was looking at So uh then I had specifically started mediating o  meditating on you know in a way that you would by playing the themes in relation to each other uh You know uh the term fugue is a metaphor but there was something like my instr  interest in what  you know what they called the stretto that is the bringing toget  the tightening of the distances between  uh narrowing the distances between um the mater the the the materials uh through one theme and another you narrow the harmonic distance to play them closer and closer c  uh closer
