Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A Subject 0.192 394.049 FIVE MINOR SENTENCES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PRIMARY AND ONE SECONDARY TYPE ACCORDING TO CLAUSE STRUCTURE THESE ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY IMPORTANT FIVE POINT ONE SEQUENTIAL SENTENCES GENERATED FROM COMPOUND ONES THESE SENTENCES COMMONLY BEGIN WITH CONJUNCTIONS SUCH AS AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE SHIPS MARGINAL SENTENCES GENERATED FROM COMPLEX ONES IN A TWO SEN IN THIS TWO SENTENCE PARAGRAPH FROM PLASMA THE SECOND SENTENCE IS OF THE MARGINAL TYPE THEY BLEW THE WHOLE THING UP AND WERE PRESENTED WITH A FRAGMENT AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE FIVE POINT THREE ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES GENERATED FROM SIMPLE ONES SUCH AS NEW MAYOR NO CONFLICTS N NON ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES WITH NO CLAUSE STRUCTURE SUCH AS YES NO OR REVOLVING DOOR THERE ALSO EXIST FOUR TYPES OF SITUATIONS IN TAGMEMIC ANALYSIS WHICH ALSO CALL WHICH ALSO GENERATE MINOR SENTENCE TYPES NOW WELL THE break down IN THE WORKS i have READ SEEM TO BE FAIRLY ARBITRARY AND IN NEED OF GREATER WORK THESE ARE ADDITIONS TO STATEMENTS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS EXCLAMATIONS AND FINALLY VOCATIVES GREETINGS CALLS TITLES AND MOTTOES SUCH AS THE DODGE BOYS THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO SENTENCES INTEGRATE THE HIGHER ORDER UNITS OF MEANING THE OBVIOUS FIRST STEP PEERS TOWARDS THE PARAGRAPH AND HERE I WANT TO QUOTE VOLOSHINOV ONE LAST TIME IN CERTAIN CRUCIAL RESPECTS PARAGRAPHS ARE ANALOGUES TO EXCHANGES IN DIALOGUE THE PARAGRAPH IS SOMETHING LIKE A VITIATED DIALOGUE WORKED IN THE BODY OF A MONOLOGIC UTTERANCE BEHIND THE DEVICE OF PARTITIONING SPEECH INTO UNITS WHICH ARE TERMED PARAGRAPHS IN THEIR WRITTEN FORM LIE ORIENTATION TOWARD LISTENER OR READER IN CALCULATION OF THE LATTER'S POSSIBLE REACTIONS THE WEAKER THIS ORIENTATION AND CALCULATION ARE THE LESS organiseD AS REGARDS PARAGRAPHS OUR SPEECH WILL BE THIS CLASSIC TYPE OF PARAGRA TH THIS CLASSIC THESE CLASSIC TYPES OF PARAGRAPHS ARE QUESTION AND ANSWER WHERE THE QUESTION'S POSED AND ANSWER GIVEN BY THE SAME AUTHOR SUPPLEMENTATION ANTICIPATION OF POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS THE TYPE CITED IN WELLEK AND WARREN EXPOSITION OF SEEMING DISCREPANCIES OR ILLOGICALITIES IN {one's / one is / one was / one has} OWN ARGUMENT AND SO FORTH VERY OFTEN WE MAKE OUR OWN SPEECH OR PART OF IT THE OBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN SUCH A CASE A SHIFT OCCURS IN THE {speaker's / speaker is / speaker has} ATTENTION FROM THE REFERENT OF HIS SPEECH TO THE SPEECH ITSELF REFLECTION OVER {one's / one is / one was / one has} OWN WORDS BUT EVEN THIS SHIFT IN VERBAL INTENTION IS IN CONDITIONED BY THE ADDRESSEE'S INTEREST IF WE COULD IMAGINE SPEECH THAT ABSOLUTELY IGNORED THE ADDRESSEE AN IMPOSSIBLE KIND OF SPEECH OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE A CASE OF SPEECH WITH ORGANIC PARTITION REDUCED TO THE MINIMUM NEEDLESS TO SAY WE ARE NOT THINKING HERE OF CERTAIN SPECIAL TYPES OF PARTITION SHAPED BY THE PARTICULAR AIMS AND PURPOSES OF SPECIFIC IDEOLOGICAL FIELDS FOR INSTANCE THE STROPHIC PARTITION OF SPEECH AND VERSE OR THE PURELY LOGICAL PARTITION OF SPEECH OF T OF THE TIGHT PREMISED CONCLUSION THESIS ANTITHESIS AND THE LIKE BUT WE ARE OF COURSE THINKING OF EXACTLY SUCH THINGS HERE AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE THING THAT THE PARTITIONING OF PARAGRAPHS THE IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH AS A VITIATED DIALOGUE IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE STRATEGIES YOU SEE IN THE WORK OF DAVID BRONWICH'S ESSAY BONES MY POETRY AND OTHERS' AND DAVID ANTON WHEN HE GAVE A TALK OVER AT EIGHTIETH LANGDON STREET AND ACTUALLY DESCRIBED HIS OWN WORK IN EXACTLY OF VOLOSHINOV'S TERMS AS A VITIATED DIALOGUE ROSSI LANDI AN ITALIAN SEMIOTICIAN FOCUSES ON THAT PROBLEM A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY HE SUGGESTS THAT THE MODEL OF THE ABOVE SENTENCE INTEGRATION IS CLASSICALLY THE SYLLOGISM SUCH AS IN ALL WOMEN WERE ONCE GIRLS AND SOME WOMEN ARE LAWYERS SOME LAWYERS ARE WOMEN LOGICALLY THESE LEAD TO A THIRD SENTENCE OR CONCLUSION A HIGHER LEVEL OF MEANING SOME LAWYERS WERE ONCE GIRLS LITERATURE PROCEEDS BY ITS OPPRESSION MOST OFTEN OF THIS THIRD SENTENCE POSITING INSTEAD CHAINS ON THE ORDER OF THE FIRST TWO FOR EXAMPLE {here's / here is / here has} PLASMA AGAIN HE THOUGHT THEY WERE A FAMILY UNIT THERE WERE SEVEN MEN AND FOUR WOMEN AND THIRTEEN CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE WHICH VOICE WAS HE GOING TO RECORD BUT THIS INTEGRATION THIS ASSUMPTION THAT ALL THREE OF THESE INTERE THESE STATEMENTS ARE INTERRELATED AND IN FACT ONE RIG HIGHER ORDERS OF PRESUMPTION ABOUT IT IS IN FACT JUST A PRESUMPTION IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN PLASMA WATTON PLAYS WITH THE {reader's / reader is / reader has} RECOGNITION OF THAT PRESUMPTIVENESS {that's / that is / that has} WHY WE TALK LANGUAGE BACK IN SOFALA i am WRITING THIS DOWN WALLOWING IN A SOFT LEATHER ARMCHAIR A DEAD DOG LIES IN A GUTTER HIS FEET IN THE AIR THAT THIRD SENTENCE HAS NOT MUCH TO DO WITH PREVIOUS TWO AND THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT S THIS IS WHY WE TALK LANGUAGE IS AGAIN THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU CAN ONLY INTEGRATE WITH THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE BY MAKING THAT WHAT I AM GOING TO CONTINUE CALLING A SYLLOGISTIC LEAP OR A SYLLOGISTIC MOVEMENT ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SENTENCE TWO PARAGRAPHS BEFORE THE SEPARATION OF THE SENTENCES IN PLASMA IS SO LARGE IT HAS TO SUPPRESS THE INTEGRATION OF SENTENCES ALL TOGETHER QUOTE THE BURDEN OF CLASSES IS A TWENTIETH CENTURY CAREER HE CAN BE INCREDIBLY CRUEL EVENTS ARE ADVANCING AT A TERRIFYING RATE ROSSI LANDI ALSO GIVES {us / u. s.} A FINAL MEANS OF LOOKING AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF A SENTENCE IN HIS WORK LINGUISTICS AND ECONOMICS HE ARGUES THE HOMOLOGY THAT LANGUAGE USE ARISES FROM THE NEED TO DIVIDE THE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THE ElabourATION OF LANGUAGE SYSTEMS AND labour PRODUCTION UP TO AND INCLUDING ALL SOCIAL PRODUCTION ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL IN THIS POINT OF VIEW A COMPLETED TOOL IS A SENTENCE A HAMMER FOR EXAMPLE CONSISTS OF A FACE A HANDLE AND A PLANE OR CLAW with out THE PRESENCE OF ALL THREE HAMMERS do not FUNCTION SENTENCES RELATE TO THEIR CLAUSES IN JUST THE SAME WAY WELL X RICHARD STEIN DISAGREED WITH THAT ALL ONLY THE MANUFACTURER OF HAMMERS WOULD HAVE ANY USE FOR DISCONNECTED HANDLES
