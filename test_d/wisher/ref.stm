Wisher-Yolanda_Complete-Recording_8-4-16 A Subject 0.46 455.48 Cross Ludlow past the mailbox on the corner Risque Video Dino's Pizza and the Emerald Laundromat The fruit trucks tucked into Forty Fourth street on the left house eyes shut with boards fringes of children Once we went into a store sunk into the street owned by a Cambodian woman She sold everything from evening gowns to soup Over to Walnut and Forty Fifth where the Muslim cat sells this chicken wrapped in pita draped in cucumber sauce The pregnant woman behind the counter writes our order out in Arabic We grab a juice from the freezer some chips eye the bean and sweet potato pies Back into the hot breath of West Philly sun is setting The sky is smeared squash tangerines in a glaze Three girls and one boy jump double dutch A white man hustles from the video store with a black plastic bag We look for money in the street steal flowers from the church lawn The shit stain from the wino is still on our step Mister Jim is washing a car for cash John is cleaning his rims to Buju Banton Noel is talking sweetly to the big blue eyed woman Linda on her way to the restaurant The sister in the wheelchair buzzes by with her headphones on One night a man was shot and killed on this block right outside our thick wood door But not today Today is one of those days to come home from walking in the world leave the windows open start a pot of black beans Smoke some Alice Coltraine Cut up some fruit toenails Hold on to the moment as if time is taking your blood pressure Lullaby at Seven Months I have this feeling that my heart will break from the knowing of you so every day I will hold myself to the fire of love and sing you the lullabies of my dreams and even as I hold you I will divine and fashion my heart for the letting go imagining space without your scent your newness I will send the ashes of all the ghosts who threatened our feast to the winds that run counter and I have this feeling that the deepest cracks in my heart will be cemented with joy First Poem at Forty Today I'm forty The years have added up Virginia Slims sayings pepper the air I wear my womanhood like a shearling on the subway royal minks in the bathroom of Suburban Station I am here I am still here I have not been broken beyond repair I am purple onion red lemon lead paint on the windowsill  The web between toes I want to write bishop poems about fish for the next forty years and who will stop me Who will stand in my way Certainly not the ghost who visit in my sleep Certainly not some half formed girl of my nightmares Only me I am the grind in the force I am the turning wheel the luminous walk of water along the river of a curb I'm Yvonda's daughter and better and cold for it The grandfather clocks are chanting songs about my second handedness my two headedness my third womb No gurus to pull out my teeth No kites to hang my woes upon I am the fray in the string before it splits I am the break in my own heart This is forty This is forty my love You dear Gone baby girl Gone woman child Gone the old ladies who'd with me laugh about my lazy loins Miss y'all  The Performer You go fishing for strangers You want to write something full of alchemy that'll make people sit up in their chakras and go mm Make somebody remember you for ages when you leave the room Not fight your way through the crowd but mingle and descend like tar residue from the ceiling You want to leave a trace of yourself on the cotton of people You want the band to know your name the mic to know your mist the poem to pull your strings and make you dance Can you make a match strike behind their eyes Can you make the walls wail bring the ailing from their beds Like a brother all in white like a big woman spitting up raps and washboards on the bandstand bosom heaving with a boll weevil song You bring the belt that lashes the back of everyone's soul and when you finish everybody feel weary Everybody go home think about love or make it  My Grandmama's House is the EPA My Grandmama's house is the EPA call this place home and there's hell to pay Shady lane banks steal people's cribs away police departments acting like the KKK Turncoats treat my Prez like a runaway we rock the mask and hoodie like a gamma ray But can't be no union when our black asses ain't okay Shall we wait for the wiz to change the color of the day while witches of doom rain on our hey hey hey I'm just a black girl sipping ninety four du Bellay plotting over a mean double crochet how to make my grandma's house the USA Going to wear my love like combat boots and berets See them doctors can't save you but your grandma may See them doctors can't save you but your grandma may See them doctors can't save you  Dido Mandingo Grew up in the bay of Montigo Child of martyr said he'd rather be my hero reinvent me in the coves of Montenegro Bilingual he altered the way of my lingo His tongue had a style so instinctual untied my vines and bewitched my mango High the road he took to slay all my doubts
