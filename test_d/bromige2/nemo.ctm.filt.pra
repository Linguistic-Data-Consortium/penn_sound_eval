REF:  i thought to go to chicago right away and suddenly inexplicably my will failed me was it that i had gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months that i needed no one else an older woman a second cousin took me in hand but i was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me what ever our bodies were up to meanwhile i kept a close watch on that LADDER activity thinking how now i would be able to satisfy hilda when next we met THE knowledge how ever ACQUIRED is power i must confess my feelings towards hilda were not unmixed at times i would decide to banish her for she deserved nothing else but then i would see that she was already banished and that i would have to think of something else well the first thing i had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches that's another story a story all in itself and one really very much like this so i do not have to tell it here
