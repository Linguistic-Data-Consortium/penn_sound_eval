you A if you have an imaginative memory memory I may be creating a clearer picture of Helena than I actually saw or perhaps even overstating my first impression of her That it means that over the course of my life I've encountered certain faces that unlike the ever millions that pass by form a clear and permanent image in my mind A few such faces blind the people who I only met once others to strangers and then of course still others to my closest friends I can still see Helena's face as though she were sitting right here in front of me questioning me with the look she wore so often I never saw this look nor the essence of her face captured successfully in a photograph so it was her movements and changes that made her remarkable She was it turned out exquisitely dependent on the transient energy of inanimate life whether I knew this the first afternoon  whether I knew the first aft  that first afternoon she would soon inspire me to great imaginary acts of life was unimportant For in the realm of the possible ideas are unstable and the only comfort is finally you believe that they are true Helena's faraway demeanor without is somewhat present even when the plums were under discussion The bling she brought to class were complex enough to send the rest of us into an unusually lengthy if filled silence She finds these poems usually ten to fifteen lines long looked clustered and smeared in their small Xeroxed typewriter face She signed an MPN as though she were a ship H M Bennett She had a peculiar vocabulary and sense of poetic narrative and as she read I thought I could hear each word weave and twist into the lines and stanzas Quote scratched meek spread in sullen ears and windowed thy hands turned merely brittle and to bone We glance in the poem Odin's wovens are the very fits that struck me The hard sounds of the brutal beaks and bones mixed with the mythological illusion sent my mind into a whir When later I looked up Odin comma ravens of in my E S Hamilton I found this The Norse god Odin unlike Zeus is a strange and a sullen figure always aloof On his shoulders perched two ravens Each day they fly through the world to bring back  bringing back the news of men One raven is named Thought and the other Memory The implications of such discoveries made a little wedge in my psyche a tiny aperture through which uncharted thoughts had a new point of entry On this recent threshold sat a memory met up with the barely distinguishable mouths of desire and from then on worked together to perceive this new beauty of created forms The possibility that poems could be much more than inner feelings began to unfold in my mind and I saw the poem as a made thing saw that and constructed no less than the pattern of intricate tapestry As we hold in my vase this snowflake I was stunned with disbelief to look down and see out of one frozen drop the most perfect crystalline form So my new understanding gave me the clarity I needed to write a poem as Robert Duncan wrote so beautifully but of not mine but of a made place that is mine it is so near to the heart  Think I should skip just to the front No okay um  You can tell I'm from California that like I just had my first snowflake very recently in my life  This is from the second chapter it's called um Echo Ooh which is the secret of written intelligence In this I'm jumping back into um my past I discovered the duplicitous nature of language quite late in my life from in my family correct English was practically an ethical ideal My mother in law to brother Robert had a fixed idea about words which were either right or wrong correctly used or unforgivably misused Using a strict principle they created elaborate vocabulary contests to try and catch each other in the middle of an unintentional malapropism They spout out obscure words and used cleverly planned conversation topics to showcase these words My mother would trap my brother and then he would return the favor As I watched from the sidelines the two of them turned a large vocabulary into a finely honed tool of intimidation This vocabulary weapon was compounded when my brother Robert obtained a two wrong and said the condensed Oxford English Dictionary through a mail order book club offer It came in a blue cardboard casing with a magnifying glass in a long thin drawer at the top He would sit at our dining room table underneath the wrought iron Mexican chandelier and scan slowly slowly down its pages chuckling to himself  Then he'd get my attention by saying Hey Jenn A response to which would inevitably unleash a question such as Are you a nymphomaniac It was a continuation of a relationship based on his knowledge and my lack of it that had begun on the day I was born five years younger than he I was about nine when I finally caught on to the perils of this information imbalance Robert had decided to tell me that an orgy was a party where little girls play jacks I   and I got into big trouble when I asked my mother if uh my friends and I could have an orgy on the kitchen floor Growing up thinking language was full of booby traps set for the express purpose of revealing my ignorance like a dress that could at any minute fall away One would think it unlikely I would eventually become a poet I suppose I must've become addicted to the unique humiliation and constant insecurity actually going to love the unstable ground of lingual trap doors Or at least I found the method of navigating through them sufficiently fascinating to outweigh the peril In junior high school my friend Katie and I cofounded a Good Word Club of which we were the only members We never clearly defined what quality made a word good beyond our simple gubernatorally preference there how the word sounded was however a huge factor and the word good was accepted into our pantheon and all the ensuing privileges of favored status
