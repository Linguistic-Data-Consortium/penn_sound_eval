Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A Subject 0.042 353.695 X THE PLEASURES OF THE FLASH STILL UNDER CELEBRATED IN OUR CULTURE THEY they have MAPPED THESE FEARS OF SEDUCTION AND PLEASURE ONTO THE TELEVISION THE GAME BO BOY THE VIRTUAL WORLD WITH ITS CONSTANT GRATIFICATIONS I MEAN {it's / it is / it has} NOT THAT THERE are not ISSUES WITH THESE OF THINGS BUT {there's / there is / there has} A KIND OF SENSE THAT OH YOU KNOW we will we will we will PUT DISTANCE IN THERE AND {there's / there is / there has} A KIND OF MORAL SUPERIORITY IN THIS CRITIQUE THAT SUPPOSES THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DIDACTIC YOU KNOW WE WE SHOULD TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO NOT HAVE PLEASURE WITH MASS CULTURE WHY YOU KNOW THAT {that's / that is / that has} NOT does not GET AT THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IT does not GET AT WHAT IS WHAT IS A PROBLEM HERE SO AND IT TAKES FOR GRANTED THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE {who's / who is / who has} INTELLECTUAL {they are / they were} OUTSIDE THE CULTURE {they are / they were} SUPERIOR TO IT RIGHT ARTISTS ART FOR THEM IS OUTSIDE THE IDEOLOGIES RIGHT RESISTANCE YOU KNOW THE THE RESISTANCE IS OUR JOB YOU KNOW WE ARE THE MORAL CONSCIENCE OF THE CULTURE AND IF YOU CHALLENGE THIS AS I HAVE DONE ON MANY O OCCASIONS AND I I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO PUT FORWARD TO REPLACE RESISTANCE RESISTANCE SAID A CRITIC RECENTLY TO ME WHEN I GAVE A TALK IN NEW YORK RESISTANCE WILL DIE HARD AND HE NARROWED HIS EYES AS HE SAID IT AND HE HUNCHED UP HIS SHOULDERS IN A KIND OF DEFENSIVE WAY AND THEY WERE VERY WELL FED AND VERY WELL PADDED SHOULDERS IN A BUTTER SOFT LAMB LEATHER COAT AND I THOUGH YES RESISTANCE WILL DIE HARD ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE WITH CAREER INVESTMENTS IN ITS STOCK SO AS I WAS WRITING THIS PIECE ALONG CAME A PRESS RELEASE FROM JOY GARNETT AND IT CAME THROUGH THE e. mail AND IT B IT HAD IN IT THIS BRAND NEW PAINTING THAT SHE SENT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SO WET IT EVEN LOOKED WET ON THE SCREEN IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF WONDERFUL AND THE PRESS RELEASE SAID JOY GARNETT CONTINUES HER EXPLORATION OF THE MALLEABILITY OF INSTANTLY GLOBALIZED IMAGES SHE SAID SHE CULLS THEM AND SHE ARCHIVES THEM SO THAT THEIR CONTEXT EVAPORATES AND I THOUGHT YES THIS IS SO INTERESTING { she's / she was / she is / she has} LIKE DOING THIS YOU KNOW REMEDIATION PROJECT AND JUST WORKING WITH THESE IMAGES AND IT FELT SO MUCH TO ME LIKE THE IMAGES IN MY BOOK OF OF REAL THINGS OF THINGS A {person's / person is / person has} OBSER OBSERVED OR PHOTOGRAPHS AND {they are / they were} SO STRIKING THAT THEY SORT OF STOP YOUR DAY AND I COULD TELL SHE WAS HAVING THAT SAME EXPERIENCE AND THAT THESE THINGS JUST COME OUT DURING IT STOPS HER AND SHE THINKS WHAT AN AMAZING IMAGE BUT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMAGE SHE HAS TO REMAKE IT SHE HAS TO REPAINT IT SO AGAIN I KNOW THAT EXPERIENCE I SIT DOWN I SIT DOWN WITH IMAGES THAT COME FROM THE CULTURE AND I WANT TO DRAW THEM AGAIN SO WHY IS THAT WHAT IS THAT DOING WHAT IS JOY WHAT IS JOY DOING SHE ABSORBS I ABSORB WE PROCESS WE REMAKE THESE THINGS WE EXPERIENCE THE IMAGES ANEW SO {they are / they were} OUTSIDE ME THIS IS NOT OUTSIDE HER {they are / they were} GRAFTED {they are / they were} SCRAPED FROM THAT SURFACE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY KIND OF THROUGH THAT PHYSICAL ACT OF MAKING YOU YOU INTERPRET SOMETHING AND YOU SOMATICIZE IT IT BECOMES PART OF YOU AND {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF SEEING THROUGH THE HAND AND SEEING THROUGH THE BODY THAT GOES ALONG SO WHERE DOES JOY GARNETT GET HER IDEA OF WHAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DOING I MEAN WHAT DOES SHE THINK { she's / she was / she is / she has} DOING WHAT WHAT IS HER IDEA OF MAKING ART WHAT IS IT TO MAKE YOU KNOW POETRY AND TEXT INTO A BOOK WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CREATE EX AESTHETIC EXPRESSIONS AM I REALLY DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT ANYTHING MORE SELF CONSCIOUS THAN I WAS WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE DIGGING TO CHINA DO I KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT MAKING ART THAN I DO ABOUT MAK ABOUT DIGGING A HOLE i am NOT REALLY SURE I THINK CULTURAL MYTHOLOGY INVENTS ITSELF IN {us / u. s.} ANEW OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN EACH GENERATION BUT let us MAKE A COMPARISON HERE let us let us COMPARE JOY GARNETT WITH DAMIEN HEARST RIGHT I MEAN WHAT MAKES ART DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MADE THINGS HOW DO WE KNOW {we are / we were} LOOKING AT ART AND NOT JUST AT SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW {here's / here is / here has} THE CONSUMERIST ISSUE IT COMES RIGHT TO THE FORE HERE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE HIGH STAKES GAMBLE THIS IS HIGH PRICED ART THIS IS KITSCH VULGAR IMAGERY YOU KNOW THIS IS THE INVESTMENT IN BRANDING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RIGHT WHAT GOD MAMMON IS THIS AN OUTRAGE OR IS IT ACTUALLY THE WORK THAT DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL AND ART IN ORDER TO KEEP ITS STATUS I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND SERIOUS WORK AND I THINK IT TELLS {us / u. s.} A LOT I do not THINK YOU CAN BRACKET IT OUT QUITE THE CONTRARY THIS IS THE HIGH MOST HIGHLY PRIZED WORK BY A CONTEMPORARY ARTIST EVEN IF { he's / he was / he is / he has} THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT IT FROM HIMSELF IN PART THE POINT IS THAT IT TELLS {us / u. s.} SOMETHING TELL {us / u. s.} TO GOD {there's / there is / there has} SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF HOW ART AS A CONCEPT IS CONSTRUCTING ITSELF CULTURALLY HOW ABOUT MURRA CULMNEY ANOTHER AR I LOVE THIS GUY I THINK THIS STUFF IS AMAZING OR IS HE JUST A PRODUCT DESIGNER RIGHT IS THIS ART OR PRODUCT THIS IS CRAZED IMAGERY DEVIANT BUT IT FINDS ITS MARK INTO ALL KINDS OF PRODUCTS {it's / it is / it has} A BIT IS THIS AN OUTRAGE RIGHT IS THIS ART IS THIS IS THIS COMMERCE OR IS IT THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKETING AND PROMOTION IN THE PRODUCTION OF NOT JUST ART BUT THE CATEGORY OR ART AGAIN WHAT IS ART THAT {we are / we were} DOING IT OR PHIL COLLINS THIS IS YOU KNOW FROM THE THE VIDEO INSTALLATION THE WORLD will not LISTEN {it's / it is / it has} A WONDERFUL INSTALLATI {it's / it is / it has} SEDUCTIVE {it's / it is / it has} BEAUTIFUL YOU KNOW PHIL COLLINS IS A SMITHS FAN HE SET UP THIS PROJECT TO GO TO THREE CITIES BOGOTA ISTANBUL AND JAKARTA AND HE GATHERED FANS OF THE SMITHS ALL AGES IN THOSE CITIES HE SET UP KARAOKE PERFORMANCES AND HE FIL FILMED THEM AND THEN HE INSTALLED THEM IN THIS BEAUTIFUL VIDEO INSTALLATION WHERE YOU SEE THE THREE CITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY SIDE BY SIDE GOING THROUGH THE CUTS ON THE SMITHS' ALBUM AND WHAT DO THEY SHOW YOU THESE WONDERFUL FIGURES THEY SHOW IMPOSSIBILITIES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OF EVER BECOMING WHAT YOU ASPIRE TO
