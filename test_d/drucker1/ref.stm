Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A Subject 0.042 353.695 x The pleasures of the flash still under celebrated in our culture They  they've mapped these fears of seduction and pleasure onto the television the Game Bo  Boy the virtual world with its constant gratifications I mean it's not that there aren't issues with these of things but there's a kind of sense that Oh you know we'll we'll we'll put distance in there And there's a kind of moral superiority in this critique that supposes that you know we should be didactic you know we we should teach people how to not have pleasure with mass culture Why You know that that's not  doesn't get at the systemic issues It doesn't get at what is what is a problem here um So and it takes for granted the idea that someone who's intellectual they're outside the culture they're superior to it right Artists  art for them is outside the ideologies right Resistance um you know the the  resistance is our job you know We are the moral conscience of the culture and if you challenge this as I have done on many o occasions and I ha I have uh something I want to put forward to replace  resistance Resistance said a critic recently to me when I gave a talk in New York Resistance will die hard And he narrowed his eyes as he said it and he hunched up his shoulders in a kind of defensive way And they were very well fed and very well padded shoulders in a butter soft lamb leather coat And I though Yes resistance will die hard Especially among those with career investments in its stock So as I was writing this piece along came a press release from Joy Garnett And it came through the email um and it b  it had in it this brand new painting that she sent And I thought It was so wet it even looked wet on the screen It was like you know just sort of wonderful And the press release said Joy Garnett continues her exploration of the malleability of instantly globalized images um She said she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates And I thought Yes this is so interesting She's like doing this um you know remediation project and just working with these images and it felt so much to me like the images in my book um of of real things Of things a person's obser observed or photographs and they're so striking that they sort of stop your day And I could tell she was having that same experience and that these things just come out during it stops her and she thinks What an amazing image But to really understand the image she has to remake it She has to repaint it So again I know that experience I sit down I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again So why is that What is that doing What is Joy what is Joy doing um She absorbs I absorb we process we remake these things we experience the images anew So they're outside me this is not outside her They're grafted they're scraped from that surface You know you really kind of  through that physical act of making you you interpret something and you somaticize it It becomes part of you um And it's a kind of seeing through the hand and seeing through the body that goes along So where does Joy Garnett get her idea of what she's doing I mean what does she think she's doing What what is her idea of making art What is it to make you know poetry and text into a book What does it mean to create ex  aesthetic expressions Am I really doing anything different anything more self conscious than I was when I was sitting there digging to China Do I know anything more about making art than I do about mak  about digging a hole I'm not really sure I think cultural mythology invents itself in us anew over and over again in each generation But let's make a comparison here Let's let's compare Joy Garnett with Damien Hearst right I mean what makes art different from other made things How do we know we're looking at art and not just at something else You know here's the consumerist issue It comes right to the fore here You know this is the high stakes gamble This is high priced art This is kitsch vulgar imagery You know this is the investment in branding For the love of God right What God Mammon Is this an outrage Or is it actually the work that demonstrates the importance of the relationship between capital and art in order to keep its status I think this is an important and serious work and I think it tells us a lot I don't think you can bracket it out Quite the contrary This is the high  most highly prized work by a contemporary artist even if he's the person who bought it from himself in part The point is that it  tells us something Tell us to God There's something very very important about this in terms of how art as a concept is constructing itself culturally How about Murra Culmney Another ar  I love this guy I think this stuff is amazing Or is he just a product designer Right is this art or product This is crazed imagery Deviant But it finds its mark into all kinds of products It's a bit Is this an outrage Right Is this art Is this is this commerce Or is it the demonstration of the importance of marketing and promotion in the production of not just art but the category or art Again what is art that we're doing it Or Phil Collins This is you know from the the video installation The World Won't Listen It's a wonderful installati  it's seductive it's beautiful You know Phil Collins is a Smiths fan He set up this project to go to three cities Bogota Istanbul and um Jakarta And he gathered fans of the Smiths all ages In those cities he set up karaoke performances and he fil filmed them And then he installed them in this beautiful video installation where you see the three cities simultaneously side by side going through the cuts on the Smiths' album And what do they show you these wonderful figures They show impossibilities the impossibility of of ever becoming what you aspire to
