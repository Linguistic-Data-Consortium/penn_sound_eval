Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A Subject 0.205 406.897 BUT BUT BUT SHE I THINK THAT YOU THAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DESIGNEDLY IN A WAY WANTING TO BE THERE WELL WH WH BUT AND AND LAYING CLAIM {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE YOU BEGAN THE EUPHERIES BECAUSE YOU realiseD {it's / it is / it has} SOMETHING YOU LAID ON YOU BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} NOT COMING FROM THIS BUT BUT THAT THAT SO HER GNOMIC WILL BE NOW I KNOW MORE THAN YOU DO YOU LITTLE TWERP AND AND THE AND THE RUNE WILL BE I MEAN AND AND GNOMIC IN EMILY DICKINSON DOES NOT MEAN SHE KNOWS SOMETHING IT MEANS SOMETHING ALSO IT NO THE THE LANGUAGE KNOWS SOMETHING { she's / she was / she is / she has} NOT GOING TO I MEAN THIS IS THE WAY I I do not SHE KNO SHE KNOWS PLENTY BUT {that's / that is / that has} NOT WHAT {we are / we were} ENC ENC ENCOUNTERED {that's / that is / that has} SO STRANGE NOR WHAT SHE ENCOUNTERS she will GO INTO SPEAK FROM SOMETHING SHE KNOWS BUT TO BRING {us / u. s.} CLEARLY TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE AT THE RUNE AND THEN THE AND RUNE IS TO EVOKE RUNIC GNOMIC IS SOME UTTERANCE THAT THAT THAT I IS VERY CLOSE TO ENIGMA AND I IS DIFFERENT FROM S SYMBOL ENI ENIGMA IS SOMETHING THAT can not BE TRANSFERRED INTO METAPHOR SO i am TALKING ABOUT THE METAPHORIC HERE IN GOOD DEGREE WHEN I GO THROUGH THESE THEMES THAT ARE CONSTANTLY OPERATING IN METAPHOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRAWS HER TO HIM IS THAT SHE ALSO EXPERIENCES HIM AS E ENIGMATIC THEY REARRIVE AND AND REFUSE A AS I SAI SO {we are / we were} IN THE PRESENCE OF A NO A A A METAPHOR THAT {can not / cannot} BE LOCATED THAT WE BEGIN TO realise IS METAPHORICAL BECAUSE IT HAS NO LOCATION AND MEANWHILE THERE IS AN ENI AN ABSOLUTELY GNAWING ANNOYING A A A A NECESSITY FOR A LOCATION SOMEWHERE SO PLACE THE UNLOO HAS A LOT AND V IS VERY TELLING HERE THE SEA FOR INSTANCE AND OVER BEYOND THERE IN HORIZON AND BEYOND HORIZON ARE ARE NOT GLOBAL AS THEY ARE IN IN IN IN WHITMAN ALTHOUGH { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOT EXPERIEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} I THINK IN THE EARLY POEM SHE HAS SHE HAS SEVERAL REFERENCES COLUMBUS ENCIRCLING SEA ENCIRCLING THE GLOBE AS SUCH GLOBE IS THERE IN HER MIND BUT NOT NOT WHEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOING OVER THERE NOT WHEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOING TO ANOTHER LAND OR ANOTHER PLACE WELL THIS ONE LITTLE POEM IS NOT ONLY WHAT I W WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT IN THE WAY OF THOUGH OF HER STRIKING THE GNOMIC AND THE RUNE BOTH GO BY BEING VERY STRIKING AND SHE BEGINS TO HAVE A LANGUAGE WHICH IS D LIKE SPENCER'S ABSOLUTELY J HER SHE HAS A TENSE THAT LOOKS SUBJUNCTIVE YEAH we will FIND THAT AND THEN SHE ALSO WILL WILL STRIKE OUT ON HER OWN FO FOR THE SERPENT'S FIGURE GLID STEALTHILY ALONG NO ACCIDENT AT ALL i have GOT I THINK TWO VERSIONS OF THIS THERE THERE IT IS FEATURED TERMS ARE THEMSELVES TERMS STANDING NOT SYMBOLS STANDING FOR SOMETHING THAT COMES IMMEDIATELY INTO QUESTION ON AND AND AND AND OPENLY INTO QUESTION WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BUT NOW RUNE IS THE ONE THAT EVOKES THIS RUNE EVOKES WH WH WHERE WHERE GNO GNOMIC'S A GNOMIC COVERS IN SOME WAY OR OR {it's / it is / it has} LIKE A HUSK OF SOMETHING THAT YOU {can not / cannot} GET AT RUNE IS TO CALL UP THE THE THE THING IS VIS VISITATION TO ENCOUNT TO CALL UP THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE THING AN AND THAT IS VERY FREQUENT MODE THESE ARE THE MODES IN EMILY DICKINSON YOU FIND PRAYER CERTAINLY IN IN IN THE TERROR AND AND AND I MEAN ALL HER LIFE SHE INHABITED A A REALM IN POETRY THAT NEEDS PRAYER SO we will FIND PRAYER AN AND AN AN AND AND AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT {that's / that is / that has} WHERE SHE IS MYSTIC A CERTAINTY THAT {she had / she would} GOT TO DWELL THERE BUT THIS ONE LITTLE POEM IS E JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THIS KIND FOLLOWING THAT ONE IN NUMBER TEN IS IS JUST ITS OPENING LINES MY WHEEL IS IN THE DARK I can not SEE A SPOKE YET KNOW ITS DRIPPING FEET
