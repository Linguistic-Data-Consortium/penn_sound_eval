Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Pioneer-Works_12-8-15 A Subject 0.091 393.035 AS THE WALLET TREMBLED AND BILLS SLID IN AND OUT OF IT I WANT THAT INFORMATION VERY MUCH TODAY {can not / cannot} HAVE IT AND THIS MAKES ME ANGRY I SHALL USE MY ANGER TO BUILD A BRIDGE LIKE THAT OF AVIGNON ON WHICH PEOPLE MAY DANCE FOR THE FEELING OF DANCING ON A BRIDGE I SHALL SEE I SHALL AT LAST SEE MY COMPLETE FACE REFLECTED NOT IN THE WATER BUT IN THE WARM STONE FLOOR OF MY BRIDGE I SHALL KEEP TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT REPEAT OTHERS' COMMENTS ABOUT ME THANK YOU PORTRAIT THESE ARE BY ANOTHER GUY NAMED JOHN HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE FIRST IN THE CLASS ASHBERY AND I WAS ALWAYS THE LAST YEAH PORTRAIT OR IS IT A POOR TRAIT I AM A PARASITE I LIVED OFF THE WINGS OF OTHERS WRITTEN IN THE SHADOWS CAST BY THE BURNING OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND COMMONS EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE BY J M W TURNER SOME THREE PARTS AT ONE POINT IN THE STORY THE RAIN WAS GREEN AND THE SKY WAS PINK SHOT THROUGH WITH PAINTERLY STREAKS OF MAUVE AND GRAY every one INCLUDING THE SERVANTS AND MAIDS WENT ONTO THE VERANDA AND BEGAN APPLAUDING IT was not YET EVENING EVEN THOSE WHO WERE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE NARRATIVE THOSE LIKE {us / u. s.} WHO HAD NO PLACE IN THE STORY WERE INVITED TO ATTEND THIS MOMENTOUS EVENT ALONG THE RIVERBANKS THE FULSOME REFLECTIONS OF FLOWERS BLOSSOMED IN EVERY IMAGINABLE HUE SOME COLORS FLOATED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SKY LIKE BOATS FERRYING THE DEAD TO THEIR DESTINATION TWISTED MAZES OF SPARKS LED THE WAY IT WAS A CELEBRATION AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF DREAD AND JOY WE WERE LOST WITHIN A SWIRLING STORM OF SERAPHIC COLOR DRIPPING WITH THE REVELATIONS THE SKY HAD FLUNG IN OUR FACES {that's / that is / that has} WHEN IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE PALACE IS ON FIRE BUT NO ONE DARED CROSS THE RIVER AND APPROACH ITS GATES THIS WAS A DIFFERENT STORY ITS NARRATIVE PROMISING THAT THE CONSTRUCTION AND DESTRUCTION OF CIVIL ORDER WOULD OCCUR NATURALLY LIKE THE WEATHER NEAR THE FLAGS FLYING WITHIN IT THIS IS THE STORY NONE OF {us / u. s.} WERE INVITED TO ATTEND UNLESS WE ALREADY HAD TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN ITS CHAPTERS WITH ITS STAINED PAGES RISING TOWARD THE FIERY CEILING THE ARCHITECT HAD TOLD THEM WOULD BE BLUE FOREVER THIS IS THE STORY THAT DID NOT INVITE INTERVENTION TO JUST AS THERE ARE TWO PAINTINGS WITH MANY WITNESSES HUDDLED ON THE FAR SHORE THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO STORIES IN THOSE WHO were not INVITED TO LISTEN TO THEM THIS STORY HAPPENED BEFORE WE MET NO ONE BUT {us / u. s.} REMEMBERS IT NOW TWO SHADOWS STANDING BENEATH THE STONE ARCH A DARK RIVER FLOWING PAST WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE ALONE WITH EACH OTHER SHARING MEMORIES NO ONE ELSE HAS OR PERHAPS THIS IS THE STORY THAT can not BE ADDRESSED THE ONE THAT STARTED WITH AND with out OUR CONSENT THE ONE WE ARE STILL TELLING THE ONE IN WHICH WE BECOME HONORARY CITIZENS OF A CITY NOT YET NAMED INHABITANTS OF A SMALL CITY A HOVEL IN THE SKY AS IT IS WE ARE SPOONFULS OF ASHES SCATTERED AMONG THE DAYS' ABOMINATIONS we will NEVER BE SURE HOW OUR VOICES INTERSECTED AMIDST THE PILLARS CONSTANTLY BEING REC ERECTED FOR AND AGAINST PRISMATIC DENSITIES BY WHICH ONE IS SUPPOSED TO SWEAR LIFELONG ALLEGIANCE SUCH ALLIANCES SEEM BASED ON A DIFFERENT ASTROLOGY THAN THE ONE GUIDING {us / u. s.} THROUGH THE NIGHT THERE IS ANOTHER SET OF STARS IN THE SKY AND WE do not KNOW THEIR NAMES OR THEIR PURPOSE THAT IS WHAT IS PULLING {us / u. s.} ACROSS THE BURNING LAKE THIS WAS A DREAM WHICH ONE OF {us / u. s.} LATER TOLD THE OTHER OR DREAMED OF TELLING THE OTHER AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES OF FLYING HAVING DISSOLVED LONG AGO EACH OF {us / u. s.} LAY THERE THINKING I WISH I COULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FUTURE THAT WILL COME TRUE A ROOM EACH OF {us / u. s.} THIS IS THE THIRD SECTION LAST A ROOM EACH OF {us / u. s.} WANTED TO ERECT THE STORY OF SHELTER AGAINST THE WIND THAT UNTETHERED {us / u. s.} FROM EVERYTHING WE TRIED TO HOLD ONTO FROM CONCRETE NODES TO ABSTRACT IDEAS EACH OF {us / u. s.} NEEDED THAT SHA SHADED PLATEAU THE PLACE WHERE SENSUAL ASIDES COULD UNFOLD with out INTERRUPTION ON THE SMALL SHELLS ON WHICH WE PRETENDED TO SLEEP WHEN VAST CONSTELLATIONS OF VILLAINOUS LITHOGRAPHY PROWLED THE LAND LOOKING FOR COMPONENTS TO EVAPORATE INTO BURSTS OF FIERY LAUGHTER WE realiseD THE WORLD WAS POROUS AND THAT WE WERE HANDFULS OF SAND TRICKLING THROUGH ITS OPENINGS INTO THE SEA WAITING BELOW HOW TO HOLD ON TO OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER with out THREATENING THE SEEDLINGS BENEATH THE SKIN IN THE BEGINNING WE TOLD OURSELVES THERE WAS AN EXIT SOMEWHERE FOR {us / u. s.} TO BEGIN MAKING UP WHAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD NEVER WOULD LATER WE TOLD EACH LATER WE TOLD EACH OTHER IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS A WINDOW WITH A VIEW OF PARADISE WE SILENTLY AGREED THAT THE WINDOW does not OPEN BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER THERE BUT THAT THE SHADOWS OF ITS IMPRINT COULD BE SEEN ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SOME DAYS WE SIT FACING THEM TRYING TO DECIPHER THEIR PROMISES BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WE LOOK THE OTHER WAY STILL BELIEVING THAT {there's / there is / there has} SOMETHING ELSE
