Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007 A Subject 0.421 435.828 Arrows and arrows same damn deal Kissing eliminates fusion of agitation and dreams Folded in the days the surprising moments with you Look under pain and find me Of course I still love you I'm glad you asked Put on hunting boots and look at my antlers I'm a deer I'm a deer Alright Ooh I was not thinking of that What is that  oh that's your phone Okay  Okay  I sound like a deer dying Say it with green paint for the comfort and healing of their wounds Written after only eating green foods for a day while under the influence of green nail polish on my middle fingers Not until we're all protected he said Not until we're all unprotected I said The scent of magnets we come to bank ourselves against The tune radiates life without pause Yes that's your insurance agent overhead in first class Cash webs form water sends instinct home A switch inside the queen's body stops producing workers to send out a queen The babysitter of empire wants a raise Write on walls write on courthouse sidewalks write on every single mirror you can find I make holes in Iraqi families every time I pay my taxes All these centuries later the occupation still unwittingly shapes the resistance Eruptions at night we only hear to know Burying dead batteries under the green flag of the desert It's all quite stunning sealed under reactions Everybody needs a lover in wartime Fuck for the dead Fuck and love fucking for the dead After the latest body count fuck and fuck and fuck the prayer fucking Run onto the streets screaming death down Terrible vacancies for either hand Settle into time uh Settle into missing time flat on the grass smoking hash until the butterfly Hyperapathy I'm telling you this only once You're outside your jurisdiction Okay So um In wo   In World War One the um the number of people who died that were civilians in the war we  they estimate it to be ten percent And World War Two civilian deaths was estimated at fifty percent In the Vietnam War civilian deaths was estimated at seventy five percent With our war now in Iraq the estimated civilian deaths are ninety percent and  I just recently heard this um Young man who went AWOL after being in Baghdad for a year in the Marines and um He was talking at the front  at the Quaker's Meeting House in Philadelphia and he just sort of glazed over this little topic about all these men that he met in Germany where he is  where he was stationed who were expatriates and I asked them at the Q and A to tell us more about that and after their tour of duty and they lose it in shopping malls or grocery stores or movie theaters or restaurants that we're inst  and we're not talking about what's going on we're not talking about what we're doing we're not talking about what they've been going through And they go back to Germany and they marry German women and they vow to never come back here again And it's something I think we need to think about I think about it a lot This is by Adonis He's one of the Temouzi poets from Beirut It's just a little poem that I wanted to read It's called The Beginning of Naming We have named every place in the name of a sword And have started to build a moon from chalk forests from severed heads and the stars from a night of cadavers We have created a kingdom of mere things So I just wanted to read one more thing and then I'm finished um This is for my new project that I'm working on We're um  as a collaboration with uh Erica Kauffman I'd  I forgot to print out the maneuvers We have three maneuvers we bring She writes in Brooklyn I write in in Philadelphia at the same time and I'd  we  I'd call her on her cell phone I don't have a cell phone so I'd call her from a pay phone at noon and then we exchange these two words But the maneuvers are not  this is not documentary poetry the maneuvers are not the poem They're just to sort of throw us off a a routine and um So the poems are our own but we do share two words but I meant to bring the maneuvers but anyway I'm just going to read this without them So this is my poem from the beginning of the series It's called Tattoos of America's Most Wanted on My Mind Language is transportation Reverse plummet from these ray pierced clouds Watch for steeples wires and poles when reentering an upright day Believe me levitation needs no believers waiting for that island to float out of view They know we love our eyes the photographers Deposit departed one's key Listening for color gets us a natural swing A tree is not a doorframe It's a fact its own poetry in the mulch the root where original pussy juice where no one wears someone else's skin Trust this frog and mud slick concoction Stress on the slow stress on the quiet Born during the occupation We'll name her Little Smothered Heart Hanging around the streets with their cameras and highballs hoping we've been taking care of our eyes Unless breath too is a privilege art is a right Anger never lost in translation A blast of paperwork precedes a dead soldier returning home When this war is over tenderness will maintain the same distance It's time to grow up they'll tell you when you're a disagreeable character With everything you have ignore them I would rather live in constant disappointment than give my life to cynicism A huge fuck you to old answers and other waterlogged filthy interpretations Love has paced out winners long ago Join not hammer Just pulling and ripping open ducts
