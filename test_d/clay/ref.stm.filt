Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A 0.035 373.768 um A FASCINATING THING AND AND NOW we have BOTH HAD A CHANCE TO READ MORE LITERARY HISTORY SO SO WE KNOW GOING BACK TO BLAKE OF COURSE WHO WAS SUCH AN OUTSIDER AND PRINTED %bcack AND ENGRAVED CREATE HIS OWN ENGRAVING TECHNIQUES HIS OWN BOOKS BUT MOST L LITERARY MOST POETS EXIST WITHIN YOU KNOW MICRO NETWORKS OF PUBLISHERS OR book stores THAT PUBLISH THEIR WORK THAT CIRCULATE TO OTHER POETS AND YOU CAN SORT OF TRACE WHAT THOSE NETWORKS ARE %bcack AND i am NOT SAYING NETWORK IN A CONTEMPORARY BUREAUCRATIC SENSE I MEAN RIGHT YEAH YOU COULD TRACE THOSE CONNECTIONS BY LOOKING AT THE WHERE THE BOOKS F THE FLOW OF THE BOOKS YEAH OH YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND WHO PUBLISHES THEM SO {you are / you were} REALLY RIGHT AT THE centre SO WHILE YOU MIGHT YEAH {that's / that is / that has} ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING YEAH FOUND IT AND I COULD IMAGINE QUITE DIFFICULT BECAUSE DISTRIBUTION IS ALWAYS A A VERY DIFFICULT AND UNREWARDING THING none the less YOU LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE WHAT WAS GOING ON HOW THINGS WORKED WELL YEAH I DID AND I BUT I I WAS ALSO ST I WAS TRAVELING A BIT AND VISITING LIBRARIES AND {that's / that is / that has} HOW I WAS SELLING THE BOOKS THAT WE WERE DISTRIBUTING PEOPLE RARELY BOUGHT ANYTHING FROM A LIST THAT WE WOULD SEND OUT BUT IF I WOULD GO AROUND AND VISIT PEOPLE IN SPECIAL COLLECTIONS LIBRARIES YEAH THEY WOULD INVARIABLY BUY MANY THINGS MAYBE SO {that's / that is / that has} WHEN YOU GOT STARTED WITH THE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH SPECIAL COLLECTIONS AND LIBRARIES AND PLACING BOOKS THAT STARTED IT THE DISTRIBUTION AND THEN BUT THEN I realiseD WHEN I DID THE CAGE BOOK I I KNEW THAT IF I WENT AROUND AND SHOWED IT TO PEOPLE THAT THEY I WOULD BE ABLE TO SELL THIS YOU KNOW AND YEAH SO WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE HAVING THAT END POINT YOU KNOW THAT END USER POINT IN MIND AND {i had / i would} MET A LOT OF PEOPLE BY THEN I DID EARLY IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES I CAME OUT AND ATTENDED THE SOMETHING CALLED RARE BOOK SCHOOL THAT WAS A SUMMER programme AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY %bcack AND THIS WAS FILLED WITH ALL KINDS OF LIBRARIANS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND ELSEWHERE STUDYING ASPECTS OF RARE BOOKS AND THAT WAS VERY USEFUL IN BEGINNING TO MEET PEOPLE SOME OF THEM I STILL KNOW NOW ALL THIS TIME AND THEY WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR CAREER THEN AS WELL YEAH NOW M MAYBE A UNFAIR OR A STEREOTYPE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH R RARE BOOKS FOR SURE BUT FINE PRESS PRINTING APART FROM YOU AND CHARLES ALEXANDER AND A YOU KNOW A FEW OTHERS AND LEAVING ASIDE THE CHEAPER USE OF LETTERPRESS BY X BURNING DECK OR TUUMBA AND OTHERS would not HAVE BEEN INTERESTING CONTEMPORARIES ESPECIALLY NOT RADICAL INNOVATIVE POETRY THEY WOULD PUBLISH %bcack KNOWN WORKS AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE WORKS WERE PRINTED AND SET OR MORE CONVENTIONAL WRITING SO YOU WERE COMBINING VERY RADICAL POETIC CONTENT RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY %bcack VERSUS MORE TRADITIONAL RIGHT WORK YEAH {that's / that is / that has} WHY I WANTED X WAS I MY INTEREST IN THE BOOKS THAT WE WERE DISTRIBUTING WAS LIMITED TO THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE WORK AND AND AND THE CON AND AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CONTENT I did not WANT TO RIGHT X I I I LOVE MOBY DICK X A CHAPTER OF MOBY DICK X FAMOUSLY X GO DOWN ON THAT BUT YEAH THERE YOU GO X PROBABLY BE MORE THAN ONE BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A BEAUTIFUL THING TO BEHOLD AN X {it's / it is / it has} STILL NOT THE SAME AS DOING A JOHN CAGE BOOK OR OR ABSOLUTELY {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT YEAH EXACTLY YEAH OR OR OR OR OR JANE BRAKHAGE BOOK {it's / it is / it has} JUST {it's / it is / it has} A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING RIGHT RIGHT BUT WHAT i am INTERESTED IN DRAWING ON THAT FOR A SECOND IS YOU KNOW THE SYNCRETIC WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME IN POETICS IN YOUR CASE THE SYNCRETISM HAS TO DO WITH COMBINING ASPECTS OF A VERY TRADITIONAL FINE PRESS PRINTING %bcack AND KNOWLEDGE OF OF ANTIQUARIAN BOOKS WITH THIS VERY DIFFERENT CONTENT %bcack THAT YOU THAT YOU PUT INTO THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF {us / u. s.} I MEAN THINK ABOUT THE STUFF TH THAT I WAS PUBLISHING AS AS KIND OF A NONPUBLISHER PUBLISHER BUT STILL I MEAN X YOU KNOW WE TYPED STUFF AND WE XEROXED IT IT WAS FINE YEAH YEAH AND IT HAS A NICE QUALITY TO IT AND i am ALL FOR IT BUT X A LOT MORE PEOPLE DOING THE KIND OF STUFF THAT I WAS DOING WITH DESKTOP AND {it's / it is / it has} FINE THE REST LOT LESS PEOPLE %bcack EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO COULD HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID BECAUSE THEY JUST W would not HAVE KNOWN HOW TO DO IT YEAH YEAH THEY NO IT was not {you are / you were} RIGHT {you are / you were} RIGHT THERE were not THERE were not MANY MODELS REALLY I MEAN PERISHABLE PRESS DID PUBLISHED A LOT OF PEOPLE PAUL BLACKBURN ROBERT DUNCAN ROBERT CREELEY YEAH BUT HE DID IT HE DID IT IN A ONE HE DID IT IN HIS WAY IT WAS A VERY PERFECT WAY HE MADE THE IT IT WAS X VERY MUCH IN THE FINE PRINTING TRADITION AND I THINK THAT WHAT GRANARY DOES DID AND DOES WAS TO PUSH IT FURTHER AND TRY TO FIND A PROPER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL OF THE MATERIALS OF TH THE OBJECT SO THIS BECOMES A KIND OF A CROSSOVER INTO WHAT YOU COULD CALL ART AS BOOKS NOW W AT WHAT POINT DID YOU BEGIN TO SEE YOUR WORK AT GRANARY AS THE PUBLISHER OF {artist's / artist is / artist has} BOOKS BECAUSE WE have not USED THAT TERM UP UNTIL NOW RIGHT X WE TALK ABOUT POETRY FINE PRESS BUT YET WE have not WE have not YEAH YEAH IF {you are / you were} LOOKING AT IT FROM TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THE FIRST THING THAT ONE WOULD SAY ABOUT GRANARY BOOKS %bcack THOUGH NOT THE ONLY THING IS IS THAT YOU DID {artist's / artist is / artist has} BOOKS YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT I I WAS AWARE OF {artist's / artist is / artist has} BOOKS IN MANY OF THE VERSIONS OF WAYS OF DEFINING THAT FROM THE SOCALLED DEMOCRATIC MULTIPLE X AND SAW THE WIT IN OTHERS THE KINDS OF BOOKS you will SEE AT PRINTED MATTER AS WELL AS %bcack POET PAINTER COLlabourATIONS OR
