Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A  0.035 373.768 um A fascinating thing and and now we've both had a chance to read more literary history so so we know going back to Blake of course who was such an outsider and printed Mhm and engraved  create his own engraving techniques his own books but um most l literary  most poets exist within you know micro networks of publishers or bookstores that publish their work that circulate to other poets and you can sort of trace what those networks are Mhm and I'm not saying network in a contemporary  bureaucratic sense I mean Right yeah you could trace those connections by looking at the where the books f  the flow of the books Yeah Oh yeah Absolutely and who publishes them So you're really right at the center So while you might Yeah that's one of the most interesting  yeah found it and I could imagine quite difficult because distribution is always a a very difficult and unrewarding thing Nonetheless you learned a lot about the  what was going on how things worked Well yeah I did and I  but I I was also st  I was traveling a bit and visiting libraries and that's how I was selling the books that we were distributing People rarely bought anything from a list that we would send out but if I would go around and visit people in special collections libraries Yeah they would invariably buy many things maybe So that's when you got started with the um  your relationship with with special collections and libraries and placing books That started it the distribution and then  but then I realized when I did the Cage book I I knew that if I went around and showed it to people that they  I would be able to sell this you know and Yeah so what made it possible um having that end point you know that end user point in mind and I'd met a lot of people by then um I did  early  in the early eighties I came out and attended the  something called rare book school that was a summer program at Columbia University Mhm and this was uh filled with all kinds of librarians from around the country and elsewhere studying aspects of rare books um and that was very useful in beginning to meet people some of them I still know now All this time and they were at the beginning of their career then as well Yeah Now m maybe a  unfair or a stereotype but a lot of people involved with r rare books for sure but fine press printing apart from you and Charles Alexander and a you know a few others and leaving aside the cheaper use of letterpress by x Burning Deck or  Tuumba and others wouldn't have been interesting contemporaries especially not radical uh innovative poetry they would publish Mhm known works and it would be about the way in which those works were printed and set or more conventional writing so you were combining very radical poetic content radical in the sense of unconventional and contemporary Mhm versus more traditional Right work  Yeah that's why I wanted  x was I  my interest in the books that we were distributing was limited to the physical aspects of the work and and and the con  and and nothing wrong with the content I didn't want to Right x I I I love Moby Dick x a chapter of Moby Dick x famously x go down on that but  Yeah there you go   x probably be more than one but one of the people you mentioned It's a it's a beautiful thing to behold an x It's still not the same as doing a John Cage book or or Absolutely That's right Yeah Exactly Yeah or or or or or Jane Brakhage book it's just  it's a different kind of thing Right right But what I'm interested in drawing on that for a second is you know the syncretic uh which is so important to me in poetics In your case the syncretism has to do with combining aspects of a very traditional fine press printing Mhm and knowledge of of uh antiquarian books with this very different content Mhm that you that you put into that because a lot of us  I mean think about  the stuff th that I was publishing as as kind of a nonpublisher publisher but still I mean x you know we typed stuff and we Xeroxed it  It was fine Yeah yeah And it has a nice quality to it and I'm all for it but x a lot more people doing the kind of stuff that I was doing with desktop and It's fine the rest Lot less people Mhm even if they wanted to could have done what you did because they just w wouldn't have known how to do it Yeah Yeah they  no it wasn't  you're right you're right there weren't there weren't many models really I mean uh Perishable Press did  published a lot of uh people Paul Blackburn Robert Duncan Robert Creeley Yeah uh but he did it um  he did it in a one  he did it in his way it was a very perfect way he made the  it it was x very much in the fine printing tradition and I think that what Granary does did and does was to push it further and um try to find a proper relationship between all of the materials of th the object So this becomes a kind of a crossover into what you could call art as books now w  at what point did you begin to see your work at Granary as the publisher of artist's books Because we haven't used that term up until now right x we talk about poetry fine press but yet We haven't we haven't yeah Yeah If you're looking at it from two thousand twenty one the first thing that one would say about Granary Books Mhm though not the only thing is is that you did artist's books Yeah I would say that um I I was aware of artist's books in many of the versions of ways of defining that from the socalled democratic multiple x and um saw the wit in others the kinds of books you'll see at Printed Matter as well as um Mhm poet painter collaborations or
