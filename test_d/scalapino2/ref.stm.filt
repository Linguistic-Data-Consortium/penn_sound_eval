Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A Unknown1 0.16 547.566 TO A MOMENT OR LIKE A MOMENT W WANTING TO LIKE CONTINUE IT JUST A LITTLE LONG LONGER AS A UNIFYING TIME CAPSULE A KIND OF PRESSING THAT KIND OF PRESSING THAT THAT BOB WAS DESCRIBING AS THE PRESSURE OF O'HARA LIKE HE WANTS TO HAVE A MOMENT WHICH IS KIND OF VAGUE WHEN YOU READ IT LIKE ON THE PAGE YEAH BUT YET AS YOU SAID BEFORE IN RELATION TO THE POEMS IT LIKE IT OCCURS QUICKLY AS A PROCESSION BUT AS RECORDED IT SEEMS TO some how WANT TO JUST PUSH THE LIMITS OF WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND YOU ALSO USE THE EXPRESSION RESONANCE AND DURATION I THINK THAT THAT IS SORT OF A KIND OF A OH BOY A CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS MOMENT RIGHT WELL {it's / it is / it has} THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN APPREHEND AN HUGE AMOUNT BUT YOU C BUT IN ORDER TO WRITE THAT TO SAY IT I IS IT C IN THE A AND THE FACT THAT {you are / you were} X U IF {you are / you were} UNABLE TO WRITE THAT WOULD BE {it's / it is / it has} IMPOSSIBLE AND ALSO THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OR YOUR BEING IN THE MOMENT THE MOMENT does not EXIST ANYWAY SO {it's / it is / it has} ATTEMPTING TO TO realise THAT IN OTHER WORDS THAT you have COMPLETELY FABRICATED THIS AND YOUR SENSE OF THE MOMENT IT HAS NEVER EXISTED AND IT is not THERE SO I RELATE THAT TO THAT PREVIOUS QUESTION OF WHETHER {something's / something is / something has} BEING NULLIFIED IN A SENSE THERE IS THAT THAT IT HAS TO BE YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN ONLY EXIST IN THE PRESENT BUT {you are / you were} NEVER IN IT AND THAT IT AND THAT YOU {can not / cannot} AND THAT IT does not EXIST ANYWAY SO YOU do not WANT TO BE LIMITED BY THE BOUNDARIES OF A COHERENCE SO THAT ITSELF IS I WOULD SAY does not EXIST RIGHT WELL {it's / it is / it has} KIND OF AS IF IF YOU HAD THE MOMENT AS A FRAME SO TO SPEAK IF THAT MADE ANY SENSE THAT YOU WOULD THE THE THE WRITING WILL GO PAST IT WILL KIND OF GO PAST THAT BOUNDARY AND IT WILL SHOW YOU THAT {it's / it is / it has} PAST THAT BOUNDARY BY BEING SO BIG OR THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT DEMONSTRATES THAT TENSION OF BEING INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF SOMETHING {it's / it is / it has} IS IT ALSO ILLUSORY BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} AN EXAMPLE OF LIKE WHAT you have BEEN TALKING ABOUT FABRICATING A SENSE OF THE MOMENT OR A CONSTRUCT OF THE MOMENT OUT OF THE PAST OUT OF WHAT YOU REMEMBER IS THAT IS THAT RELEVANT IS THAT RELEVANT TO YOUR I MEAN ONCE YOU GET PAST THE MOMENT {you are / you were} STILL WRITING THAT MOMENT HAS PASSED {you are / you were} IN A SENSE REMEMBERING SOMETHING OR WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN THAT MOMENT WAS TAKING PLACE WHICH STILL IS IS YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} NOT POSSIBLE YES U RIGHT BUT YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE {it's / it is / it has} SIMP IT IS SIMPLY THAT THAT YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE BEHIND TIME EVEN IF {you are / you were} SITTING RIGHT HERE TIME {there's / there is / there has} NO SUCH THING BECAUSE {you are / you were} NOT IF {you are / you were} IN S IN THE SECOND Y {it's / it is / it has} ALREADY BEHIND YOU i am i am INTERESTED IN THIS THIS WHOLE IDEA OF CONSTRUCTING O OF OF CONSTRUCTING SOME KIND O OF OH LINGUISTIC SURFACE OR A POEM OUT OF THE PAST OUT OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} YOU KNOW OUT OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} REMEMBERED IN A SENSE THE IMAGES LIKE YOU KNOW HERE ARE NOT NULLIFIED BECAUSE {they are / they were} STILL {they are / they were} STILL SOMETHING LEFT OVER AND AND THAT IS JUST A SENSE OF OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEEN CONSTRUCTED OUT OF WHAT WHAT HE REMEMBERS i am STRUGGLING WITH IT A LOT BECAUSE i am HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME TRYING TO ARTICULATE WHAT i am THINKING ABOUT AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS A LOT IN TERMS OF MY WORK W IN THE POETRY OF JOHN ASHBERY WHICH I THINK HAS A LOT WHICH THE DISCUSSION TODAY OF O'HARA'S POEM HAS A LOT OF OF RESONANCE WITH I SEE HIM AS ALSO CONSTRUCTING THIS THIS KIND TH THIS YOU KNOW THIS THIS LINGUISTIC WEB AND AND HIS YOU KNOW WR U AND WORKING IN LIKE JUST EXTENDED LONG SENTENCES AND THAT KIND OF THING ESPECIALLY IN THINGS LIKE A S THE SYSTEM BUT {it's / it is / it has} {there's / there is / there has} STILL A SENSE OF U EVEN THOUGH THE SURFACE YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} H {it's / it is / it has} HIGHLY ROTTEN RHETORICAL AND SUPERFICIAL {there's / there is / there has} STILL some how SOMETHING BEING REMEMBERED INTO THE YOU KNOW INTO THE PRESENT OF EXPERIENCING THAT TEXT AND AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT THE I MEAN ANYWAY I MEAN THIS IS WHAT YOU KNOW THAT WHAT I WAS THINKING OF ANYWAY IS IS LIKE THE WORK OF OF ASHBERY ESPECIALLY LIKE IN HIS LONGER MORE YOU KNOW MORE MEDITATIVE KIND OF WORKS I THINK IT WORKS WITH WITH THAT O'HARA YES LET ME SEE I do not KNOW BUT I THINK IN ACTUALLY IN BOTH CASES IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS THIS SENSE OF WALKING DOWN SECOND AVENUE LITERALLY WANTING TO RENDER THAT PRESENT TIME EXPERIENCE YES %bcack AND THE W ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS WITH THIS ENORMOUS BACKLOG OH AND THEN IT BECOMES ABOUT THAT AS WELL YEAH NOT TO BElabour A POINT BUT I THINK WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT DUNCAN'S WHAT IF DUNCAN AND O'HARA CROSSED PATHS IN TERMS OF SENSE OF IMMEDIACY OR SOMETHING I have not BEEN TO BE FAIR I MISSED IT I did not QUITE SAY MUCH {we had / we would} BE TALKING ABOUT HOW DUNCAN'S NOT SPEAKING FOR SOMETHING {that's / that is / that has} BEYOND THE SENSE RIGHT THIS IS THE PRESENT AS WELL OR I MISS SOMETHING THAT LITTLE THING WELL I WAS INTERPRETING THIS AS TRYING TO READ ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT THAT IS OF OH W HE WOULD USE THE VOCABULARY OF SAYING THAT IS I IN THE HEIGHTENED SENSE BECAUSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT BUT IN OTHER WORDS {it's / it is / it has} NOT SOMETHING THAT IS REMOVED FROM ONE THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF SAY OF RELIGION WHICH IS A DOCTRINE WHICH YOU LEARN IN WHICH YOU ARE DISTANCED FROM GOD OR YOU ARE THAT AND YOU HAVE TO realise THAT SO {you are / you were} S SO {you are / you were} SAYING {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} NOT LIKE THE PLATONIC READING IS NOT READING A BIT MORE THAN JUNK MEANING THE EXPERIENCE AS SOMETHING THAT AS A REFLECTION OF SOMETHING OUT THERE RATHER THAN THE IMPORTANT THING ITSELF SAY THAT AGAIN WOW NO THE YEAH I MEAN JUST I WAS i have BEEN THINKING ABOUT DUN OR i am THINKING ABOUT BOTH DUNCAN AND O'HARA IN TERMS OF DAMNED ENEMIES IN POETRY AND BEING VERY DIFFERENT I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS POINT OF INTERSECTION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THE i have DONE READINGS OF DUNCAN IN TERMS OF SORT OF PLATONIC WAY OF THE PART IN EXPERIENCE OR THE MATERIAL OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} ACTUALLY GOING ON IS NOT AS YOU SAID NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT WHAT IT SUGGESTS some timeS IN THE REALM AND THAT SOUL IS SORT OF NOT REALLY WORLD AND i am SO I WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT IF ANYTHING THE IDEA OF HUMAN EX {we are / we were} TALKING EXPERIENCE WELL THAT {it's / it is / it has} CONFUSING BECAUSE ONE does not KNOW WHAT TRANSCENDENT REALM OR what ever i have YEAH OR WHAT IT IS BECAUSE WHAT I THINK { he's / he was / he is / he has} TRYING TO DO IN THE HD BOOK IS TO SAY TO BRING IT BACK TO SOMETHING THAT WHERE THE ONE SELF OR ALL OBJECTS OR ALL BEINGS ARE ARE THE GERM OF WHAT LIFE IS AND THE FANTASY {that's / that is / that has} THE THE ESSENCE OR QUINTESSENCE OF THAT {it's / it is / it has} NOT ABSTRACT {that's / that is / that has} WHAT HE MEANS BY THE ACTUAL o. k. BUT THEN {that's / that is / that has} SO {that's / that is / that has} {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEING READ {that's / that is / that has} {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEING SEEN {it's / it is / it has} THE AND {that's / that is / that has} WHAT HE MEANS BY WORDS LIKE MAGIC OR WRITHE {it's / it is / it has} APPREHENDING THAT ASPECT OF SOMETHING IN THE ACTUAL BEING RATHER THAN REMOVING IT FROM {one's / one is / one was / one has} SELF AS A REFLECTION ON THAT AS IF IT WE AS I MORE RATHER THAN BEING DESCRIPTIVE {it's / it is / it has} EVOCATIVE IN TERMS OF WRITING BUT {that's / that is / that has} THE WHOLE THING I MEAN {it's / it is / it has} AND {it's / it is / it has} VERY DIFFICULT TO TO DESCRIBE THAT NO do not BE A BIG DUNCAN I do not THINK HIS HIS IMPULSE OR IN OR INTENT IS TO IS TO TRANSLATE THAT PARTICULARITIES OF
