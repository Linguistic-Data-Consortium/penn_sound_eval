Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88 A Subject 0.109 473.069 Why we say of an experience or of a practice that it is deep or sinister On the surface he is dealing with the nature of the mystical or the religious But beneath that and almost certainly unintentionally the broader question being asked is why do we adjectivize at all How do we come to say bad of that It is in the context of this that he asks quote But could I not just as well ask when I see someone killed is it simply what I see that makes an impression on me or does this come with the hypothesis that someone is being killed here end quote You can see that I leave him with credit for his double interrogative But I can't help but wonder what it is that makes him experience a difference between what he sees and what he thinks he sees  um Now I'll read uh some newer poems And uh some of these were published in abacus that uh David mentioned that was  that the title of the collection of which was titled Riot Now Some of these I read uh  Recently at Saint Mark's and some of them I didn't uh But again and like Michael because tomorrow's Valentines Day I tried to pull together some that uh had something of that about them And I'm going to read those first and then if time permits perhaps I'll read some of the others that uh have some other things about them I want to touch your little nipples and put my hand between between your legs  I want to hold you from behinds so that your ass feels my cockhead In the afternoon I finally kiss her and in the evening repeatedly kiss her neck I kiss your eyes and all over I c  wouldn't kiss anyone instead In the evening I penetrate her In the morning we almost go to bed Desire affection with an occasion really Desire affection with a location You strung and incredible tent across an abyss There is no connection between a cardinal and the infinite number I want to habituate the filthy pore of this and every other world for no reason I love you The world is moved with your little street tragedies You always make think of licking the back of the neck of the proletariat We'll see if you can get by with half of what you think you need It's lust We'll call it lust Her poignant breasts peer damaged by description A vulva Along the top of the hill the row of shining teepees we'll one by one set light to Emboldened by love so to speak we came away in her hands Her eyes took me with arithmatic accuracy But this is years later in old San Juan in the heat of the night Mary Angelica it is with great pleasure that I introduce you to Reuben and to Miriam I remember Miriam and Reuben like it was yesterday I can see Reuben and Miriam like it was yesterday Only Mrs Duke approves I spend a lot of time thinking about the difference between a zero set and a null set And I come up with you shaded African of the islands This one has a title The title is uh The Idea of Order at Lizard Key There are a lot of people out there who believe in a God without rightly knowing why It must be because of the museums Compare that with some lazy little quiet afternoon bombshell sex in the byways of Queens That's what I was thinking about tonight Lizard Key is a place in a I I forget whether it's a novel or a story by uh J G Ballard Next time I read here I'll read that story To see you in other places with other men's looks on her faces I sent her in other place  in other pieces with other men's licks on your creases You have an urge to live I wouldn't think to interrupt No one comes alone to my house Comme je t'aime je t'aime beaucoup Je temps je temps et je temps tout It's kind of hard to understand if you don't look at it and especially if you have to rely on my ability to pronounce French words But it's obviously uh Comme je t'aime je t'aime beaucoup and uh how I love you how much I  uh how I love you very much or something like that and then um It's kind of a play on words between t'aime T apostrophe A I M E meaning you that I love or whatever and je temps or time or uh sod it's kind of uh  how I love you I love you very much I time I time and I time too An hour of this is worth a hundred days The weather the way it is and thoughts of you the way you are are enough Your neck is beautiful The glazed eyes of the happy municipal people turn me on onto you The long blonde alleys I'll always feel this way about you Worry your little head about me Dusty Or if I douche my head where the stars were but that isn't you Then time when every ounce of my body weighs as much as every other ounce of my body It's then I think most of you  A series of Valentine's poems wouldn't be complete without some mention of this lustrous society that we live in This is called Capitalism in Form The fruits and vegetables are poorer alongside the poorer avenues to the east But that's okay There's more cheap beer The dirt in the glass looks inharmonious and bleak See what I mean about the adjectives To anyone who can or cannot see If it has not been the program then it has always been the effect of the writing of the Quran Bible Torah and their near accomplices to limit human nature and to do so absolutely It has similarly been the effect of secular Are there any literatures to repress human nature And to have done so by instilling examples of thought and action always somehow so much less than what we might achieve By appearing to be external to us literature has been a fabric of pegs against which we jolt of artificial limits In the post prehistoric period in other words at the beginning of the historic there may have been a writing of content and event of actions  Nature is the emblem we would pick from that The civilization of the languages was primarily a process of the opening up of them to the loads of the concepts of time The culminated in the myths of romantic disillusionment a period which is just now flapping its flatulent last Industry was its latest large motif the writing and arts which are now starting lapping the romantic as it were reflect the beginning of the new age to which everything will be absent in which pretense will be the genre of everything including desires Again space will be the first to empty time right behind  We're talking about two three lifetimes
