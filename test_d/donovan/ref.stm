Donovan-Thom_Conrad_Complete-Reading_Zebulon-Cafe_Brooklyn_2-8-11 A Subject 0.953 480.771 What will be left to critique when capital is through with us And what is ironic about those land grabs the poem must preserve a place to remain in what is not real The poem must be an active force in a universe that is heterogeneous however real So that was the whole And now I'm going to read you some notes on my collaboration with C A Conrad and then we will read um the poems that we wrote based on this um somatic exercise called Arthur Echo Somatic exercises are this wonderful form that Conrad has singlehandedly invented and extended through a blog that he keeps called um Somatic Exercises uh Poetry Blog which uh if you haven't seen it it's it's definitely worth reading and um keeping up with  Echo Arthur While housesitting for friends in Philadelphia we collaborated on the following somatic exercise playing Arthur Russell's CD World of Echo on repeat on all five floors of the house We move from floor to floor from nine AM to nine PM taking scheduled breaks for food conversation and checking in for further fine tuning of the somatic maneuvers Basement windows covered pitch black On a little table covered with clothespins and pottery a small boombox plays CD on repeat with bass controls set to maximum A white candle to light when sitting down blow out when leaving The sink beside the table to slowly drip water on one hand while taking notes with the other First floor CD on stereo with balanced equalizer settings All shades open A chair sits by the front door Open mail slot to peer at passing feet on the sidewalk Every other page of notes should be nouns only A page of nouns Second floor CD on small CD on small stereo Volume low computer set to show videos of Arthur Russell and his cello In bathroom the tub is filled with a mixture of water and jasmine flower infusion Jasmine invokes the muses Take notes sitting in a chair by the tub while feet soak in the jasmine infusion Third floor CD on large stereo volume high treble adjusted to maximum books on alchemy sit on the desk by the window Take notes Upper loft CD on third floor stereo carries up to the loft At the end of the bed facing the window which looks over the Philadelphia treetops and skyline There are tarot cards and binoculars on the bed to better see the world Take many notes Last winter I had the pleasure of composing a somatic exercise with my friend C A Conrad Our exercise was based on downtown New York City cellist Arthur Russell's masterpiece World of Echo It is difficult to describe Russell's World of Echo for anyone who hasn't heard it before It has a rare spiritual quality which issues from Russell's songwriting voice and cello playing but also from the production values of the album Perhaps the following passage from Tim Lawrence's biography of Russell Hold Onto Your Dreams makes palpable Russell's subtle accidental studio processes During these sessions it became standard for Arthur to splice together separate tapes and he would regularly grab a track from one tape and fly it into the multitrack of another while his onlooking engineer tried to stay calm Quote We would be mixing on a piece of tape and I would see the splice go by recalls Eric Liljestrand It was all very confusing I could never really tell what we were working on until it was done unquote The ghostly accidents that arose from Arthur's insistence that they rerecord over old tape became became an integral part of the sonic fabric At one point Conrad told me that he used the album to heal a knee injury that he had suffered Russell was trained foremost as a musician and only afterwards as a Buddhist So the healing powers of his music I can only imagine come from the confluence of these two disciplines For our exercise Conrad and I decided to have Russell's album playing on four different stereos throughout the five story house for a twelve hour duration Twelve hours is a long time to do anything and especially to listen to an album triply on repeat Among the constraints I recall imposing on myself many had to do with memory Trying to forget the last line I had written before continuing Interrupting myself mid line then picking up with the line again These exercises in intention and distraction I felt were true to Russell's music So was a certain circularity that the exercises were trying to induce amidst interruption and disjunction We also spent much of the nine hours improvising lines with a set of books I had brought with me from New York City to Philadelphia many of which were of a wholly metaphysical or medical import Among these books included the writings of Henry Corbin and his acolyte Christian Jambet Oliver Sacks's Seeing Voices Maurice Merleau Ponty's selected writings on phenomenology a collection of Gaelic folktales and ballads Hellen Keller's autobiography Robert Koch's Rhubarb and the Tibetan Book of the Dead I also remember reading a number of recently published poetry books including Jules Boykoff's courageous Hegemonic Love Potion Russell perhaps more than any other composer I'd come into contact with understood the importance of tuning his body and his mind as instruments coeval with his cello and the other instruments drum machines guitar tabla he would use throughout his compositions Via studio production Russell gave access to the occult and otherworldly in ways similar to Conrad's use of his own body as a source of information and vision explored through the somatic exercise And to conclude I'd like to read um my contribution to this um little book which um Conrad has a few copies of uh dependent on   book him immediately And um and Conrad will read his um his contribution later Arthur Echo means inhabit ends
