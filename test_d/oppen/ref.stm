Oppen-George_Complete-Recording_SUNY-Buffalo_02-17-67 A Subject 0.187 506.315 And her incredible need which is ours' which is ourselves This is our jubilation exalted and is owed as that truthfulness which illumines speech Like the wind in the trees and the bells of the procession how like the areas of the Earth children in the grass and the wind and the voices of men and women to be carried about the sun forever among the beautiful particulars of the breezes the papers blown about the sidewalks A female will to hide the most evident gawk under a cover surely infinite thing  surely infiniteness is the most evident thing in the world Is it the courage of women to assume every burden of blindness themselves intruders carrying life beyond women carrying a life unaided in their arms in the streets weeping by too much need or too little and life seeming to depend on women burdened and desperate as they are for defying man beyond rescue of the impoverished x whole cities before we can face again the forest and prairies Though the world is the obvious for seeing an unforseeable average one cannot not see which the first eyes saw for us all so each man or woman near his knowledge though it may be of the newest accuity and a mad Jew speak only of conspiracy and people talking and if those paths of the mind cannot break It is not the rock layer but the world even that one dies in Approach the window as if to see the board on which disclosed everything I should have written not the rain of a nineteenth century day but the motes in the air the dust here still What have we argued about What have we done Tightening the air air so thick with myth the words unlucky and good luck float in it to see them no What she smokes an iron mesh links of consequence still at the mind's end relevant You at last will know him nurse Not know him He is an old man patient How could one know him You are the last who will see him or touch him nurse Occurring need of the self not for truth The sad marvels in a least credible circumstance storm of embarkment or the room of a very old man Whitman nineteenth eighteen sixty four The capital grows upon one in time especially as they had got the great figure on top of it now and you can see it very well It is a great bronze figure a genius of liberty I suppose It looks wonderful towards sundown I love to go and look at it The sun when it is nearly down shines on a headpiece and it dazzles and glistens like a big star It looks quite curious Yes that's the end of it It makes some awkwardness as it's difficult to foresee It's hard to read and harder still to listen to more poetry now uh If you want to just mic I'll just sit down and not talk for a while Make a five minute intermission three minute intermission I at least want some intermission Alright  I know you've postponed no short poem cool they put up this this is a good time to read it Very short poem if he goes right in the park and then they wrote so well he seems to be ice skating around the lake He cannot go round that lake forever An open voyage is another matter of his own affair and he notices x And which the poem  short poem's called  I keep warning you now it's short I'll promise them It's called Historic Pun Let the TV that a young man called elated had been the last thing offered in that way A way of behaving a way of being in public which we lacked If there was doubt it was doubt of himself Finding a force in the cafes and bistros force of the familiar and familiars the force of these to gather on the steps the sepulcher great crowds sitting on the steps to watch the sun set on the light I speak of tourists but what we see is there find a word for ourselves or we will have nothing neither faith nor will nor will touched by the dazzle spring touches the beaut shown off Every morning the children appear in the parks Paris is beautiful and ludicrous the leaves of every tree in the city move in the wind The girls have beautiful thighs beautiful skirts all simulate courage Semite to find a way for myself Oh and in connection because that's Paris I wrote a poem which is really about a reviewer Excuse me forgot his name I don't Because that was Paris Henri I've been insulted in Saint Peter's battered in Saint Paul's and hanged in the Place de la Concorde There is one who admires my urbanity There is one in a forest or one in a desert who envies my urbanity It is true and it is remarkable those old walls give shelter This is a bow Astrolabes and lexicons once in the great houses the poor lobstermen met by chance on Swan's Eye Way where he was born we saw the old farm house propped or leaning on its hilltop on that island where the ferry runs A poor lobsterman his teeth were bad He drove us over that island in an old car a well spoken man hardly real as he knew in those rough fields lobster pots and their gear smelling of salt The rocks outlive the classicists the rocks in the lobsterman's huts and the sights of the island the ledges and the rough sea seen from the road in the harbor in the post office Difficult to know what one means to be serious and to know what one means An island has a public quality his wife in the front seat in a soft dress such as poor women wear She triggered that we came I don't know how to say she said Not for anything we did she said Mildly from God she said What I like more than anything is to visit other islands This called Power the Enchanted World is a series of five very short poems Streets in a poor district crowded we mean the rooms Crowded they come to stand in vacant streets Streets vacant of power there for the irrational routes we are concerned with the given That come before the swallowed airs the winds of March black winds the gritty winds mere squalls under rags There was a force we disregarded and which disregarded us I'd wanted friends who'd talked of a public justice Very simple people I forget what we said Now we do most of the killing having found illogic which is controlled
