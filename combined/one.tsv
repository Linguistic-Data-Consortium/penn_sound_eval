But you can't do that, he hasn't even finished his spinach, urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment. But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment succumbed to a strange new hush. Actually, it's quite pleasant here, thought the Sea Hag. If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don't mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over, She scratched, one dug pensively, But Wimpy is such a country bumpkin, always burping like that. Minute at first the thunder soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder, the color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched his balls, It sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country.

But will he know where to find you recognize you when he sees you, Give you the thing he has for you? Hardly anything grows here, Yet the granaries are bursting with meal, the sacks of meal piled to the rafters. The streams run with sweetness, fattening fish. Birds darken the sky. Is it enough that the dish of milk is set out at night, that we think of him sometimes, sometimes and always, with mixed feelings? Well, this is a fairly recent poem of the past few years. Don't know exactly when Called At First I Thought I Wouldn't Say Anything About It (({NSV})) and uh I can't think of anything I was thinking about when I wrote it, so I won't (({NSV})) introduce it except uh I see it has the phrase, The unruly sun, obviously a uh theft from John Dunne. At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it But then I thought keeping quiet about it might appear even ruder At first I thought I had died and gone to heaven But that scapegrace the unruly son informed me otherwise I'm in my heavyset pants, and find this occupation of beekeeper charming thought I have yet to meet my first bee We don't know if I get to keep the hat and veil Too hot, he said, Too hot for everything, he so caring, so mundane to have you onboard Bulgarian choirs everywhere stood up and sang the song of the rent.

I know now that I'm not longer waiting and that the previous part of my life in which I thought I was waiting, and therefore only half alive was not waiting, although it was tinged with expectancy, but living under and into this reply which has suddenly caused everything in my world to take on new meaning It is as though I had picked up the thread which I had merely mislaid and which for a long time seemed lost and all because I am certain now, albeit for no very good reason, that it was this one and no other The sadness that infected us as children and stayed on through adulthood has healed and there can be no other way except this way of health we are taking, silent as it is But it lets us look back on those other seemingly spoiled days and reevaluate them. Actually, they were too well rounded. Each bore its share of happiness and grief and finished its tale just as twilight was descending Those days are now an inseparable part of our story, despite their air of immaturity and tentativeness They have the freshness of early works which may be wrongly discarded later Nor is today really any different We are as childish as ever, it turns out only perhaps a little better at disguising it But we still want what we want when we want it and no power on earth is strong enough to deny it to us But at least we see now that this is how things are and so we have the sense to stop insisting every so often under the guise of some apparently unrelated activity, because we think we shall be better satisfied this way Underneath the discreet behavior the desire is as imperious as ever But after so many postponements, we now realize that a little delay won't hurt and we can relax in the assurance of eventual satisfaction This was the message of that day in the street when you first perceived that conventional happiness would not do for you and decided to opt for the erratic kind despite the dangers that its need for continual growth and expansion exposed it to This started you on your way although it often seemed as though your feet had struck roots into the ground and you were doomed to grow and decay like a tree Nevertheless you were aware of moving, whether it was you who were moving or the landscape moving forward toward you and you could remain patient with the idea of growth as long as the concept of uniqueness that one and no other ((had)) shown like a star in the sky above you. John Ashbery reading a passage from The System, from his book, Three Poems. For the reader of Ashbery's work, one initial obstacle is overcoming the expectation of a literal, sequential understanding. Well uh it seems that uh I= I think people uh bring this uh expectation to uh almost any poetry and are destined to be disappointed since I don't think this uh condition is unique to me by any chance but applies to almost any poetry that I can think of. It's impossible to have a completely expository poem in mind and then sit down and write it and it would be exactly as it was conceived. uh All kinds of strange things happen while one is writing which deflect the uh original intent and uh my own work I guess is just a # an extreme example of letting this happen. To me it seems more truthful since it's a more complete r- reflection of= of of my thought while I'm writing In nineteen seventy eight, composer Elliott Carter wrote an unusual work titled Syringa for mezzo soprano, bass and chamber ensemble. The bass sings a collection of Greek texts on the legend of Orpheus while the mezzo soprano simultaneously sings John Ashbery's poem called Syringa. Myth of Orpheus is that of the legendary singer who brings his beloved Eurydice back from death an allegory about the presumed power of music an poetry to turn time back and stop irretrievable loss. Even before Syringa, Ashbery had long admired Carter. What is it about Carter's music that the poet finds so sympathetic to his work? Well, the fact I guess that it's so ((um)) uh complex and yet so clear at the same time. Why should that be good? Well, because I think it= it uh reflects uh experience much more accurately.	Subject

Two shadows standing beneath the stone arch, a dark river flowing past What does it mean to be alone with each other, sharing memories no one else has Or perhaps this is the story that cannot be addressed, the one that started with and without our consent the one we are still telling, the one in which we become honorary citizens of a city not yet named Inhabitants of a small city, a hovel in the sky As it is, we are spoonfuls of ashes scattered among the days' abominations We'll never be sure how our voices intersected amidst the pillars constantly being rec- # erected for and against prismatic densities by which one is supposed to swear lifelong allegiance Such alliances seem based on a different astrology than the one guiding us through the night There is another set of stars in the sky and we don't know their names or their purpose That is what is pulling us across the burning lake This was a dream which one of us later told the other or dreamed of telling ((the)) other as the difference between these two types of flying having dissolved long ago Each of us lay there thinking, I wish I could say something about the future that will come true A room each of us # this is the third section, last.

All of our lives is a rebus of little wooden animals painted shy terrific colors, magnificent and horrible, close together. The message is learned the way light at the edge of a beach in autumn is learned. The seasons are superimposed. In New York we have winter in August, as they do in Argentina and Australia. spring is leafy and cold, autumn, pale and dry. The # and changes build up forever like birds released into the light of an August sky, falling away forever to define the handful of things we know for sure. Followed by musical evenings. Yes, friends. These clouds pulled along on invisible ropes are, as you have guessed, merely stage machinery. And the funny thing is it knows we know about it and still wants us to go on believing in what it so unskillfully imitates and wants to be loved, not for that, but for itself. The murky atmosphere of a park, tattered foliage, wise, old tree trunks, rainbow tissue paper, ((wadded)) clouds, down near where the perspective intersects the sunset. So we may know we too are somehow impossible, formed of so many different things. Too many to make sense to anybody. We straggle on as quotients, hard to combine ingredients, and what continues does so with our participation and consent. Try milk of tears but it is not the same. The dandelions will have to know why. And your comic dirge routine will be lost on the unfolding sheaves of the wind, a lucky one. Though it will carry you too far to some manageable, cold, open shore of sorrows you expected to reach then leave behind. Thus friend, this distilled, dispersed musk of moving around. The product of leaf after transparent leaf, of too many comings and goings, visitors at all hours. Each night is trifoliate, strange to the touch. This one, again, appropriate to the weather {cough}. It's called wet casements. Prefaced by a uh # the first sentence of Kafka's story, wedding preparations in the country. Which is when Edward Raban, coming along the passage, walked into the open doorway, he saw that it was raining. It was not raining much. The conception is interesting to see as though reflected in streaming window panes, the look of others through their own eyes. A digest of their correct impressions of their self analytical attitudes overlaid by your ghostly, transparent face. you in falbalas of some distant, but not too distant, era. The cosmetics, the shoes perfectly pointed, drifting. How long you have been drifting. How long I have too for that matter. Like a bottle imp toward a surface which can never be approached. Never pierced through into the timeless energy of a present which would have its own opinions on these matters are an epistemological snapshot of the processes that first mentioned your name at some crowded cocktail party long ago. and someone, not the person addressed, overheard it and carried that name around in his wallet for years as the wallet crumbled and bills slid in and out of it. I want that information very much today. Can't have it. And this makes me angry. I shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of Avignon on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge. I shall at last see my complete face reflected not in the water, but in the worn stone floor of my bridge. I shall keep to myself. I shall not repeat others comments about me. Read about two or three more. This one is called Pyrography which uh is uh # refers to the wood burning kit you probably had or I did anyway, when I was a child making pictures on wood with an electric needle. Out here on Cottage Grove it matters. The galloping wind balks at its shadow. The carriages are drawn forward under a sky of fumed oak. This is America calling, the mirroring of state to state, a voice to voice on the wires, The force of colloquial greetings like golden pollen sinking on the afternoon breeze. In service stares the sweet corruption thrives, the page of dusk turns like a creaking revolving stage in Warren, Ohio. If this is the way it is let's leave, they agree. And soon the slow box car journey begins, gradually accelerating until the gyrating fan of suburbs enfolding the darkness of cities are remembered only as a recurring tick. And mid- midway, we meet the disappointed returning ones, without its being able to stop us in the headlong night toward the nothing of the coast. At Bolinas the houses doze and seem to wonder why through the Pacific haze, and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull. Why be hanging on here like kites, circling, slipping on a ramp of air, but always circling? But the variable cloudiness is pouring it on, flooding back to you like the meaning of a joke. The land wasn't immediately appealing. We built it partly over with fake ruins, in the image of ourselves, an arch that terminates in mid keystone, a crumbling stone pier for laundresses, an open air theater, never completed and only partially designed. How are we to inhabit this space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing, as in a stage set or dollhouse, except by staying as we are, in lost profile, facing the stars, with dozens of as yet unrealized projects, and a strict sense of time running out, of evening presenting the tactfully folded over bill? And we fit rather too easily into it, become transparent, almost ghosts. One day the birds and animals in the pasture have absorbed the color, the density of the surroundings, the leaves are alive, and too heavy with life. A long period of adjustment followed. In the cities at the turn of the century they knew about it.	Subject

But it's yours, (()) said it was mine. The woman said, but now I'm finished with it. I came here today to give it to you. Seven. Twelve years ago, my wife's sister went off to live in Taiwan. Her intention was to study Chinese, which she now speaks with breathtaking fluency and to support herself by giving English lessons to native Chinese speakers in Taipei. That was approximately one year before I met my wife who was then a graduate student at Columbia University. One day, my future sister in law was talking to an American friend, a young woman who had also gone to Taipei to study Chinese. The conversation came around to the subject of their families back home, which in turn led to the following exchange. I have a sister who lives in New York, my future sister in law said. So do I, her friend answered. My sister lives on the Upper West side. So does mine. My sister lives on West A Hundred and Ninth Street. Believe it or not, so does mine. My sister lives at three oh nine West A Hundred and Ninth Street. So does mine. My sister lives on the second floor of three oh nine West A Hundred and Ninth Street. The friend took a deep breath and said I know this sounds crazy, but so does mine. It is scarcely possible for two cities to be farther apart than Taipei and New York. They are at opposite ends of the earth, separated by a distance of more than ten thousand miles. And when it is day in one, it is night in the other. As the two young women in Taipei marveled over the astounding connection they had just uncovered, they realized that their two sisters were probably asleep at that moment. On the same floor of the same building in northern Manhattan. Each one was sleeping in her own apartment, unaware of the conversation that was taking place about them on the other side of the world. Although they were neighbors, it turned out that the two sisters in New York did not know each other. When they finally met two years later, neither one of them was living in that building anymore. Siri and I were married then. One evening, on our way to an appointment somewhere, we happened to stop in at a bookstore+ on Broadway to browse for a few minutes. We must have wandered into different aisles. And because I # and because Siri wanted to show me something or because I wanted to show her something. I can't remember. One of us spoke the other's name out loud. A second later a woman came rushing up to us. You're Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt, aren't you? She said. Yes, we said. That's exactly who we are. How did you know that? The woman then explained that her sister and Siri's sister had been students together in Taiwan. The circle had been closed at last. Since that evening in the bookstore ten years ago, this woman has been one of our best and most loyal friends. Eight. Three summers ago, a letter turned up in my mailbox. It came in a white oblong envelope and was addressed to someone whose name was unfamiliar to me. Robert M Morgan of Seattle, Washington. Various post office markings were stamped across the front, Not deliverable, unable to forward, return to writer. Mister Morgan's name had been crossed out with a pen and beside it someone had written not at this address. Drawn in the same blue ink, an arrow pointed to the upper left hand corner of the envelope accompanied by the words return to sender. Assuming that the post office had made a mistake, I checked the upper left hand corner to see who the sender was. There, to my absolute bewilderment, I discovered my own name and my own address. Not only that, but this information was printed on a custom made address label. One of those labels you can order in packs of two hundred from advertisements on matchbook covers. The spelling of my name was correct. The address was my address. And yet the fact was, and still is, that I have never owned or ordered a set of printed address labels in my life. Inside there was a single space, type written letter that began {cough} Dear Robert, in response to your letter dated July fifteen, nineteen eighty nine, I can only say that, like other authors, I often receive letters concerning my work. Then in a bombastic, pretentious style, riddled with quotations from French philosophers and oozing with a tone of conceit and self satisfaction, the letter writer went on to praise Robert for the ideas he had developed about one of my books at a college course on the contemporary novel. It was a contemptible letter, the kind of letter I would never dream of writing to anyone. And yet it was signed with my name. The handwriting did not resemble mine, but that was small comfort. Someone was out there trying to impersonate me. And as far as I know, he still is. One friend suggested that this was an example of mail art. Knowing that the letter could not be delivered to, Robert Morgan, since there was no such person, the author of the letter was actually addressing his remarks to me. But that would imply an unwarranted faith in the ~US Postal Service. And I doubt that someone who would go to the trouble of ordering address labels in my name and then sitting down to write such an arrogant, high flown letter would leave anything to chance. Or would he? Perhaps the smart alecks of this world believe that everything will always go their way. I have scant hope of ever getting to the bottom of this little mystery. The prankster did a good job of covering his tracks and he has not been heard from since. What puzzles me about my own behavior is that I have not thrown away the letter even though it continues to give me chills every time I look at it.	Subject

Bellamy-Dodie_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Canessa-Park_1-17-09	0.16	373.381	Two sets, double deckered on each window. White with a four inch band of pink and white stripes, hideous half inch wide, vertical, pink and white stripes that cycle through my memories over and over. The jabbing ((eek, eek, eek)) of the soundtrack to a migraine commercial or the movie scene where the crazed killer stabs his butcher knife over and over. ((Eek, eek)), pink and white, ((eek)), pink, ((eek, eek)), white, pink. The four of us are on our bed listening to the Doors and smoking grass. Janice's mother walks in the room and John holds the joint on the side of the bed out of sight. Shirley makes a face and signs, what's that smell? Janice signs back incense. Shirley gave a high pitched scream when she was upset. I heard it often, invariably directed at Janice's father or Elka, his Hungarian mother who lived down the street and who tried to rule their lives. Elka's the only reason Janice and Sharon shared a double bed. When the twin beds Shirley had ordered arrived, Elka appeared and told the delivery men to take them back. Sisters sleep together. That's the Hungarian way and there was nothing Shirley could do about it. As soon as Janice could form a sentence, she became the family translator. Nine years old, called in from jump scoping # j- {NSV} # nine years old called in from jump roping to explain the leaky faucet to the plumber, to negotiate with the insurance agent, to tell Elka no while Shirley screamed in the background. Elka was intense. One time I was at her house when the toilet clogged and she rolled up her sleeve and stuck her arm in and unwedged the shit with her hand. She'd been in the States like forty years, but never adapted. Her English was broken. And when she rode in a car, she'd sit in the backseat white knuckling the door handle and saying slower, slower. Outside it was so cold the snot in your nose froze. Elka scolded Janice and Sharon for leaving the house. {foreign} she'd shout. The streets are icy. It was her catchphrase like go ahead, make my day was for Clint Eastwood. {foreign}. She said it so often Sharon and John spray painted it across the garage door. Lying on Janice+ # Janice's bed smoking a joint, one of us randomly shouts {foreign} and the four of us laugh until spittle flies out of our mouths. Yeah. We had no idea if the crystals on John's windshield were real or if we were hallucinating them. John had just started computer school in Chicago. He was all excited about it. Said computers were the wave of the future. That within our lifetimes, cash money was going to be obsolete and all money transactions would be done with computers. They just introduced major credit cards. And whenever you'd use your card, the clerk would have to make sure your card wasn't bad by pulling out a booklet with thousands of bad credit card numbers listed in teeny type. And everybody in line would shuffle impatiently while the clerk looked through the booklet to see if your card was listed there. It took forever. So we scoffed at John's foolishness. But of course John's real foolishness was dropping out of computer school after six months because he would have gotten in on the ground floor and he'd be rich. I wonder what he looks like now. Is he pot bellied, balding, with a chain smoker's cough, sitting in front of his home entertainment center, drinking beer after beer, feeling like a loser? He was so handsome. A hothead and a loudmouth, to be sure. But his affection was uncomplicated. You could count on it. Janice and I both loved him, though we never would have admitted it. That hasn't changed for me. When I love people, I hide it like a cat hides its illness. As if my love were a dirty little secret. I might love you for instance, and you'd never even know it. I didn't think much about the future in those days. I wanted things to stay the way they were forever. To be a college student living away from home, check from my parents arriving at the beginning of each month. I studied hard, aced my courses, got stoned nights and weekends. Nothing could be better than that. My biggest fear for my future was that at some unimaginably distant point, like when I was eighty maybe, I'd turn into a person who no longer took ~LSD. Some horrible old robot, all dried up and old and efficient. What if I woke up into a twenty first century world without magic? I long to look in the mirror and see that nineteen year old self standing behind me, sweaty and musky, long strawberry hair parted down the middle , pupils dilated, fingers ((gnawed)) bloody. I smile at her and say I'm not so bad. I write books. I go to coffee houses. I give readings. She flashes on my sex life and rolls her green, stoned eyes. She can see everything. My sobriety, my reserve. How when I get home, the first thing I do is head for the kitchen and wash my hands as if to shake the world from my fingers. I say I have a pink Chenille bathrobe just like you.  Even though they're near impossible to find in two thousand and nine. I make raw almond milk twice a week. You haven't tripped since nineteen eighty one, she says. Scrunching up her face and jutting out her lower lip like Doris Day about to blow her bangs sky high. Sharon was tall and thin with large eyes and lips.	Subject

A girl sings along without knowing the words and enters your memory. That there's no present of what will happen to her is your expectation. Everyone becomes great in proportion to a singer's spurious expectations. Like so many good mistakes. Parachute on the desert ((blue)) with light. Eleven sheep head to head in a circle, asleep. Enjoyment and substance in real time involve clearings about which pivot opaque zones. Real is a span of visibility in as much as your flesh is not chaotic of a contingency. The real thing substitutes for another who's not representable as he gathers up parachute and delivery. If I stay here and you mean something, the part in common is disjunct from what you mean. Like my hands touching that you're telepathic means nothing. You facts, you can't know which still work in the connections of my experience. A rock in rain, distributing water along texture is my response to experience. Inasmuch as your flesh is an invisible interplay of disjunction needed for identity, flesh is texture. Our meeting occurs near a hill you climb every day to water transplanted iris. Why don't you let others do that? Although I do not wish to separate from him, now, due to faults of compound phenomena being demonstrated, it seems he will disappear from my sight and hearing. The beauty of his song derives from the fact it represents something to someone. Any family that's concentrated in so far as it represents something may be taken for someone. Wherever there's waiting is this transference. The danger is you'll be deceived by the metonymy of my tender feeling, so light and multiple. You go to pick up the child after school. You remain a few moments talking with a teacher beside the loom. Why are you telling her this? Glory, formless substance, circular dawn. Like a child's drawing of stars or snowflakes and lines. Each line connects. So it's the same star falling loop to loop. And each line belongs to each star. My friend, the white rabbit, little mouse, squirrel, impatient, shaking off their clothes. I wanted to write a= a poem for a long time about um the fertile area of the margin. But then when I wrote it, it was called Nest. And um it's in= in five parts. My mother tongue, Chinese, has an immemorial history before me. I was inserted into it. A motive for my language. I learned it naturally, filling it with intentions, and will leave it without intent for other children. My mother and I speak a local language and sometimes our mother tongue as in my dream with its intent. What do you intend in changing the mother tongue of my daughter? Compassion, not being ill. Sleep  in which she resonates depth like a bell. Loving the wind is equivalent to intention as rhetorical surface like writing a diary on her skin. Non comprehension tips ambivalent matter as if there were two of us here. One is (({foreign})). One is mother tongue. Her matter inserted. A motive is always somewhere else. Exiting one language, another without intent translated as heart. I want to tell you what's difficult to admit, that I left home. Change of mother tongue between us activates an immune system, margin where dwelling and travel are not distinct. The artifacts throw themselves toward light without becoming signification. Telling you is not an edge of the light. There's no margin of a shadow to imply interior. In my childhood house was a deep porch covered with vines. Look past our silhouette to silhouettes like shadows of guests arriving in the bright yard. Light in the next room falls on her as she bends to kiss you. Skylight pours down then covers the mud wall like cloth. I observe the lighted feel that seems to hang in space in front of me. Speaking, not filling in. A surface intent is like a cabinet of artifacts. Comparison coexisting with incongruity. My origin is a linguistic surface like a decorated wall. No little houses, at dusk yellow lights coming on physical mute. Its significance is received outside hearing, decorating simply by opening the view. Wherever I look is prior absence, no figure, ruin, escaping an aesthetic. Hammock Electric Fan Ghost don't qualify as guards the comfortable interior. My guest inhabits is a moving base states of dwelling that are undetermined walls, cross hatched like mother tongues. A foreign woman occupies a home that's impersonal like the nest of a parasite. Its value is contentless but photograph in the context of an indigenous population tipping between physical ease and the freedom of animals accumulating risk. When the scene is complex, I turn to the audience and comment out loud, then return to the room and language at hand weakened by whoever didn't hear me. As if I don't recognize the role because my family moved in while I was away as text implicated with outside the wall is waves. So I decorate in new mother tongue. (()).	Subject

The respiratory system when stimulated produces a characteristic sign, the sinus extends itself during stress and collapses. So the a- autopsy finds only a membrane. Touching a wall produces the sound of touch on another wall. Feedback between health and fate unfolds so fast. There's no way one step in the chain can be based on the previous one. An associated smear or aura requires her to be in a body in order to make decisions. Lack of cloud cover causes thermal energy on the desert to return rapidly to the sky at night. Oxygenating molecules makes light, lighting the organs, they turn white. There's a space. You see something at the far edge and your eye going over this space makes a hole like watery mass in a gourd. The feeling of old organs no longer crucial to or inside themselves while remembering people you loved which flowed from the physical about which you made decisions. To make this whole any object brings into being something not in nature, an interior measurement yourself, not yourself. Bursts of growth. When you sleep, her back bleeds a spray of blood on the snow. She sits on her hands physically preventing herself from scratching. The child, her sense of the world being crucial to or inside itself, of memory and specificity like script. These cells grow for years in a Petri dish. The sick immortalized cells don't know to stop growing. Where your eye goes over space to the horizon makes a hole, but where the sky meets the earth, the fragment is not the same as a whole. Desert ferns covered with reflecting hair may insulate the fronds. Radiations of a state thoroughly embodied and dissolving encounter reflections of light. There is an engine. He cannot separate from the loved person to shed the loved body. um So, um this is the first poem I= I wrote um since um I finished the uh ((four year old girl)) manuscript. um It has a more narrative style. uh It's called Susie, Kiki, Annie and it's in three parts. Susie, Kiki, Annie. On its own terms, my project with them developed a gentle momentum. The vulnerability of their situation engendered by an unassuming spirit of play and togetherness. On my way to work I've had several family members standing in a group close together. I asked each one to tell me his or her thoughts and I tried to remember them all. My sister has just fixed the motorcycle of her friend Tom and she's waiting for him. Among them a fox turns to look at me as if in nature, but she's drawn it, it's symbolic. What can someone who looks like my sister encompass on a different level if she were not my sister or if I had no knowledge of the formal relation? A projector in the dark casts a line of light under the door. Energy of the gap between my sister and the strategy that construes her as pure appearance disperses along the web of family interrelations. There's a stringent physical link, but what goes on inside her seems close to freedom. I know as my power of imagination so strong it appears as a deliberate loss of information. One fox, an open structure, empties like a funnel. One fox enters the world. It does not appear to be an image. There's a relationship between them in which she is involved, walking between animals asleep and late light like blood. Uninterested in the alleged realism of the fox, While she sees it as actually behind the scenes. They watch me in suspense. There is a mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding. Lately, I've been interested in failing to make something exciting, equating the act of walking from one tree to another with understanding. I try to speak to her in a way in which she might take me seriously and answer back. The situation is an image of her gathering a toy horse from beside each candle, of my sister on a white horse, of the horse stepping backwards in water. She stands there for a long time and takes out of her pocket one of the toy horses. She tells me about it as if I were also a lover of horses. But I am not, as she well knows. The way in which she shares her happiness as a matter of course gives me a sense of guilt because I do not feel the happiness. All the animals in the story who eventually die consist of tiny lines scratched into reddish ground. The white of an eye is scratched away but the pupil is ink. Many appear sleepy as if they had just wakened up. Squirrel, little cat, fawn. She wears an oily smock and clothes with a rubber daisy on each one. Light glints off her glasses as she waits with an awkwardness that's both conspicuous and nonchalant. She feels their presence in the woods as an a priori model light subject to decline. Her empathy makes it possible to read the story and see it as a picture at the same time. Is this story of defeat and disappointment, uncertainty, interference, malfunction transcended by the present situation of competent employment? She loses track of her thought then resumes after laughing at herself. The horse takes a small jump in the air and her head and shoulders arch back. I see Minnie Mouse instead of a thin girl in a cotton smock. The ambiguity releases energy. No one enters the family unit except through the magnetism of this energy. ((Stolid)) girls scout like an old man, wild girls in a meadow in the afternoon are subject to an evaluation in which cheapness cannot be avoided. She marks time with her hand and the horse curls its neck and head around her.	Subject

Just wanted to ((cover the things that I do and that= that #)) and um they put me in touch with the ((author's)) foundation which opened up a little bit of a Pandora's box, because they brought out so many amazing things when I went to visit I was then # ((in #)) um so I studied weaving and then started working on my own little type studies and um I don't know about you but when I do monotonous work like hammering away on a you know a gridded typewriter space like this, I'm always listening to things so at this point I was listening to a ((l- #)) really amazing interview with um Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein. It's one of the= the very early line break ((and everything was fresh)) but they just # they had this stellar conversation about landscape and page space where Susan Howe equates page space to freedom. ((Salt and sand.)) this is Annie and Joseph had Black Mountain College and this is ((Laura County Livingfield)) one of Annie's students. uh One of the few people to graduate from Black Mountain as I recall And uh she took the weaving course from Annie and from um another teacher there. And uh thankfully got like two hundred pages of extraordinary notes, all hand typed with lots of draft notation and drawings um {lipsmack} and while I was at the Elder's Archive or actually a little bit up there after I digitized her entire file because it was de- deteriorating rather rapidly and maybe of lesser value than some of the other things ((there.)) um So I scanned it and I have it and now I'm just wondering= {laugh} wondering what to do. I'm gonna give a talk, uh in a few days on the archive but like other projects it takes me a long time to sort of get far enough to # that I know what I'm doing with something so I just spent a lot of time learning. um I did trace the type studies from Black Mountain back to the Bauhau. This is a um a weaving uh um {lipsmack} cloth sample book of some of the type designs This is my favorite Bauhaus study, um done by ((Haja Rose)) of uh just zeroes and lines. Isn't it gorgeous? ((Hm.)) ((So it's)) A Million Random Digits. ((See, I totaled them up)) Yeah. Think John Cage used this quite a bit, ((track some of them down)) So those of you who weave or um might weave would know that weaving's all about numbers, so every thread # every intersection of the thread corresponds to at least two numbers um so even though you're looking at a very simple piece of cloth, you could really draw it out numerically in its entirety um So the piece that I did for the the book was simply a transcription # uh a lovely transcription of that page space {lipsmack} I was giving a talk recently and then I did a little homework on etymology of text and textile and they come from the very same (({NSV})) stem, to weave. But I love the text actually has a {NSV} # uh even a more fabric description of style, tissue of literary work, literally that which is woven, web, texture. So nice ((the way it's)) there, ((so #)) there early on, so that's it. Thought we could open it up to questions. ((You gave us)) have plenty of time. um I'm curious about the Dickinson quotes. um I notice from the images that there were ((uh)) it= seem- it seemed to me ((specifically)) that there's a bunch of similar markings but they're slightly different. ((Do)) they correspond to a certain thing ((like)) from the work? Like the= the= the= the= the way that you sewed the fabric in, ((just the pregnant,)) did it like # how does that # how did you figure out what= what= what to put where? Right. um It's uh as faithful a transcription as I could make so what I did was I scanned Dickinson's manuscript books which you= you have here, you have a fantastic Dickinson collection um So it's a two volume book of um the folio work that she did and there are actually a= a ton more uh manu- # ((uh)) her manuscripts that aren't in that edition so that are far more beautiful even the ((strange)) the light fragments. um But I worked with that because it showed the variant system, so all those crosses that you saw embroidered um precede words, and the words correspond to other words preceded by a cross within the poem um So there's this rather intense um system of alternate or um other ways to read poems uh and they're very strange. I mean sometimes they're close like uh {laugh} like further and farther, which aren't really close at all and sometimes they're like um like the lines like 'tis is # 'tis as if our souls absconded suddenly, and the variant is souls, and the variants below the poem are world, selves, and sun ((Oh)) ((Oh)) so either # any of those could happen.

An old story begun as they entered the shade wherein the trees address the pair of wanderers with promises of succor. When first one friend and the other heard the branches whisper as if to himself alone. And suddenly a most powerful odor overcame their senses. And a woman, naked, broad hips and sloping a shoulder stepped out of the thicket and beckoned. Now, both these men, in flight from a band of relatives who presently were pillaging their homesteads, hoped in the remotest hollow of the forest to find sanctuary and an abandoned mill of which they read. Yet the sight of this creature turned them. Where they fell to arguing, which of them first should address himself to her, who stood expectantly by. They decided, finally, the softest spoken should, he who had first heard the trees murmur. His companion making a joke of it, remarking your mother saw to it you were raised up was a due respect for womanhood. No sooner, however, was this agreed upon than he, this pleasant man, began to waver. Wondering whether the other might not be better for the job and even expressing doubt that he himself had any rights in this matter. Perhaps, he chuckled. I'm not really here at all. He was pushed forward, though. But when he approached the lady, she told him she might only yield herself.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	1.73	455.193	I thought to go to Chicago right away and suddenly, inexplicably, my will failed me. Was it that I'd gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months? That I needed no one else? An older woman, a second cousin, took me in hand, but I was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me. Whatever our ((bodies)) were up to. Meanwhile, I kept a close watch on that ladder activity, thinking how now I would be able to satisfy Hilda when next we met. The knowledge, however acquired, is power. I must confess my feelings towards Hilda were not unmixed. At times I would decide to banish her ((for)) she deserved nothing else. But then I would see that she was already banished, and that I would have to think of something else. Well, the first thing I had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches. That's another story. A story all in itself and one, really, very much like this. So I don't have to tell it here. A year had passed and Hilda had grown some four or five inches so that she was now six feet tall. Her wrists, which had been ((long)) with a kind of vulnerability I found very attractive, were now bony as though she'd been hung from a beam. Her face, deprived of its previous bloom, was long and sallow. In short, I thought her ugly. Pitifully so, although when she spoke the voice was the same and I was glad to feel the pain of that survival. Her place was by no means the palace she had caused me to infer she came from. I had to spend the night on a couch in the living room but by now I knew this kind of evasion of the realities of one's circumstance was widespread and I'd even begun to slip into it myself. Next day when her parents were at work, Hilda, who had taken the morning off, sat with me in the kitchen while her boyfriend raced his motorbike up and down the block, looking up at the window from time to time, sneakily. I caught his glance once when I was looking down. How Hilda must have felt. She had returned to a different perspective, and now here I was, the living proof of a will she wouldn't be likely to meet many more times in the corner she had settled for. For it was clear to me now that all was over between us. Listening to her talk I began to despise the person I had been the year before. Still, I had the will to stay, but the will to leave under those circumstances offered more possibilities and so I bowed gracefully to the inevitable. When I got up to go, tears did come to her eyes. That moment I remember still and I recognized immediately a feeling to be stored up against the ease, if not the indifference, of times to come. Many times in the future I was to conjure that farewell when I was filled with despair and often it sufficed to tip the balance so that it could be thought to have caused several destructive rages over the years. But it's all water under the bridge now. Hardly worth the trouble of telling and it's past time already to think that I have told it poorly and to see that, like it or not, there's nothing I can do about that either. Yes, it might have all been otherwise and yet for what it has to say about the human will in one of its manifestations, I wouldn't change one moment of the misery. For an easier way is not necessarily a better. and I believe I can speak not only for myself, but for Hilda, who found out what it was like to meet her match. A man who scorned to take either no or yes for an answer. ((Okay.)) Now th- these are a series of short pieces with a general title of tight corners {cough} Have I been reading about twenty five minutes? Feels like it. What's the time? Yeah I have Okay. I'll= read= I'll read for about ten minutes more. The boy, elbows bent, supports himself with his hands. His body prone so that his face may approach the surface of this small pond from which he drinks. At his back the lane goes on and the sheep go with it. The black dog at their back, possibly a reminder of the artist or one's self. Further on, one wants to say, though in another sense it's higher up, the lane crooks out of the shade and finds an open meadow from where there must be a better view of that squat church tower. But the clouds, the clouds are more surely the point. Such clouds as are no longer to be seen. A rhythm of contraction would pull one in, deeper into itself, before that open space. Meadow and sky is granted one. These are very loosely sequential and uh it's= it's happiest for me if I just uh make up a different way through it each time. So. The pause is only while ((the eye selects)) something to do. While they watch the cat, while they watch (({laugh})) While they watch, the cat stalks up the path to the front door, raises itself by putting its front paws as high as it can reach against the door and then, resting on its left forefoot, it raises its right so that the knocker is moved out until the arc of the paw falls below the arc the knocker makes and thus the knocker falls back against the metal inset in the door and as they watch, the door opens and the cat slips in as a woman's face appears peering into the street. The two men have been walking for a long time, one thinks though perhaps no more than an hour. It's now becoming obvious that he has chosen the less traveled of two highways out of town in the direction he and his friend want to go. His friend was right, and he was wrong. They resolve to take the cutoff they are now approaching, and to walk its length, if no farm truck comes along, until the other highway is reached. The heat is considerable. It is early afternoon. On either hand huge fields of wheat find no wind to stir them. The only food they have is a chocolate bar. The time comes to eat it, and one unslings the pack and they take it out.	Speaker1

But the woman had pulled him so strongly into her front that a button of her dress had dug in his cheek above the bone and that pain took over. But= after= that= but after that, he saw the hand often, looking where it was cut through just like the meat in the butcher's. There was something he wanted to do with it. He picked it up and felt it from outside and then from in as though he wore it on his wrist like his own hands. He still searched for the jagged metals, but now his father had told him where it came from. He treasured particularly those pieces molded like a screw. You save them up, hoping he'd one day have all the pieces and be able to put them together like a jigsaw puzzle and build a shell of his own. Would it be mine? He asked the father, or the governments? His father told him his, if he kept it hidden. So there was that to think about. He could go out looking in the gutters when the sounds came late at night. I want to start with a book with ((poems)). My first book which came out in nineteen sixty five called The Gathering. That's the name of the book. The poem is called we could get a drink. Sunday morning, lying in, complacencies of the newly wed. Out the window the slender, sun silver trees lead me back to Hampstead Heath where I run again Down sparse grass banks by clumps of gorse. Below silver trees I try to tell you but end up we could get a drink on a Sunday, anyway. You laugh, move closer under the covers. Our silver limbs stir in the gloom like cutthroat trout I saw in a lake a hundred miles out of Vancouver hiding their strike in shadow. The mind a fish, shifting fragilely its position when the body's easy, a still pool. Now eddies in a scene from a documentary seen months back. Girl, eyes like yours, girl, slung over a Tommy's shoulder. Mouth open, but nothing said until the commentator, as the camera pans past the black patch I don't watch because my eye hooks on the hatrack hips. Says starved to death, the soldier throws her into a pit. That's a tangle of white. Very slender limbs. Went sliding down the crater's muddy slide. The instant I called there's a bomb fell here last night. Let's look at the crater. Went running over the Heath, laughing, my friends alone running. Down to today when looking at silver birch I say nothing at all but we could get a drink there. Move closer beneath the blanket, while the cutthroat flick under their bank. This next poem is issued as a book called Please, Like Me. It was put out by Black Sparrow Press in Los Angeles this year. Strolling through the town, all the houses quiet at this hour, the street already hot, hold women. The leader of our magazine crew knew how to gain entrance by knowing that door opening before the act the door opening. The woman, with him, his packet already hung on the back of a chair, his shirt coming off, crossed to the window to pull the shade making it night. But in the morning, unknowing, despite the look she gave him, and me, watching mentioned her husband who handled such matters, her hands at the necklace, her throat was naked of. Compliant women, my expression insisted equally, turn me away, and they would. A snapshot one of them took, as I lugged up my arm to knock, faded, falls from my wallet as I count my take from last night, another subscription sold, working late, to think. Great weight brought to bear on a door flies open at your first touch. Your momentum pitches you sickeningly into the vacuum cleaner, parked in the narrow hall, the muscles involved with nothing to parry ache, a nagging sense of something far from being right. A wrench in the very socket of the self. A disarming tenderness, as if, on the instant, I stopped now, knocked here, went in, found rose lamps lit indistinctly for the sun that floods the room. The brakes, the skid begun, surface slick with the summer shower, he jammed. The chevy's tires, nothing to grip on slid the four of us within inches of the poem's abruption. Welcome. And again, welcome. Make yourself to home. Drove nails into the plaster that wouldn't support even a picture, hardly a heavy piece. Chiaroscuro print cut with a knife from a library book because I, against all claims of social conscience, against all readers whose thighs tomorrow would push against the metal crosspiece of the turnstile, wanted it. The blood floods the shaft. Half moon focus in an enormity of sky extends by fractions limits. The blood continuously feeds, skin, sinew, ligaments wherein, a heaviness of pleasure. Posit night, and it is night, a white flashlight conjures a white door. A red calls forth a red. With which your can't come in, she shouts. But that's no use. I want. All right, you son of a bitch, you bluffer. Even though the sentiment itself be but a bluff, I'll call you. But useless again, if the man on the path must tell her what to say. She switches on her porch light and the day goes, that kind of light by which the face that passed, translucent skin, nose freckled at what bridge it had, the eyes prominent enough so light could be seen to pass through the pupil nonetheless left dark, but liquid dark, the bones of the cheek and chin so clean.

Brown-Lee-Ann_Complete-Reading_Tender-Buttons-Press_UPenn_10-21-03	0.244	370.548	My mother was impressed with my articulation and that I could speak at all, much less make poetic conceptualizations about your birthday. In fact, I was obsessing on what would be in the big birthday book. You almost made the day of eccentricity along with (()), but you pass that over for the day of abandon, total freedom. Same sign as Sinead O'Connor, Mary Queen of Scots, Jim Morrison, Flip Wilson, alter ego, Geraldine, whom your grandmother of the same name was purpor- purported to have loved and others of wild nature unable to be contained. You were also born in the year of the horse and as a Sagittarius, you are a double horsey ready to run and  travel free. But I hope you'll stick close by me for a while because I love it. And even though last month, you're supposedly finally figured out we are separate bodies and identities, you were own self from the beginning of focused, discerning light, so calm for a baby. You did cry, though not as often as most we hear and you did not have that collar or colic, but any of the # but are of the undeniably sweet dis- disposition. Anyway, as I was saying, I love you close by me. And when we= we are together in bed, you nursing in the crook of my arm, I can imagine you are still attached to me as you were in the inside and your fine smooth body, exceptionally fat, fair and pure is covered with fine patina of sweat. It is like you are still swimming in me. One time when you were kicking up a storm so strong in Vienna when I was walking one night to catch the tram to meet your father, you kicked such a complex rhythm that I had to stop walking in order to process the polyphony. I noticed these couplets line are growing longer and longer. It's because I have so much to say to you and the headlong rush seems the way to go if I am to attempt to catch up in all the varied strands of thought and experience that have transpired since your birth, making everything richer and more layered. I even had the feeling yesterday that you had always been here, even though you've only been outside a little over half a year. Maybe you were always there in eternity or infinity. You met destiny on the street the other day and I said destiny, meet reality and reality, meet destiny. And Destiny's mother laughed and told her friend how I looked around when she was calling out down Eighth Avenue. Destiny. Destiny. So many little happenings since you were born. And before now that art and life seem even more enmeshed. I think I'll go take a swim with you and your dad now in the ~L shaped pool with you and your bright pink swim diapers given to us unused by Stella. So many lovely hand me downs and new things too.

But I # this is the only thing I saved from this book out of that. And then the whole thing was published in their place, but um this is definitions at three fifteen.

So please, um usually like eleven ninety five, we'll give two for ten bucks or seven each if you want just one. So, um want to say that before I forget {laugh}. Because we have uh # we brought them down from New York when you had to take them home with you and put them on your bedside.

And I= I did a lot of work with that. And then, um of course I was attracted to India's um work with sleep as a sort of transformative state. um And (()) # we both use those in our works.

Or # this is sort of a title of my book # or a mother to be's book of meltdown, anticipation, and scientific renderings of organic and theoretical forms such as the way flowers lie in the bud.

If I think evil is all taken care of with the genetic test I won't notice that I can be incarcerated for an indefinite period of time without a lawyer, secretly flown to another country and tortured? Well, if you travel to a developing country, we do recommend keeping this test result with your passport. But I'm without human rights here in America. I can be picked up today as I leave this building and never be seen again. No way. Yes way. Liberty+ pulls a uh Washington Post news article from her pocket and hands it to Gal.

Well, let's hope that the clinical trials for the human rights mutation drugs are successful ~A ~S ~A ~P. Clinical trials? Yep. The pharmaceutical companies are all over this one. They need to get some new drugs in the pipeline because their top money makers are going generic. Don't worry, the National Institutes of Health scientists are making sure the trials are the creme de la creme of research. Lib has an a ha moment. So, ~U ~S taxpayers are funding this? Right. Terrific. By law, publicly funded clinical trial participants must be given standard of care for whatever is being tested, so for a human rights drug that means they get universal healthcare. Then when the trials are completed we'll use the march in rights of the Bayh-Dole act to get the money to restructure our health system. Bayh-Dole? Is that some sort of welfare scam? Yeah, you could say that. For the drug companies. The government gives our money to researchers to test and patent drugs. Then the pharmaceutical companies license them and make billions of dollars on our dime, but there's a little known clause in the law that says if the public safety is at risk the government can march in and take back the patents. Deepening her voice {NSV} universal healthcare for the public safety. It will be so cool when health is finally a human right. Well, health isn't a right, it's something we do.

DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	0.55	342.938	The ((beats)) were almost always serious too, I remember. That got me into the literary quarterlies and through the (()) writer's workshop and helped me understand my own dark corners and sharp angles and then one day I realized how much of what I was reading and often admiring going on around me in the poetry world was a kind of picking of scabs and flashing the open sores and wounds as badges and credentials and how O'Hara totally sidestepped that contemporary tendency by tone and choice of vocabulary that cut through the hopelessness of so much poetry and replaced it with the joy of writing a poem. What a simple but wonderful revelation, the joy of writing it down. That was what (()) # that was what it suddenly seemed to be about, in a way that made me think of all I had heard the painters of his time were trying to do, get across the action of the creating rather than the product that was so finished it showed no signs of the activity, the energy and spirit of the actual work that went into it. O'Hara's poems were little excursions into the act of writing poems with the kind of mindset that keeps us trying sex with strangers again and again. The hope that this time is going to be great, give us much pleasure, and satisfy a lot of frustration and totally annul the boring, horrible, deadening, killing in fact, effects of living the modern urban existence. I think I rewrote that phrase. But I still couldn't reconcile that achievement with the personal references, though they were becoming more and more familiar and thus less and less elitist, though still somewhat obscure. And one day I was teaching contemporary poetry to a college class and talking about a poem of O'Hara's, I think it was a step away from them. After talking about the poem Steps and how it overcame the sadness of love's ending or going sour amid the big city grind and in discussing how it did this ((mostly)) ((through)) the structure of the poem because by then I'd learned so much about movement and rhythm and construction I could see how well made O'Hara's poems are despite or maybe because of their conversational flow, and in the process of explaining why the poems were good from a strategic and structural point of view because they accomplished this message of hope in the face of contemporary despair and despite well-founded reasons for lamenting our condition or his condition in the specific circumstances of the poem and did it through technical agility so refined the surface ambience of ease and a kind of glib grace was hardly disturbed, suddenly I caught myself starting to cry, and I never cried back then, in fact except for a short interlude of about a year of weepiness I never cried period except over old movies or musicals and it was that heartstring O'Hara had suddenly plucked in me through his poetry that sang so naturally and yet skillfully of overcoming stupidity and tediousness of so much of life. The true romantic, only without the pretentious and really elitist self-conscious and self-satisfied seriousness of the walking ((wounds)) of contemporary poetry because by mocking the tone of the real and original romantics partly through the use of quotation marks and italics, which is a sort of what ((campy)) dialogue often depends on, as others have pointed out it means talking in italics and exclamation points and exclamations. Oh, he was making himself vulnerable to a (()) scalpel unlike the confessional poets and others of his contemporaries. Even the seemingly honest beats who always exposed themselves in ways that demanded applause or appreciation for the courage of the exposure or the extent of self-destruction the exposure caused ((or)) exposed, et cetera. But not O'Hara, his defenses were the shrewdest and toughest of all because they weren't defensive at all but appeared to be all offensive, only the offensive was mounted against his own and others' defensiveness, thus he could be attacked for ((elitism)) when he's in fact he's our most democratic poet since Whitman. bringing that tradition full circle by reversing Whitman's posing as the common man brother to all which reduced everyone to the level of anonymity that Whitman's poems ensured would never really be his fate, so he could afford it. I'm talking about the ((pose)) which perhaps became a reality much the way Ginsberg seems to have which is not the poetry because Whitman's poetry is often wonderful and amazing and very much more the source of much that is associated with O'Hara and the New York school than many of the French writers constantly attributed with having influenced the New York scene. Although O'Hara is also sort of a Baude- # Baudelairean reverse making the most of the worst of Baudelaire's pessimistic predictions about urban existence by preserving the best of perceptions and emotionalisms the city scene can generate, but instead O'Hara elevates everyone to the level and attentive familiarity of stars, throwing in the names of personal friends alongside those of personal heroes and famous and world-renowned producers and creators of the culture that has come to be ours and which he defined before most of us and with the clarity of the lyrics of a Hollywood musical or a Madison Avenue add. Yet with all the subtlety and imaginative exuberance of a great wit and passionate lover. ((What)) an incredibly seductive combination for a poet. ((His)) poems are sexy. The language is often intimate, the images voluptuous and often exotic, the energy seemingly endless to the point usually reassuring and flattering with just enough ((elusive)) connections to make us want to put out the time and energy to make ourselves as attractively intelligent and perceptive and experienced and in the know as the poems assume we are. He refused to accept an audience that was not as good as he was and in that way included us all in the community of friends he admired and addressed and referred to along with the proper names and familiar rhythms of the most ordinary people and things all of which he incorporated into descriptions and narratives that included the proper names ((and)) rhythms of the most extraordinary things the rest of us are only now (()) after the poems were written= written, getting hip to and how well they fit and work and complete the artistry of O'Hara's genius. He helped me realize that the reason I wrote poems was often simply because the rush, the feeling that accompanied the writing of the poem, especially when it seemed to be coming out good, couldn't be duplicated anywhere else. It wasn't a substitute for anything else, going to bed with someone beautiful and tough, or eating a delicious and totally satisfying meal, or outwitting a horribly abusive competitive creep ((in a)) conversation. and it wasn't a grueling act of anguish and pain, getting in touch with all the ((crabbed)) secrets of the psyche and exposing to them to the well-organized and systematic scrutiny of some poetic form or strategy, ((no))	Speaker1

And now I'm going to read you some notes on my collaboration with ~C ~A Conrad, and then we will read um the poems that we wrote based on this um somatic exercise called Arthur Echo. Somatic exercises are this wonderful form that Conrad has singlehandedly invented and extended through a blog that he keeps called um Somatic Exercises uh Poetry Blog which uh if you haven't seen it, it's= it's definitely worth reading and um keeping up with (({lipsmack})) Echo Arthur While housesitting for friends in Philadelphia we collaborated on the following somatic exercise playing Arthur Russell's ~CD World of Echo on repeat on all five floors of the house We move from floor to floor from nine ~AM to nine ~PM taking scheduled breaks for food, conversation and checking in for further fine tuning of the somatic maneuvers Basement windows covered, pitch black On a little table covered with clothespins and pottery, a small boombox plays ~CD on repeat with bass controls set to maximum A white candle to light when sitting down, blow out when leaving The sink beside the table, to slowly drip water on one hand while taking notes with the other First floor ~CD on stereo with balanced equalizer settings All shades open A chair sits by the front door Open mail slot to peer at passing feet on the sidewalk Every other page of notes should be nouns only.

Take notes Upper loft ~CD on third floor stereo, carries up to the loft At the end of the bed facing the window which looks over the Philadelphia treetops and skyline There are tarot cards and binoculars on the bed to better see the world Take many notes Last winter, I had the pleasure of composing a somatic exercise with my friend ~C ~A Conrad Our exercise was based on downtown New York City cellist Arthur Russell's masterpiece, World of Echo. It is difficult to describe Russell's World of Echo for anyone who hasn't heard it before It has a rare spiritual quality, which issues from Russell's songwriting, voice and cello playing, but also from the production values of the album Perhaps the following passage from Tim Lawrence's biography of Russell, Hold Onto Your Dreams makes palpable Russell's subtle, accidental studio processes. During these sessions it became standard for Arthur to splice together separate tapes and he would regularly grab a track from one tape and fly it into the multitrack of another while his onlooking engineer tried to stay calm Quote We would be mixing on a piece of tape and I would see the splice go by, recalls Eric Liljestrand It was all very confusing. I could never really tell what we were working on until it was done, unquote The ghostly accidents that arose from Arthur's insistence that they rerecord over old tape became= became an integral+ part of the sonic fabric At one point, Conrad told me that he used the album to heal a knee injury that he had suffered Russell was trained foremost as a musician and only afterwards as a Buddhist. So the healing powers of his music I can only imagine come from the confluence of these two disciplines. For our exercise, Conrad and I decided to have Russell's album playing on four different stereos throughout the five story house for a twelve hour duration Twelve hours is a long time to do anything, ((and)) especially to listen to an album ((triply)) on repeat. Among the constraints I recall imposing on myself, many had to do with memory. Trying to forget the last line I had written before continuing Interrupting myself mid line, then picking up with the line again These exercises in intention and distraction I felt were true to Russell's music So was a certain circularity that the exercises were trying to induce amidst interruption and disjunction We also spent much of the nine hours improvising lines with a set of books I had brought with me from New York City to Philadelphia many of which were of a wholly metaphysical or medical import Among these books included the writings of Henry Corbin and his acolyte Christian Jambet Oliver Sacks's Seeing Voices, Maurice Merleau Ponty's selected writings on phenomenology a collection of Gaelic folktales and ballads, Hellen Keller's autobiography Robert ((Koch's)) Rhubarb and the Tibetan Book of the Dead I also remember reading a number of recently published poetry books including Jules Boykoff's courageous Hegemonic Love Potion Russell, perhaps more than any other composer I'd come into contact with understood the importance of tuning his body and his mind as instruments coeval with his cello and the other instruments, drum machines, guitar, tabla he would use throughout his compositions. Via studio production Russell gave access to the occult and otherworldly in ways similar to Conrad's use of his own body as a source of information and vision explored through the somatic exercise And to conclude, I'd like to read um my contribution to this um little book which um Conrad has a few copies of ((uh dependent on #)) {lipsmack} ((book him,)) immediately.

They # they've mapped these fears of seduction and pleasure onto the television, the Game Bo- # Boy, the virtual world with its constant gratifications. I mean it's not that there aren't issues with these of things, but there's a kind of sense that, Oh, you know we'll= we'll= we'll put distance in there And there's a kind of moral superiority in this critique that supposes that you know we should be didactic, you know we= we should teach people how to not have pleasure, with mass culture. Why? You know that- that's not # doesn't get at the systemic issues. It doesn't get at what= is= what is ((a)) problem, here. um So and it takes for granted the idea that ((someone who's intellectual,)) they're outside the culture, they're superior to it right?

We are the moral conscience of the culture, and if you challenge this as I have done on many o- occasions, and I= ha- I have uh something I want to put forward to replace {laugh} resistance. Resistance, said a critic recently to me when I gave a talk in New York, Resistance will die hard. And he narrowed his eyes as he said it and he hunched up his shoulders in a kind of defensive way. And they were very well fed and very well padded shoulders in a butter soft lamb leather coat. And I though, Yes, resistance will die hard. Especially among those with career investments in its stock. So as I was writing this piece, along came a press release from Joy Garnett. And it came through the email um and it b- # it had in it this brand new painting that she sent And I thought, It was so wet, it even looked wet on the screen. It was like you know just sort of wonderful. And the press release said, Joy Garnett continues her exploration of the malleability of instantly globalized images um She said she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates. And I thought, Yes, this is so interesting. She's like doing this um you know remediation project and just working with these images and it felt so much to me like the images in my book um of= of real things. Of things ((a)) person's obser- observed or photographs and they're so striking that they sort of stop your day. And I could tell she was having that same experience ((and)) that these things just come out ((during it)) stops her and she thinks, What an amazing image. But to really understand the image, she has to remake it. She has to repaint it So, again I know that experience. I sit down. I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again. So why is that? What is that doing? What= is= Joy= what is Joy doing? um She absorbs, I absorb, we process, we remake these things, we experience the images anew So they're outside me, this is not outside her. They're grafted, they're scraped from that surface. You know you really kind of # through that physical act of making, you= you interpret something and you somaticize it. It becomes part of you. um And it's a kind of seeing through the hand and seeing through the body that goes along So where does Joy Garnett get her idea of what she's doing? I mean, what does she think she's doing? What= what is her idea of making art? What is it to make you know poetry and text into a book? What does it mean to create ex- # aesthetic expressions? Am I really doing anything different, anything more self conscious than I was when I was sitting there, digging to China? Do I know anything more about making art than I do about mak- # about digging a hole? I'm not really sure. I think cultural mythology invents itself in us anew, over and over again in each generation But let's make a comparison, here. Let's= let's compare Joy Garnett with Damien Hearst, right? I mean, what makes art different from other made things? How do we know we're looking at art and not just at something else? You know, here's the consumerist issue. It comes right to the fore, here. You know, this is the high stakes gamble. This is high priced art. This is kitsch, vulgar imagery. You know, this is the investment in branding. For the love of God, right? What God? Mammon? Is this an outrage? Or is it actually the work that demonstrates the importance of the relationship between capital and art, in order to keep its status? I think this is an important and serious work. and I think it tells us a lot. I don't think you can bracket it out. Quite the contrary. This is the high- # most highly prized work by a contemporary artist, even if he's the person who bought it from himself, in part. The point is that it {laugh} tells us something. Tell us ((to God.)) There's something very, very important about this in terms of how art as a concept is constructing itself culturally. How about ((Murra Culmney?)) Another ar- # I love this guy I think this stuff is amazing. Or is he just a product designer? Right, is this art or product? This is crazed imagery. Deviant. But it finds its mark into all kinds of products It's a bit, Is this an outrage? Right? Is this art? Is= this= is this commerce?

The double turn of throws, of throes of faith, ((the)) cross hatches of bluster, the two steep roads, the energy in wind and wing all were ink cut so fast when I hadn't time to register this time except as ripped. What is, is. What's torn is all. We're coming here with pieces of people we lost, their shadows tangled in the long vigil of the page There was no readiness for the call. This it emerged, almost unseen lurking. Films of gray with screams of un trackable isms shadowed under persons, apples, wall under fold, under the scratched ink of palimpsest+ and under those tricky transcode systems, setting numbers to letters then words to those sums. That pyramid of ~A becomes zero. Now read the newborn letter. Is it from a stranger? A stranger universe It will be palpable, yet balancing, who knew how, on something impalpable. This really is a documentary All things, their else and verge, their costs and lots and lines of provenance the ~Ns and ~Ys and ~X ing place, and ~Rs stark in the world in which all that heartbreaking brightness will break again Day by day I say I resist mourning, this mass of mixed hungers and desperate outcomes, and yet ((it)) catches, wrenches, twists and trips me, trips me. I fall into no place remaining Denn Bleiben ist nirgends, what? Simply to be is not in being rooted but be blown away, be riding, riven further out than loss.

This is the newest poem I have written It's= uh it's a poem which I wrestled with for a long time and put away untouched, and then I was asked very recently if I would contribute to a book intended primarily for children And this sent me back to this poem again which is a fairy tale poem Those of you who know me at all know that one of the overwhelming interests of my life is fairy tales and for many years, I tried to turn my favorite horrific fairy tale, which is called the Juniper Tree into verse, I was totally unsuccessful at doing this And I've ended up doing a b- # a= a fairy from an altogether different tradition I'm happy that I have some Japanese friends in the audience tonight because this poem is in fact a poem based on an old Japanese fairy tale which is called Momotaro or the Peach Boy I don't know whether any of you here know it or many of you here know it but it is a poem which always deeply moved me. Once many years ago, I was set to learning Japanese under the auspices of the United States Navy, as a matter of fact, and the only thing I read of all the material that we went through in the process of learning Japanese that ever stayed in my head was this story. I could still hear it going in my head for instance The noise that the peach out of which the little boy comes makes as it turns over and over in the river, donburi, donburi, donburi. I can hear the boy's mother talking to him as she loads him up with kibi dango millet seed cakes, the best kibi dango in all Japan, and I can hear the animals who stopped him, I've forgotten all the military Japanese I ever knew. I can't tell you the word for a battleship or a gun or an ((emplacement)) or anything else but I can t- # probably tell you this story in Japanese though all the rest of it is departed from me. And I'd wanted to work it and rework it, and I've tried= tried to find a form for it. And it finally occurred to me as I under- # with this ((sic-)) # you see it's= a= it's a long # it's only one poem I'm going to read so I have an excuse for a long introduction, right? uh As I thought about the ((uh)) appropriate form for this poem, I decided I would return to a very ancient and honorable form, very flexible and very beautiful doggerel This is a poem which is written in doggerel. I dearly love a rhyme, I'll do anything in the world for a rhyme and I don't much care how fast or how slow I get to it in the line. The interesting thing which happened to this story which originally had a happy ending Peach Boy goes out and he goes to the Onigashima, the island of the devils, and he conquers the king of the demons, devils, whatever you call them, monsters and he comes back home makes his family happy and he lives happily ever after. But as I wrote this poem, I discovered that the ending of it insisted on changing and I couldn't finish it until I changed the ending And this finally turned out then to be a poem not only about what I always thought it was about, which is the impossibility of finding a proper name for everything, anything, this is a poem about naming. But it also turned out to be a poem about heroism, an antiheroic poem And I suppose the reason it became an antiheroic poem is because the language which I learned reading the story of the little Peach Boy, I ended up using on the island of Iwo Jima and too many bad connotations are connected with it. Anyhow, I think all children always know that the so called happy endings of fairy tales are lies. Right? But they understand that we're courteous enough to lie to them and pretend that we think they believe in us when we tell them that everybody lived happily ever after. You'll see nobody lives happily ever after in this. ((It's)) divided into sections which are the parts of the story. The first part of Momotaro or the Peach Boy then is called The Finding of the Peach An old woodchopper and his old, old wife lived in the forest for all of their life, and the name of the chopper was Chopper. And the name of his wife was Wife and the name of the days they lived was Day and the name of the nights was Night But the name of the sum of them all was Pain for they had borne no child to bear their name Until crouched one day by the bank of the stream washing her wash and dreaming her dream, the old woman saw a giant peach afloat on the water just out of her reach Over and over it turned and the sun singing a song or humming a hum, donburi donburi reach out your hand, what is borne in the water may live on the land, what begins as a peach may end as a man, so wet your feet and catch what you can Like a child, she clutched it, clutched at the peach, something to fondle or something to eat like a child she held it tight to her breast but knowing no names how should ((she+)) guess what to call it or what would come next. Peach, she called it carrying it home to where the old man waited alone Part two is called The Cutting of the Peach. I'll cut it, said the old man since cutting was his trade Let's eat what luck has brought us, why should we be afraid? But his wife was lost in wonder and talk, though not her trade was what she did when she was not hanging in a glade their wash or the wash of others or mending what was frayed Hold off, she cried, or let me who've held it to my breast draw the knife across its skin, as soft as a caress	Subject

((in)) the black mirror a woman's trying to erase names. No, she's brushing a boy's hair I should say that um it took me fourteen years to write about the Vietnam experience and at the time I was renovating a house in New Orleans and that pretty much ((prompted)) the moment to write about Vietnam. um I had very systematically written around that experience Well, here's a poem about that's a bit more personal. It's about something I've actually had quite a bit of trouble writing about, which is the death of my father who passed away when I was fourteen and as anyone knows who has lost a parent and certainly lost a parent at a bit of a younger age, there is this # i- in a way, of course it's= it's an incredible tragedy, but there's # there are other things that come with it and I guess as I grew older I felt a strange sense of almost specialness for having sort of survived this thing i- in= in my teenage years and I often ha- have reflected on it as I've grown older that one feels the sadness and the guilt, but another side of the coin is the sense of having been singled out and having been made special by having to go through this experience and I tried to capture that. I don't know if I have, but this poem is called She Thinks of Him on Her Birthday. It's still winter and still I don't know you anymore and you don't know me But this morning I stand in the kitchen with the illusion peeling a clementine Each piece snaps like the nickname for a girl, the tinny bite it was to be one once Again, I count your daughters and find myself in the middle, the waist of the hourglass endlessly passed through and passed through but holding nothing dismayed by the grubby February sun I was born under and the cheap pleasure it gives the window Yet I raise the shade for it, and try not to feel it is wrong to want spring to be a season further from you not wrong to wish for a hard rain, a hard wind, like one we sat out in together, or came in from together. Here's a poem about a situation which i- is ((uh)) probably familiar to many working people, and this one is particularly about working women and the way that we drag ourselves through the day at times. uh Sometimes inspired, sometimes exhausted and I think there is a particular sadness of a woman of a certain age when she begins to realize what she's been doing (({laugh})) with her life and perhaps hoping for something more Works late on a TUesday night again Midtown is blasted out and silent drained of the crowd and its doggy day I trample the scraps of deli lunches some ate outdoors as they stared dumbly or hooted at us career girls, the haggard beauties, the vivid can dos, Open raincoats a flap in the March wind, as we crossed to and fro in front of the public library Never thought you'd be one of them, did you little lady little miss Phi Beta Kappa with your closet full of pleated skirts twenty nine til death do us part Don't you see? The good schoolgirl turns thirty, forty singing the song of time management all day long lugging the briefcase home So at ten ~PM you're standing here with your hand in the air cold but too stubborn to reach into your pocket for a glove cursing the freezing rain as though it were your difficulty It's pathetic and nobody's fault but your own Now the tears, down into the collar Cabs, cabs, but none for hire I haven't had dinner. I'm not half of what I'm meant to be among other things the mother of three Too tired tonight to seduce the father The next poem I'm going to read is a poem entitled The Deck and= um and I think the poem sort of embraces that moment when I realize something that taught me a great deal The Deck I have almost nailed my left thumb to the two by four brace that holds the deck together The Saturday morning in June I've sawed two by sixes ~T squared, ((leathered)) everything, the three bubbles seal in green glass and on the sweat on my tongue taste ((is)) like what I am I know I'm alone, using leverage to swing the long boards into place But at times it seems as if there are two of us, working side by side like old lovers, ((guessing)) each others moves This hammer is the only thing I owned of yours and it makes me feel as if I've carpentered for years Even the crooked nails have gone in straight The handsaw glides through grease. The toenail studs hole. The deck has risen up around me and now it's strong enough to support my weight to not sway with this old silly wrong footed dance I'm about to throw my whole body into Plumbed from sky to ground this morning's work can take nearly anything ((With)) so much uproar, punishment, footwork, and euphoria, I'm almost happy this Saturday. I walk back inside and here you are. ((Planed)) and simple as as the sunlight on the tools outside.

He's just talking {laugh} {laugh} ((Yes.)) This poetry's no different from somebody actually talking for real And the reason I hadn't been able to read him is that my father's poetry and all the poetry I'd ever read was supposed to be somebody talking not for real, or a different style than real conversation ((It's like if he)) reads a sonnet or it's a literary sound or it's= a= it's a pun or on uh somebody else's poem or it has some stale wash of another poem over it. But this was just absolute straightforward uh well uh conversation I guess or declaration or speech. But the poetry was identical with intense fragments of spoken idiom, as you might hear at ((Marseille)) himself. And that was the first time I'd ever heard of such a notion, that the poetry could be real or that realit- # that it could be somebody talking for real, instead of making up a poem like or making up uh # making it up to look good. And I don't know what it was that uh I could- # I don't know how ((uh)) # if I could even you know describe what my idea of poetry was before ((I said I)) was supposed it.

And I began reading ((it and=)) and that really blew my mind then After that, he ((I think was # he read)) let's see uh= uh Pure Products of America Go Crazy and that was very moving Yeah. because I fin- finally understood ((that it was nifty. I thought that I could put the accent in this other style)) ((and we degraded per his destiny about how hunger can feed itself)) And then the interesting thing was when he had to make an imagination of Heaven or what he desired, it was a real down to earth # ((it's)) a very common, while he # while the # Imagination is strange enough that it feels overwrought and stifling and ((some kind)) strange # with deer going # ((everything is)) strange after deer going by and ((fields were stuck with this= this)) goldenrod ((and the stifling)) Stifling ((he would sometimes # somehow it seems to his stride)) Yeah.

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	0.131	355.97	Feels good that joy lasts as long as your walk through the city and dissolves when you return home to your work to ho- how far there is left to go with it. In the fall of nineteen ninety seven, I moved into a two bedroom fat # flat, just up the street from my previous residence though here everything was different. Now I had one roommate instead of three, which meant I could occupy the living space less anonymously. The reason I at times experience certainty that I started this book in the summer of nineteen ninety eight is that through the window of this new bedroom I saw my first concrete tree. I was struck by what I thought was an anomaly until I began seeing this type of tree all over that unique city. Within the first few sentences of the novella after that, you will find the concrete tree outside my window written quite simply. {lipsmack} Years later, I would have to rewrite that passage as too many people unfamiliar with the concept, concrete tree, worried over its incongruous presence. A few months ago, I addressed this concern by changing the text to, The trees outside my window are the first in ((a)) series of architectural leaps intended to beautify this city, these saplings protected by cylindrical holes of concrete To those of you who also lived in this great cement city, I apologize for such an overt description, but there are certain things one cannot understand as o- # if one has never seen them. For instance it never snowed in my previous city, the city of the novella, yet today it is late March in my new city and flurries blow past the window I have called ((Chubby)) to tell her this and she sputters, What, what, wrapping her mind around the concept This is what you do when you're editing, isn't it? You move text around, you delete something that does not have the anticipated effect on your trial reader. You write down somewhere that you have deleted that thing, then you put a question mark beside it How many times have I been thrown into confusion when explaining to someone the cuts I've made, that person being different from the trial reader, and that person has responded with a violent shake of the head, pressing the point, I totally understand that. Put it back in The number of times I have done that matches the number of times I have run to a nearby park, thrown myself on a bench and fallen over with my head in my lap, my hands scraping the ground with the smallest of smiles on my face. Confusion is a gift, I have always thought That is the reason for the smile Similarly when I am in the midst of an overwhelming sadness, those moods that have no identifiable cause, I begin to marvel over the ability to have such feelings I write something down, usually on a loose sheet of paper, thinking the feeling's too fleeting for my diary and give that smile again, buried in the typical frown of sadness. Because what I've written is beyond me. Eventually, one comes to know what belongs in a book one is writing and what does not and eventually one changes one's mind on all of this I finished the final version of the novella after that sometime late summer two thousand and three after two extensive rewritings and probably two less intense reworkings and countless line and paragraph edits, plus two shelvings and one almost utter shredding, and then I ran outside. The relief I felt was tremendous, though ultimately short lived+. You have finished your novella, I told myself. You have made a place for it. I was in my new city when I said this I had changed cities because I could not stand to see the demise of my old one, though I was aware that I had been living in its entrails for some time. But I do not think I need to reiterate my reasons for blinding myself to that reality. As it goes, I moved, many places at first then finally settled on this new one Why am I here, I asked myself walking among its thousands of ghosts. I could not find an answer but in the interim I met a girl and became enamored with her. She will be referred to as ~M. I showed the novella to ~M once she had read my other work and upon finishing it she said, Hm, studying me. We were in a very large park. I think she turned her head to see if this park mirrored the one referred to in the novel. I didn't write it here, I explained it to her. She did not appear to believe me. Well, people will think what they want. It is their right, I suppose. But After That could never have been written in this city I wrote it in a place of perpetual sun, a place that never rose above thirty degrees Celsius. I've given up Fahrenheit in protest of the government. It never sank below ten. A place of crowds that did not overwhelm one as they do here. A place whose incomparable ease explains the near flatness of the writing, this flatness which I could never alter and always haunted me. That first summer in my new city, the sensation of my own flatness was very strong With ~M in the park, I was struck by the persistence of it this feeling which I thought had rid {NSV} # I had rid myself of by simply maturing as a person had never left me It had just taken on another form, manifesting itself differently yet deep- deeper with every subsequent book It+ strikes often at the end of the day when I'm reviewing some work I have just written and I find myself thinking that it is not writing that I have done. It is speech or air, plain air. It is zero. It is a gesture, a sign, an indication of writing, but not writing. Not at all writing.	Subject	
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76	0.207	349.904	Nowadays, I'm more or less content to let a lot of things take their own courses, like amiable rivers making blue lines down the map of history I'm not saying that some things don't infuriate me. They certainly do. But I've learned mostly through stupid repetition the same patience I apply to my own works. Moving them out of range of good and evil is applicable in a romantic way I guess to things natural and unnatural. Outside myself I'm on better terms though still able to bear grudges with most things and people, more social- socially amiable no longer stand in a corner at parties facing into the wall, smelling the ((school like)) plaster getting plastered Now I talk it up, and even when down, never talk down but remain subdued I've learned to like winters more, but hate the end of ((same)) feel relief at spring, crave sun on body, enter through the lobby of annual depression, have greater sense of personal comfort, expanding horizons, ability to survive and know how far I'll go to do in this year of famine and pestilence, have learned to keep my mind and ear cocked like a gun for the true poetry of the language to go off and fill the sky of the mind with angels conversing and have enough memory left to remember and write the angels down without pinning a single body or wing I ((have)) finally returned to the cheerfulness I had when very young before the bubbles in my personal seltzer had gone flat when the fingers of school, having opened my thinking pat # {cough} having opened my thinking cap kept the bottle open long enough to let the fun out, amidst the multitude of others asking one way or another, Whatever happened to you? You were such a cheerful kid. And that I am. Whiff An evening spent talking, spent thinking about what my life would be if I'd stayed with a particular girl or woman I went with, what would be if I'd have been accepted to and gone where I applied to a different school than the one I did, where I'd learn different social graces than the ones I have where some of the material values of the American Dream had rubbed off enough to make me live it out in the good work sense If I'd settled down and settled for the foundation on a house for future generations instead of assuming immediate # immediately past generations my foundation to mine. If I'd have been a little quicker to learn what was expected of me, and wanting to please pleased, going on that way through all eternity I've probably been saved from mere routines by a streak of stubbornness, by a slow mind and tendency to drift by an emotional development that requires my personal understanding before happening, feeling out the implications an emotion has in form of expectation, before trying out and after awareness I sense a willingness to tell someone I know and like and sense the same from anything they'd like to know about me and at the same time have a vast sense of privacy, which means there's no way I'll wear out my personality and its sense of continuity, although sometimes I feel empty. But talking to someone I like and trust and sense the same from, I feel way up and after a long evening of talk about this and that, feel wide awake and feel the world wide and awake around me and have a visual intensity and memory that in near memory dulls and throbs and grows vivid as hell. When I bring it to mind some time from then what my life would've been like under different circumstances, ((it)) would've been different with its own attendant ifs and its own what might have been But this way I've elected to follow and cast my vote each waking day in I avoid the possibility of taking the past too seriously or feeling any bitterness or sadness This way when my ship comes in I'll have passed out of mind beyond the sight of land and won't hesitate for a second to look back on all this with fondness or remiss The air'll be clear, the moon'll be there, and you, whoever you are and hope to be will be here with my love Ninth Street Old people, old people, large clouds high with expanses of high blue palm frond huts, white buildings, blue trim, sea green, tiles everybody walks slow ((they seem,)) the women have the same white sweater, the men have the same white shirt, bellies, very green grass and palms. Everyone has a ((hunch.)) They're moving their life into the road of the shoulder of life Water cool enough to refresh, thigh deep out far from the lighter greens to the darker green, head for the green blue more women than men, no smiles, visions of the endless end of life, visions of Holocausts, how easy it is to have, visions, ((whitened)) buildings, growing wider and pulsing in the blue # in the white pulse of the sun Visions of the beginning and end of work, visions of palms waving goodbye, and the sky reading me up with waving palms, light gray pebbles, streets, highways, and big hotels, big and little white curves, yellow light, the same yellow as light through window shades, only no shades, blinds, jealousies, cool breezes blowing through the moisture from the sea, very little talking, only talk fervent deals and wheels, emphatic gestures into tubby waistbands, temple chance grazing my temple through speakers as some misters and a missus pass the microphone, visions of vegetable stands, movies changing three times a week, lavender blue hair, blue gray hair, gray green water with a middle layer of halo green staring up at bridges, cars, trucks, buses, fishermen looking down straight in the deep and reeling the lure in, visions of curves and angles going every which way, keeping me awake longer than usual each night until sleep takes me over, over the water with deep blue lights, through memory of the land with puffs of light green snow, laid out neatly as far as the eye can see, over the shoulder, visions arriving over the shoulder like gulls, visions sitting and waiting for the beach to empty, and the sun to enter the lost and found.

Usually it was closer to three or four. And they fought, wherever they were together so I never made any friends that lasted and everything was various, depending on whether it was just my mother and me or whether my father was there, and whether they were trying to run a restaurant together or whether my mother was working as a waitress.

Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	0.23	482.22	Feels like home to me. I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa. Can everybody hear me alright? Okay. um I'm going to read in two parts. I'm going to read first from the new book lost parkour psalms and then I'm going to read some new amulet sonnets. So um this book, lost parkour psalms, is= is just out in France and it's a dual edition in French and in English. Th- th- # separate books but out at the same time and in the title ps- psalms, within psalms, alms is in parentheses. And about parkour I just wanted to say that it's an activity or a practice of moving rapidly usually+ through an urban setting as would a stunt person be moving and so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks involved in contemplative practice and just considering the psalm as a poetic form. So beginning with a epigram from Joanne Kyger. The place we are going is the place we were before we were born. Psalm undone. Rushing to contain and not complain what is sung Do this without assault. Therefore exist everywhere. I will make a character and one of my characters not a letter nor a frown will be undone by a new landscape. ((Missive)) psalm. How to be truthful to one's ((woods)) or were they. Never have seen such a text sudden eruptions scribes of erudite biddings ask to whom shall I send my. Vanishing psalm. I can vanish every minute of every day but to where shall I vanish? Your pleasure is in choosing the vanishing point. If you are accomplished at leaving the world in this manner at what are you accomplished? Apothecary psalm. I am so open to you who do not exist except in dream and you always reply just as I like from your book of dream. Uninscribed psalm. The hours I have forgotten to inscribe are written in silence. where speech would rather summon air overrun with visitations. The hours belong to no one. We stand or recline to incite them. Obligatory murmuring or rushing words are as nonsensical as refusing to greet your beloved. There is another way. Transparent psalm. Surrender to the form which does not appear or cling to the house you cradle and what is the third way within which appears no argument, meaning all imperatives become transparent illustrating the argument as a skeleton which impels movement so you don't complain of it or even remember this inner matter as you lift a cup to your lips. Insistence psalm. What are you leaving? A body for thoughts of a body? Where you are incessantly going is a type of insistence. An invisible leaning. You walk this way because your legs carry you. You allow yourself to expire because each morning you awaken. Psalm for expectancy. Success is also a sudden barricade from accomplishment. In cities as elsewhere we live only so long. I am just a visitor here, speaks the Rebbe when questioned as to his modest abode, a cot in a single room amid piles of books. This is just a text meaning nothing is recoverable except your recovery. This one I'm dedicating to Lisa. Psalm for conspirators. Conspirators awaken on their pages in cabinets and fences, in states of such I have never seen or states I have loved as dearly as delirium. They ((key)) or ((call)) variously. Where I am ((taught,)) they flag without such pulleys, levers, ((trance)) and delicate nets, I'm lost. Psalm in a foreign language. ((Jades)) is ((~J)) my souvenir well. Vying festoon or sacrament tour of the heart. A tout with vines consulting beauty of mesh genomics. Armor or trove as injury oh sorcerers, oh miser, oh heroine, this voyage of moon. Treasons (()) your ((taut)) joint (()) of fate. Psalm for monumental. In an airless, airless, airless, room why are we using their definition of success? What is monument? Monumental. Psalm beneath loss. Beneath the place of sorrow is another place. So miniscule found, grown larger by minuet. To be presentable is something beneath the scene ((seen)) and ((seen)) How is loss perfect? The lost psalm is not yet internally known. To write it again is to unlatch, to transmit. Any poem is constantly written, to verb and not to noun, constantly transmitted and continuously translated, rapid transit makes us dull, pulling and dismissing our most	Speaker1

Now let me just tell you if you don't know about the film, it's not like um {lipsmack} it's not like the= the um film footage of uh Theresienstadt+ and uh maybe some people don't know what Theresienstadt+ was, but during World War Two the Germans created a er a= f- a fake or a mock u- uh not # well, no- # a= a fake uh concentration camp and they they filmed everybody there and the people looked well fed and they were doing interesting things and they were happy. These= these were the Jews who had been brought from o- # elsewhere in Europe and placed there and it was you know it was kind of like a propaganda thing, you know um Well, An Unfinished Film, the person who devised this= this film um had a ver- # had something very different in mind because rather than just have it # well, I mean I think initially they wanted it # the Germans wanted it to be for publicity but they kind of went a little too far or they really got too involved because it's clear from= the= from the found footage # and by the way there's like a second camera and there may have even in # at certain points been a third camera, so like the second camera will show the first cameraman filming the inhabitants of the ghetto who are being made to act in= certain= sc- in certain scenes that have been ((uh)) orchestrated {lipsmack} uh and= uh and in fact, one of the cameramen was found and was interviewed for the film (({lipsmack})) And there are people who survived the Warsaw Ghetto who are also # they- they're filmed watching the footage and then making comments about it and uh {lipsmack} we- well so= so= so the scenes are # and this is like early in the Warsaw Ghetto so there are people who have ((uh)) been brought there from all over, you know. And some of these people have more money than= than others and you know. So I mean you see p- # you see bodies lying in the street. It's not that the Germans are not trying to show that, but what they decided to do was to show that and then show the way people reacted to that kind of thing. So they'll have people # they'll= they'll do twenty takes of people who are sort of well dressed and also poor people walking around a body that's lying on the sidewalk.

She had a peculiar vocabulary and sense of poetic narrative, and as she read I thought I could hear each word weave and twist into the lines and stanzas Quote scratched ((meek)) spread in sullen ears and windowed, thy hands turned merely brittle and to bone We ((glance)) in the poem Odin's ((wovens)) are the very ((fits)) that struck me The hard sounds of the brutal beaks and bones mixed with the mythological illusion sent my mind into a whir ((When)) later I looked up Odin comma ravens of, in my ~E ~S Hamilton, I found this The Norse god Odin, unlike Zeus, is a strange and a sullen figure, always aloof On his shoulders perched two ravens. Each day they fly through the world to bring back # bringing back the news of men One raven is named Thought and the other Memory The implications of such discoveries made a little wedge in my psyche, a tiny aperture through which uncharted thoughts had a new point of entry On this recent threshold sat ((a)) memory, met up with ((the)) barely distinguishable ((mouths)) of desire and from then on worked together to perceive this new beauty of created forms The possibility that poems could be much more than inner feelings began to unfold in my mind and I saw the poem as a ((made thing)) saw that and constructed no less than the pattern of intricate tapestry As we ((hold in my vase)) this snowflake I was stunned with disbelief to look down and see out of one frozen drop the most perfect crystalline form So my new understanding gave me the clarity I needed to write a poem as Robert Duncan wrote so beautifully but ((of)) not ((mine,)) but of a ((made)) place that is mine, it is so near to the heart {NSV} Think I should skip just to the front? No, okay. um {lipsmack} You can tell I'm from California, that like I just had my first snowflake very recently in my life. {breath} This is from the second chapter, it's called um Echo ((Ooh)) which is the secret of written intelligence. In this I'm jumping back into um my past I discovered the duplicitous nature of language quite late in my life, ((from in)) my family correct English was practically an ethical ideal My mother in law to brother Robert had a fixed idea about words, which were either right or wrong, correctly used or unforgivably misused. Using a strict principle, they created elaborate vocabulary contests to try and catch each other in the middle of an unintentional malapropism They ((spout)) out obscure words and used cleverly planned conversation topics to showcase these words My mother would trap my brother, and then he would return the favor As I watched from the sidelines, the two of them turned a large vocabulary into a finely honed tool of intimidation This vocabulary weapon was compounded when my brother Robert obtained a ((two wrong and said)) the condensed Oxford English Dictionary through a mail order book club offer It came in a blue cardboard casing with a magnifying glass ((in)) a long thin ((drawer)) at the top He would sit at our dining room table underneath the wrought iron Mexican chandelier and scan slowly= slowly down its pages, chuckling to himself {laugh} Then he'd get my attention by saying, Hey Jenn, A response to which would inevitably unleash a question such as, Are you a nymphomaniac It was a continuation of a relationship based on his knowledge and my lack of it that had begun on the day I was born five years younger than he I was about nine when I finally caught on to the perils of this information imbalance Robert had decided to tell me that an orgy was a party where little girls play jacks. I # {laugh} and I got into big trouble when I asked my mother if ((uh)) my friends and I could have an orgy on the kitchen floor. Growing up thinking language was full of booby traps set for the express purpose of revealing my ignorance, like a dress that could at any minute fall away. One would think it unlikely I would eventually become a poet I suppose I must've become addicted to the unique humiliation and constant insecurity, actually going to love the unstable ground of lingual trap doors. Or at least I found the method of navigating through them sufficiently fascinating to outweigh the peril In junior high school, my friend Katie and I cofounded a Good Word Club, of which we were the only members We never clearly defined what quality made a word good, beyond our simple ((gubernatorally preference there how the word sounded was however a huge factor, and the word good was accepted into our pantheon and all the ensuing privileges of favored status.))

And they're very French in the sense that you know, it's just sort of kind of like French theory. You're like reading along and you go, What? {laugh} You know? {laugh} Can you run that by me again? {laugh} Ha ha. Ha. um and I liked the way the wit- # this quote was um similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry in= in math i- # a= a symmetrical equation, i- it's the same in both directions. You go though all of these procedures and it's the same, so nothing actually happens and but all this stuff happens. And so you start out with the same thing at either end and um a- and I= I was interested in that idea. So it's a kind of i- # it's a kind of stasis and then symmetry is a kind of stasis Hm. and um ((uh)) but it's= a= it's a kind of quivery stasis that isn't really stasis because it just then it sort of collapses and then you have a kind of anti stasis. So this= this quote seemed to do that for me uh in a way that it was interesting and the only thing that I think that you take from it is a sense of symmetricality and that persistence in the situation. And that relates to my reading of David, which is to say you just have to stare into it and persist. Mhm. uh So I was just interested in evoking that. It doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote, it seems anti explanatory. And yet it seems kind of to have an uh nuance to # er i- # you know, numinous quality to it I liked ((Yeah.)) That was very clear ((in= in so many points to just said,)) that paragraph. Yeah, I'm taking notes. Now that's {laugh} That's wonderful. So So= uh so things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry Well, ye- # i- if asymmetry as you point out, symmetry and not symmetry are the same. So an asymmetry ass- assumes lack of symmetry and so you know They ((make up symmetry,)) yeah. (()) So how do you ever get to change? I mean how does one get # how= does= one= how does one think that through so tha- # how can one articulate that statement so that change is so that the fact of change is encompassed Think of death Yeah. {laugh} It's changed. I mean there's= there's # somebody in= in # I was just in buffalo and somebody said # asked me a question and it was uh Uh-huh. Yeah. uh, What's your position on change? Do you think change is {laugh} good? Or are you against {laugh} ((change?)) (()) {laugh} And= uh {laugh} and I= I said it just # it # you # ((we)) don't have a choice and uh it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes and uh uh and yo- # when= when things are bad you w- # you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change. And when things are good you don't want things to change because things are good and change would be bad. Mhm. But you always want something else, so you want change because you think things are going to get better. Things are not going to get better, and it's amazing that we think that {laugh} they are. Mhm. My book said the same thing. ((It's like #)) that's true. um That # if the newspaper would review them, they'd call them bleak Well you know if you're not # if you don't think things are bleak, you're not really grasping {laugh} what's going on {laugh} ((Yeah.)) Yeah. Well that kind of brings up for me the question of this um one might call this social imaginary of um using um a counting Hm. system. um For example, David you were using ten lines and uh ((you know you're)) inventing this sort of combinatory uh twenty poems, ten lines each um ((within)) various combinations. Is there any um # anything that you attached to Mhm, mhm. of um # some of larger social import to the use of that sort of counting structure, other than merely as= a= as a means ((to an ending to you?)) No, absolutely. It uh it bec- # everyone counts the same Uh-huh. Everyone in this culture counts the same. So # I mean we're agreed on ten then twenty and how you get there you know. So= uh so because {NSV} # {NSV} well it's hard to single one book out but certainly this book was concerned with epistemology and {breath} how when the words never mean exactly the same thing for any one of us as ((uh nonetheless)) of society is possible ((whereas)) I was looking for things like # i was thinking of things like teaching children to read, teaching children to count and how that is there as some kind of outside to each one of us, although it's inside us you know. That's why it's outside there. It's inside us here {lipsmack} And uh I could say more about that but seems more useful to keep responses to like a paragraph When you said, Everyone counts the same in this culture I thought, Boy, that's way not true because I thought you meant # {laugh} some of us are more equal than others. {laugh} Oh, ((not #)) no, no, no. No. No, but they should. That's right. And but you see # yeah, but that's ((als-)) # but that's # the= the way you heard that statement is also correct, for this book because there # I believe there's quite a bit about social inequity in this book although it's not called by the usual terms. Just that they uh # because they= had= they had ((Lenin.)) Now they've gone limp= {laugh} limp after being Hm. so= uh so long engorged ((that)) they are now limp. So {laugh} {laugh} One of the things that I find really fascinating about this whole process um is that it allows um me as a reader to watch each of you as a writer tackling a not exactly parallel but it's the closest thing to it project in= ess- in essentially the same space. Reading the other's work and then constructing something to say out of that process. And I am intrigued that both of you to one degree or another um I would say flirt with narrative in um as though it were behind or related to the text. You picking the film that I take it has not ever seen um even though you know ((I)) # Which is so symmetrical since the filmmaker has also not seen the film that his film was based {laugh} on.

PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	0.594	384.591	To me it was particularly telling and why I find it a compelling argument because it does challenge in some ways and initiate a bit of a rupture with a l- # uh a poetics of desire and a libidinal economy but it also (()) initiates this act of pointing um which I see a lot of in work of my contemporaries. who are spread out, not located um geographically in any particular area um that their work p- points to particular social facts usually that are disgusting or not so much that the facts are disgusting, but the people are disgusted by the facts, they're disgusted by their economic situation. They're disgusted by in Canada how following the fifth term of Reagan administration, America, Canada has to mock the same thing and= and how um arts funding is being stripped away ((and)) essentially uh a gospel of facts from the right has been initiated that (()) debt ((and)) a national debt cannot be challenged in any way that= that ((so)) the gospel (()) we can't spend because there's a debt. We have to somehow get rid of this debt before there can be any= social= uh any social services left again. So ((I was)) interested in it for its ability to make some sort of challenge and rupture and also because it um articulates this movement towards pointing at and registering disgust and anger with these social facts. Having said that, I think that it's also an contingent poetics. I don't think a poetics of disgust, if it gets taken seriously, if it gets picked up by and discussed by anyone ((and I)) hope it does because having spent the time ((editing)) the issue I think ((there's a)) # it's a really interesting collection of people. I think it's a contingent poetics. Which is something that I see emerging cross many different communities where the kind of larger plans that lead to larger works are being shunted aside in order to have a contingent poetics that's based on a more momentary set of social relations and then we could again invoke the homology of social relations in the text there ((or if)) social relations have sped up ((then)) one's poetics aren't going to be locked in. How are you going to address a rapidly transforming social sphere with a static poetics. So I see this as a move from desire to disgust but also from um a more stable long term plan which um Michel de Certeau would register as a strategy towards a shorter term tactic of the um contingent. {cough} I feel ((there's)) a bit of a presidential debate sort of here. Quite= quite interest-. I'm just waiting for the (()) commemorative coins (()) very, very nice. It'll look so great painted on plates. um Yeah.

Mhm. Steve Evans today um in his poetics uh uh email discussion ((once)) told me to change my song uh about this um and uh I responded that I will when it's warranted. um It= it sounds to me from the description as though um ((having)) reinvented a Brechtian poetics um there would then be a positing, and I'm not sure exactly where, um sort of the um # the uh inverse (()) you know, ((and)) identified our ((toe,)) and I don't know who that gets to be, whether that gets to be people of my generation generally or a specific phenomenon. um Within that and it feels to me # it= it feels to me in that sense um invariably problematic because # ((of course)) I= I I'm one of these people who tends to think that, you know, you want Brecht and Artaud sort of constantly talking to one another. um At the same time um ((while listening)) um and it= it seems in that sense to me um um problematic.

Growing up in a colonial atmosphere with displaced parents who had several languages which were not the dominant languages, et cetera et cetera. She ended up writing in English and somehow placed herself in American English but brought in all of this experience and to me that was something that was very instructive um and something that= that allowed me to try to think about ways in which places could be themselves and not at the same time because I think there's a privilege given to place which I have tried to somehow contest at the same time as I invite it and embrace it um So where I am exactly in all of that is= is extremely difficult. I mean I # there have been n- number of years in which I've simply worked in translation because I didn't know where I was in terms of where I would begin my language. That's it. Yeah, ((I don't see #)) that- that's= that's good I mean its a good answer um How about if we read a little bit? and then open it up to discussion would that work. Yeah? Can I ask a question first? You certainly may. um So I just scream it ((at her)) No, just # I'll repeat it. Speak it uh Okay. um I'm actually # this is such a simple question. I'm just wondering what you heard that made you say that's my voice Oh, well I didn't # I don't # uh a- are you asking that of me or of him? I'm asking you, yeah. uh ((Answer)) to the # ((a)) question about the answer that you gave before that uh Oh, okay. ((Yeah.)) Yeah. ((the name too, it's)) y- Yeah. um Right, well v- voice is a word that is so burdened with theoretical quasi theoretical poetic qu- quasi p- poetic overtones that # I= I did use # there was a specific word I used when I described this before, but I think I want to back up and= and try and say that a little differently because uh it c- # the idea of voice can very easily be confused with the idea of a person or poet having a voice which is= a= w- is a way to ((eliminate)) talking about that person's w- work and style and method and ((hm)) the results thereof and so forth, rather # um pretty much or at least in my view or for me ((people that.)) So uh what the wq- # so in a way the question is, What did I hear and was it a sound y- you know, because the first thing it was was a sound it was a sound of a thought, of a way of thinking, okay? So the phrase that I used that you heard me read at the end of um Absence Sensorium, We will crush the arrogant kingdom in our days, that's right from the liturgy uh ((that)) essentially is um and there are actually {laugh} many other in what # in that that= that are a way of my trying to bring forward a ((liturgy.)) Now the liturgy would # I'm going to take two minutes on this. The liturgy is= is actually a r- # a= a= a place where it's a # an anthology. The liturgy is an anth- # the= the liturgy that is the standard liturgy+ of of the tradition I grew up in which essentially is conservative Judaism and # uh w- which means Orthodox Jewish liturgy, translation okay uh is a residue of the rabbis around the uh turn of the Common Era, round # of the first few centuries. That's what it # what # and= and then again, another layer from the= uh the saf- the Safed Kabbalah, especially around the s- the Sabbath. All the liturgy around the Sabbath is from # a lot of it is from the sixteenth century from the town of Safed where a lot of Iberian Jews wound up and there was a really sort of very intense m- uh mystical and Messianic body of thought that finds itself # its way into that. So what I was hearing, I didn't know that, actually at that # I mean the point at which I heard these sounds, I did not know what this stuff was. I didn't understand I was hearing history, or people, individuals, or an anthology. So for me what I heard w- was a sound that sounded like the way I would think And then when I went and started to ((g-)) # look into it, and ((uh)) by no means am I a scholar and I don't like to pass myself off as one.

The first may simply be showing sensitivity to a formal context. The second creates a context. In every day practice, truths are detected by apprehending cadences.

Okay, I'm going to read a few more journal selections and then um ((Bruce Sanjo's)) turn. Seven Eleven Eighty Eight In order to live at the pitch of contemporary life, we acquire the ability to forgo the intervals of time that are actually needed to consolidate and make part of ourselves what we have already experienced Because of the multiplicity of life's possibilities and demands, there is little time for this Thus we gradually harden ourselves to accommodate reality and even further forget what it is like to imagine really digesting something Seven thirteen. Time out of time The more I am heard, the more I must resort to silence to be heard The faster I go, the more stealthily I must move Seven fourteen The imagination forthrightly encountered can never betray and will always reveal For this kind of encounter to be open internally, however, is as difficult and consequently as rare as in external encounters Seven eighteen. Life presents itself to us all at once at all times in its entirety Seven twenty one. Is it possible to surface unconscious aspects of the identity making mechanism and thereby experience the nexus of the percept coloring process? I think this is done and can be done again and again in new ways by reading and writing poetry. What makes us what we are is determined by what makes us see what we want to see On a social level, the gradual assertion of the rights of individuals is determined in part by the value ((that)) the society places on the individual This value not only determines what a society can do to protect the individual, but what contributions individuals can make to society If all individuals are equal, are all individuals then equally expendable? On the other hand, can an individual shed society and thereby transform it? The determination of the value of protecting the individual is also fostered by the concept of genius. It may be that genius is fostered by a mutation of a society's ills with its strengths Genius has a way of affecting society deeply, although it is asl- # always the product of an individual Another aspect of genius is that it is an idea that returns to all individuals of value by demonstrating that individuals can make a difference in helping reshape society. Just as importantly, the age of machines has intimidated human beings to the extent that they demonstrate the immense potential power of not individualizing. Equivalence of mass ((produced)) parts Society is tempted to imitate the powerful machine by making its members conform to their ways to producing so uniformly. Of course, the individual soon realizes the value in learning what are the aspects of non res- # reproducibility, which are ((a)) value Seven twenty six. Anxious, embattled. Same thing Seven twenty eight. I've lived with time so long as a limiting and controlling reality that I'm ((ruined with)) thinking of it like this. I need new images for time. I am tired of being pushed in front of it, like a child being urged to take its first step or like a pet being dragged along its staccato steps, lurching forward one moment and then seeming to drag on forever. Locked in a room, waiting for its chance to get out I can learn to accept a concept of time that is inexorable, leading to one inescapable outcome. But I can never accept a mechanical view of time that allows for no individual experience. Eight seventeen.

Nothing but the ((mar-)) No one else was walking on the highway in the blazing sun I saw the dog a hundred feet away a burly fellow half Chow, I thought, half German Shepherd. Shaggy hair plastered with mud The dog saw me too and came running towards me I walked on, afraid the dog would bite I could hear the nails of his paws clicking on the pavement, but he passed me, never looked at me, and ran along as I walked ten or twenty feet ahead, ten or twenty feet behind I did not like his looks at all The heavy brow, the square jaws, a shaggy, dirty fellow The road was as lonely as ever, marsh under the blazing sky and the motorcars went speeding past I could see the pavement of the street on the other side and the bright blue sea. It would be cooler there, and I might be rid of the dog The dog looked up after a while, saw me on the other side and he came towards me straight through the traffic I stood stock still, waiting for the dog to be hit. Sure enough the second or third car struck him and sent him sprawling on his back, squealing The brakes of the car screeched The dog leaped to his feet was knocked down again and then came running towards me You dope, I said But I was touched at his devotion. Now we went on side by side the dog close to me, and I no longer afraid Now and then we came to a stairway, leading to the beach, below other dogs who were running about on the sand, and the dog was eager to go down But he stopped waiting for me at the head of each stairway, and as I went on, followed The street turned at last, and we were back on the highway Now I was afraid to cross for fear the dog would be hit. He stood beside me, looking up at me, watching my hands and feet, ready to spring forward At last there was a break in the traffic. Only two cars coming. I could cross easily, go part of the way, let the cars pass, and then cross over But I was afraid the dog would rush on, and be hit. No, I said, Oh no. And we walked along the edge of the highway without crossing As the dog ran on beside me, sturdy and true I thought of his lifted face, the deep brown eyes watching mine. Yes, I should like to keep him, walking so together. We came to some houses. These were at the sea Cottages, refreshment stands, even a small merry go round. I stopped at a stand What should I get my dog to eat, I asked the pleasant girl behind the counter. She smiled at me and leaned over the counter to smile at the dog, as he stood beside me, wagging his tail Hamburger, she said, Dogs love it. Alright. One or two? Two She took the fresh cakes out of the icebox and put them on a square of wax paper I walked to the corner of the stand.

From inside your body, how do peonies smell? I am embarrassed by the limits of imagination, that is, how my desire fails as empathy and settles into voyeurism Have you ever deadheaded a peony I want to know not how the old felted browning petals feel but how they feel to your fingertips I wonder if I'd ask a stranger, as you must ultimately be, a question arising out of genuine curiosity I wonder if ((I'd)) dare to trespass into my neighbor's flowerbed and cut down her ugly, used up flowers Across the street Griffin+ Griffin is three and a half He walks to the edge of the driveway holding a bouncy ball He aims carefully, and then sets the ball down to roll it The ball rolls evenly Griffin's one year old sister totters carefully toward her brother on her new walking legs The ball connects with her shins, bringing her to her knees Her face bounces down, and then off the ball Griffin retrieves the ball and walks back to the edge of the driveway, starting again Griffin, honey, calls ((a)) babysitter. Griffin. I thought it was funny, ((but)) Outside my window on the second floor, two birds squabble One is a robin, and the other looks to be a crow, big and aggressive The robin is getting beat up, but stands its ground A huge gust of wind causes the bough to move from due north to due east The birds rotate before my eyes, parallel with me The wind carries the package of itself on the arguing bird voices until a pedestrian walks by and the crow is startled, slides off the bough and goes away I wanted the crow to be ashamed, to leave the branch ashamed that it had forced itself on another bird's home Then I realized that I am the crow and you are the robin, and a sense of adoration and admiration spreads through me like a new version of the weather The crow comes back again and again, and I hear the raised voices of the birds merging with the bigger, agitated voice of the wind Is it really wrong to look for evidence that will prove what you want to believe anyway? I often find what I'm looking for on a chain of continuity, the leading to or following from Here in the sequence of reason, proof that things may be connected off kilter without ((there are)) realizing the link This morning, as I was listening to the radio, I heard this story {lipsmack} A semi truck is pulling out of a gas station driveway Just as it pulls out onto the street, a man in a wheelchair rolls in front of it and gets stuck in the grill of the truck The truck driver drives four miles at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour, completely unaware of his front loaded passenger When the truck finally stops, the wheelchair is detached from the truck and its occupant is unharmed He describes the experience as, Quite a ride. That was on ~NPR too, I will say Could there be more to the crow than its obnoxiousness? Doesn't it too have a right to be hungry, to need shelter? I watch it trying to get its glossy head into the bird feeder meant for finches and sparrows. Very smart If I were the stand in for the crow, then could I convince someone to love me? I imagine watching you watch the crow, your good humor but your sense ultimately that this bird is not subtle A pest, you think, it should blow away in a summery gust Coming home from work, I see my young neighbor Griffin running up the empty sidewalk looking back over his shoulder As though, I think with amusement there was someone following him I am raking up the fallen mess of leaves and sticks in the yard when I notice that the woman next door is carrying sticks and branches out to the curb We both continue without acknowledging each other After a while, I see the man across the street sawing off a half broken branch from a tree, and then that another neighbor is silently raking up debris from the storm Far down the street, some day laborers are talking animatedly in Spanish Otherwise, there are no human voices In the middle of the night, I wake up to terrified screaming One creature preys upon another And after the screams, quite near, the wounded animal takes up a desperate snoring, breathing I turn on the porch light and the breathing stops then starts again, more irregular I can't see what is out there, even though the sound of it is so sharp that it's in my nostrils and on my tongue I wish you were here to comfort me But I make my fear correct itself.

They're carrying the wrapped cocoon on poles the earth before them is cracked. But above it, it is lined, covered by the heavy sky. They trot on its sticks. It isn't being dead. The only Paradise is not being dead. The hennaed man is, but the boys aren't. From above the lines and ridges of the brown desert, when one is flying, only when one is flying. It is a waste area.

If this occurs, it goes into it at the moment it is seen. I saw it when flying. There's a haze of billows of smoke and ridges. Man who's risen by sycophancy is remembered for no reason as defenses.

Flippering head to head on the desert, it's hanging from the cocoon, swaying on poles on which the stick, starving boys are struggling. There is no minute movement. Laying them out on a mat, dabbed to clean them, though the hennaed man is the one dead who'd been alive for only an instant and they who aren't wrapped him and are moving with him toward the billows of fire on the plain.

They get out and are standing beside it, which is pushed out and is burning in front of them and there's nothing inside them. The muscular movement is coming from some black robes blowing with no eyeholes. That or outside them, the man and the wife who's weeping with the burning car outside them. He's quiet, ((isn't jeering)) from inside movement from in him standing. The desert is outside them ((and)) the moon is. It's out in front of them so that it's in it. Bright moon is in front of them In the ((deserts that's)) on fire, the black robes blow out on it, not in the line of the spirals. They're going at a trajectory with no movement in them. I want so much to be w- where I was before I was me, trying to be in the night as day, pushed out and so it is in the day when it is night. The moon is in front. It is on the plane. The moon is in front of me so that there is nothing in me. Yet on the rim the girl spits on me for a flicker. The girl spitting on me, her being so immature that the friends stare at me, creating a conformity to which if I object I'm merely self serving. It is invalidated by having occurred in me. To be what I am before I am me. It is pushed out in the moon in front which is before rather than me. Looking at the dog lying in the gutter whose thin layer of sheath of fat is seen on the ribcage, which is open. The friends create ((this)) conformity with is limpid, occurring before. They don't have faces staring. Why did one see them before? They'd say it is self serving to see this and so anticipating. Breathing in and out. The breath is in the moon that is out side in front. It isn't in me so it doesn't matter if one is walking. It is in the trees that are in the blue sky. Birds go by. So the day is in the night at once.

I have to see the night but with my eyes closed from being tired and therefore immature Communal is completely simple being outside, only with the moon in front of me, walking with no one there, is not doing anything.

But yet as you said before in relation to the poems ((it)) like it occurs quickly as a ((procession)) {cough} but as recorded it seems to somehow want to ((just)) push the limits of what would otherwise be considered a moment.

The user friendly exhibit was installed on street corners along South Ninth Street and East Passyunk Avenue and between Carpenter and Twelfth Streets. So the uh seven figures  give a thumbnail sketch. Father Antonio I- Isoleri was an Italian immigrant who became pastor of the first Italian parish in the United States. Saint Mar- Mary Magdalene dePazzi. His service as a spiritual and secular leader from eighteen seventy to nineteen twenty six was instrumental in shaping the future of South Philadelphia's Italian-American community. The church remains a worship site while maintaining its Italian identity to this day. Its former rectory serves as the Mario Lanza Institute and Museum, honoring the tenor who used to sing the Ave Maria in his old church. Dorothy Allen is the daughter of West Indian African American parents and was born and raised in South Philadelphia. She is the founder of the Barrett Educational Center in Point Breeze and worked to provide food, social services,  job training, and a safe haven for children and teens in the neighborhood. African Americans have formed part of the South Philadelphia community since the area's earliest days. By eighteen twenty the area around South Street contained nearly three quarters of Philadelphia's African American population. Many newcomers settled west of Broad Street in Point Breeze during the Great Migration of the twentieth century. Bill McIntyre was a longshoreman and a master welder for the Independent Pier Company. He marched as a comic in the Mummers Parade for many years before founding the Shooting Stars Fancy Brigade. The parade's first Fancy Brigade. He paraded with his neighbors on New Year's Day for seventy three years. The parade traces back to mid-seventeenth century roots. The New Year's traditions of South Philadelphia's first settlers, the Swedes, blended with the traditional Mummers play of the British Isles. After more than a century of informal merrymaking, the first official parade was in nineteen oh one. ((Fabula Conto)) works as an accountant for Marriott Hotels. She helps organize Philadelphia's version of Guadalupe celebration. She was also an active participant in negotiations to increase communication between the Philadelphia police and South Philadelphia's Mexican community. This community established around the Italian Market and is mainly from the state of Puebla. The Mexican population in South Philly has grown exponentially since two thousand and one. This is due in part to migration from New York City in the wake of the September eleventh attacks. Frank ((Snock)) was the son of Polish immigrants. In the early+ twentieth century he boxed under the name Johnny ((Coffey.)) The young fighter made enough money to open Snockey's Oyster House, A neighborhood landmark that has thrived over a hundred years and counting. During the greatest influx of European immigration into Philadelphia, the Washington Avenue wharves were owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. {lipsmack} They served as a docking point for ships to unload food, finished goods, workers, and future Americans that would travel by train through the city and around the country. ((Ba Win)) is a Vietnamese refugee and a respected elder in South Philadelphia's Southeast Asian community. Active member as a volunteer, she teaches traditional Vietnamese cooking classes to young people and promotes health screenings for aging immigrants. South Philadelphia's been one of the chief destinations for the Vietnamese immigration in the ~USA since nineteen seventy five. Philadelphia has a higher percentage and numerical population of Vietnamese than New York City. Joe Tayoun's Lebanese immigrant grandparents established the family's roots in South Philly where they opened the legendary Middle East restaurant. An accomplished percussionist who learned his musical craft while working in his family business, Joe has performed across the United States, Europe, and North Africa. The Lebanese community in South Philadelphia dates back to the eighteen eighties. Father Istfan Korkemaz established Saint Maron's, the United States' first Maronite church in nineteen century, being eighteen s- eighty seven. It's located at Tenth and Ellsworth since nineteen oh one. That's why I got confused. And it continues to play a vital role in the r- # lives of Philadelphia's Lebanese American community. So that's the background. And whenever {cough} we feel like is a feel good event, so you can feel good about paintings that speak with their eyes. Feel good about Rome, even though it's far, far away. The Bangladesh agreement is something we can agree to feel good about. You can feel a poet as priest slash priest as poet. Feel good about smiles at the gates of heaven and Garibaldi as well. Feel good about the ballad of Antonio Isoleri. The icon's eyes have moved to guide a young man into spirit. To direct the poet from the smile of God, and give a new father a mission. I am crossing alps and ocean. Philadelphia awaits. La Superba falls from view, from the parish windows around him. This new world is a world of faith in what there is to become. What is to become of Montrose Street but to be built as a beam between cultures. The church's saint, a mystical nun. Her pastor a temporal shepherd. On the feast day her doors open to railroad workers walking the picket for justice. On Sunday he rails against exploiting our children as slaves.

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	0.192	394.049	Five, minor sentences can be divided into three primary and one secondary type according to clause structure. These are actually fairly important. Five point one, sequential sentences, generated from compound ones. These sentences commonly begin with conjunctions such as, And then went down to the ships. Marginal sentences, generated from complex ones in a two sen- # in this two sentence paragraph from Plasma, the second sentence is of the marginal type. They blew the whole thing up and were presented with a fragment. An obvious mistake. Five point three, elliptical sentences. Generated from simple ones. Such as, New mayor, no conflicts. n- Non elliptical sentences with no clause structure. Such as, Yes, no, or ((revolving door.)) {lipsmack} There also exist four types of situations in tagmemic analysis which also call # which also generate minor sentence types. ((Now, well)) the breakdown in the works I've read seem to be fairly arbitrary and in need of greater work. These are additions to statements, responses to questions exclamations, and finally vocatives, greetings, calls, titles, and mottoes such as, The Dodge Boys. The next question is how do sentences integrate the higher order units of meaning. The obvious first step peers towards the paragraph. And here I want to quote Voloshinov one last time. In certain crucial respects, paragraphs are analogues to exchanges in dialogue. The paragraph is something like a vitiated dialogue worked in the body of a monologic utterance. Behind the device of partitioning speech into units, which are termed paragraphs in their written form, lie orientation toward listener or reader in calculation of the latter's possible reactions. The weaker this orientation and calculation are the less organized, as regards paragraphs, our speech will be. This classic type of paragra- # th- this classic # these classic types of paragraphs are question and answer, where the question's posed and answer given by the same author, supplementation, anticipation of possible objections, the type cited in Wellek and Warren, exposition of seeming discrepancies or illogicalities in one's own argument, and so forth. Very often we make our own speech or part of it the object of discussion. In such a case, a shift occurs in the speaker's attention from the referent of his speech to the speech itself reflection over one's own words. But even this shift in verbal intention is ((in #)) conditioned by the addressee's interest. If we could imagine speech that absolutely ignored the addressee, an impossible kind of speech of course, we would have a case of speech with organic partition reduced to the minimum. Needless to say we are not thinking here of certain special types of partition shaped by the particular aims and purposes of specific ideological fields. For instance, the Strophic partition of speech and verse. Or the purely logical partition of speech of t- # of the ((tight premised)) conclusion, thesis, antithesis and the like. But we are of course thinking of exactly such things here. And I want to point out that um the thing # that the partitioning of paragraphs # the idea of a paragraph as a vitiated dialogue is something that uh is not radically different from the strategies you see in the work of David Bronwich's Essay ((Bones)), my poetry and others', and David Anton when he gave a talk over at ((Eightieth Langdon)) Street ((and)) actually described his own work in uh exactly of Voloshinov's terms as a vitiated dialogue. Rossi Landi an Italian semiotician focuses on that problem a little more closely. He suggests that the model of the above sentence integration is classically the syllogism such as in, All women were once girls, and, Some women are lawyers, some lawyers are women. Logically, these lead to a third sentence or conclusion, a higher level of meaning. Some lawyers were once girls. Literature proceeds by its ((oppression)) most often of this third sentence positing instead chains on the order of the first two. For example, here's Plasma again. He thought they were a family unit. There were seven men and four women and thirteen children in the house. Which voice was he going to record? But this integration, this assumption that all three of these intere- # these statements are interrelated, and in fact ((one rig)) higher orders of presumption about it, is in fact just a presumption. In the next paragraph in Plasma, Watton plays with the reader's recognition of that presumptiveness. That's why we talk language. Back in Sofala, I'm writing this down wallowing in a soft leather armchair. A dead dog lies in ((a)) gutter, his feet in the air. That third sentence has not much to do with previous two And uh the assumption is that s- # This is why we talk language, is again the sort of thing that you can only integrate with the previous sentence by making that what I am going to continue calling a syllogistic leap or a syllogistic movement above the level of the sentence Two paragraphs before, the separation of the sentences in Plasma is so large it has to suppress the integration of sentences all together Quote, the burden of classes is ((a)) twentieth century career He can be incredibly cruel Events are advancing at a terrifying rate Rossi Landi also gives us a final means of looking at the importance of the role of a sentence In his work Linguistics and Economics, he argues the ((homology)) that language use arises from the need to divide the work in the community and that the elaboration of language systems and labor production, up to and including all social ((production)) are essentially identical. In this point of view, a completed tool is a sentence. A hammer, for example, consists of a face, a handle, and a plane or claw Without the presence of all three hammers don't function Sentences relate to their clauses in just the same way Well, (()) Richard Stein disagreed with that All # only the manufacturer of hammers would have any use for disconnected handles	Subject

Someone speaking into a tape recorder someone with a name that sounds like yours Someone who claims she or perhaps he dreamed that they, there must have been two of them, were you That they had your hair and hands, saw through your eyes, and did the things they did to someone else, someone with the names you wanted for your own A voice that said, This story is m- # this is my story. It's the only one and the ones who are in it will never leave the rooms I have erected around their trails of rust The one who says, This is the name of the wind that took us to the story that was not yours to tell, the one that held us up to the sun, the one that documented the yearning, the burning of our hair, the clench and stench of our flesh The one who says, I want to penetrate the planes of smoke between you and your mouth. I want to steal the earthen jar where you store your bones, the ones you used to beat sunlight into metal, moonlight into stone The one who answers before you begin, The woman you're looking for is a man and that man ((has)) a name and it's the name of the door between you and the tongue you borrowed from the mouth of the one who is dead. The one whose head is mounted on the pillow beside you The head which whispers the name you cannot utter. The name you are called by when you're alone in your room and no one is listening, and the hand moving above the pages resembles a turtle dragging its burning house towards the stee- # sea {lipsmack} The one who stammers, I'd lie down beside her dress and cry The one who answers, Now that you've collected your tears in crystal vials, what will you say to the rainbows of light in their wet walls arching across your desk? What will you write on the inside of your tarnished sighs. The one who announces, You will not lift my dress over my head, you will not wear my shirt and shoes, you will not point that camera at me, you will not see me with someone else doing something that has no name. The one who answers back, When will you take off these buttons and swallow them like pills? When will you fill the room with shoelaces of seaweed and salt? (({lipsmack} And)) this is uh Angel Atrapado Twenty Four. (({breath})) It was early October, a time of gathering insect husks floating on the pools of sleep. We were in an adjacent room, licking the last of summer's slime from our fur a basket of roses wedged between our teeth. You were going to be the sweetened gum of something more one day. Once you could, a whiff of a chance, but now never is always.	Subject
