Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	74.2	77.491	and he died without seeing it returned to the way he knew it	Speaker1

Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	104.1	105.794	was a good friend of Chaucer's,	Speaker1	
Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	105.933	109.147	when a poet might not have lived to produce the works he did.	Speaker1	
Andrews-Bruce-and-Charles-North_Complete-Recording_Ear-Inn-NY_10-28-78	110.15	113.179	And it was, of the hundred twenty projected tales,	Speaker1

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	296.217	300.933	my own work I guess is just a # an extreme example of letting this happen.	Subject	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	301.552	305.301	To me it seems more truthful since it's a more	Subject	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	305.883	310.016	complete r- reflection of= of of my thought while I'm writing	Subject	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	332.26	339.9	In nineteen seventy eight, composer Elliott Carter wrote an unusual work titled Syringa for mezzo soprano, bass and chamber ensemble.	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	340.636	343.98	The bass sings a collection of Greek texts on the legend of Orpheus	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	344.418	349.121	while the mezzo soprano simultaneously sings John Ashbery's poem called Syringa.	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	349.67	354.968	Myth of Orpheus is that of the legendary singer who brings his beloved Eurydice back from death	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	355.368	361.346	an allegory about the presumed power of music an poetry to turn time back and stop irretrievable loss.	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	362.434	366.02	Even before Syringa, Ashbery had long admired Carter.	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	366.742	370.929	What is it about Carter's music that the poet finds so sympathetic to his work?	Interviewer	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	371.269	377.039	Well, the fact I guess that it's so ((um)) uh complex and yet so clear at the same time.	Subject	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	377.292	384.17	Why should that be good? Well, because I think it= it uh reflects uh experience much more accurately.	Subject

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	18.16	20.55	or do you still think that I am somebody else.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	20.886	21.577	Thank you.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	30.668	31.509	Sonnet.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	33.78	36.35	Each servant stamps the reader with a look.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	36.94	39.814	After many years, he has been brought nothing.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	40.57	43.128	The servant's frown is the reader's patience.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	43.9	47.52	The servant goes to bed. The patience rambles on	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	47.79	50.553	musing on the library's lofty holes.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	51.85	53.84	His pain is the servant's alive.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	54.33	58.575	It pushes to the top stain of the wall, its treetop's head of excitement.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	59.1	61.62	Baskets, birds, beetles, spools.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	62.07	64.177	The light walls collapse next day.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	64.75	67.184	Traffic is ((the)) reader's pictured face.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	67.88	70.347	Dear, be the tree your sleep awaits.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	70.72	72.323	Worms be your words,	Speaker1

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	85.616	90.138	This one is called How Much Longer Will I Be Able to Inhabit the Divine Sepulcher.	Speaker1

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	98.03	100.73	Do dolphins plunge bottomward to find the light?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	101.23	104.165	Or is it rock that is searched, unrelentingly.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	104.381	104.885	((Huh.))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	106.22	110.774	And if some day men with orange shovels come to break open the rock, which encases me,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	111.07	116.027	what about the light that comes in then? What about the smell of the light? What about the moss?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	116.95	119.098	In pilgrim times he wounded me.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	119.497	121.091	Since then I only lie.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	121.57	124.757	My bed of light is a furnace choking me with hell	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	125.13	127.636	and sometimes I hear salt water dripping.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	128.531	129.228	I mean it,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	129.74	135.494	because I'm one of the few to have held my breath under the house. I'll trade one red sucker for two blue ones.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	135.611	137.04	I'm named Tom.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	138.18	143.26	The light bounces off mossy rocks down to me in this glen. The neat villa	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	143.479	145.805	which when he'd had he would not ((had he of))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	146.34	148.05	And jests ((smarting and privet))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	148.909	150.488	which on hot spring nights	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	150.75	154.544	perfumes the empty rooms with the smell of sperm flushed down toilets	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	154.92	157.71	on hot summer afternoons within sight of the sea.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	158.09	160.074	If you knew why then, professor,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	160.24	161.65	reads to his friends	Speaker1

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	164.01	167.03	and the reader is carried away by a great shadow under the sea.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	168.17	170.139	Behind the steering wheel {cough}	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	170.53	172.282	a boy took out his own forehead.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	172.82	175.91	His girlfriend's head was a green bag of narcissus stems.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	176.436	177.592	Okay, you win.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	177.91	181.184	But meet me anyway at ((Cohen's)) drug store in twenty two minutes.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	182.18	183.924	What a marvel is ancient man.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	184.67	188.09	Under the tulip roots he has figured out a way to be a religious animal	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	188.38	189.908	and would be a mathematician.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	190.91	194.441	But where in ((unsuitable)) heaven can he get the heat that will make him grow?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	194.98	199.09	For he needs something, or will forever remain a dwarf, though a perfect one.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	199.22	201.179	Possessing a normal sized brain.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	201.59	204.19	But he's got to be released by giants from things.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	204.69	208.49	And as the plant grows older, it realizes it will never be a tree.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	208.8	211.152	Will probably always be haunted by a bee	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	211.5	215.12	and cultivate stupid impressions so as to not become part of the dirt.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	215.51	217.318	The dirt is mounting like a sea	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	217.878	223.34	and we say goodbye, shaking hands in front of the crashing of the waves that give our words lonesomeness	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	223.8	226.26	and make those flabby hands seem ours.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	226.88	230.47	Hands that are always writing things on mirrors for people to see later.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	231.314	233.026	Do you want them to water ((plant?))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	233.33	238.48	Tear listlessly along exchangeable ivy, carrying food to mouth, touching genitals	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	239.31	244.008	But no doubt you have understood it all now, and I am a fool. It remains for me to get better.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	244.05	247.27	and understand you so like a chair sized man.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	248.37	250.22	((Boots)) were heard on the floor above.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	250.71	253.099	In the garden the sunlight was still purple.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	253.46	257.145	But what buzzed in it had changed slightly, but not forever.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	257.6	261.47	But casting its shadow on sticks and looking around for an opening in the air	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	261.7	264.696	was quite as if it had never refused to exist differently.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	265.47	268.286	((Guys)) in the yard handled the belt he had made.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	268.69	271.57	Stars painted the garage roof crimson and black.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	272.18	276.016	He is not a man who can read these signs. His bones ((were stays))	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	276.62	284.128	and even refused to live in a world and refunded the hiss of all exists terribly near us, like you, my love and light.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	285.103	287.45	For what is obedience but the air around us	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	287.763	288.657	to the house	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	289.045	290.885	for which the ((federal)) man came	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	291.18	293.883	in a minute after the sidewalk had taken you home	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	294.175	295.021	Latin.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	295.222	296.058	Blossom.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	297.46	301.998	After which you led me to water and bade me drink, which I did, owing to your kindness.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	302.79	305.507	You would not let me out for two days and three nights,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	306.07	309.694	bringing me books bound in wild thyme and scented wild grasses	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	310.16	312.79	as if reading had any interest for me, you.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	313.44	314.655	Now you are laughing.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	315.21	317.066	Darkness interrupts my story.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	317.326	318.263	Turn on the light.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	319.46	321.141	Meanwhile, what am I going to do?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	321.699	323.983	I am growing up again, in school.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	324.11	325.82	The crisis will be very soon.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	326.4	328.67	And you twist the darkness in your fingers.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	328.97	330.638	You, who are slightly older.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	331.53	332.834	Who are you, anyway?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	333.94	335.609	And it is the color of sand,	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	335.73	338.05	the darkness, as it sifts through your hand.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	338.58	340.319	Because what does anything mean?	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	340.49	341.97	The ivy and the sand.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	342.34	344.262	((That)) boat pulled up on the shore.	Speaker1

Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	347.2	350.936	and in the light of the long sepulcher that hid death and hides me.	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	361.57	368.373	The line in this poem about the un-assassinated president uh does not have any relation to the assassination of President Kennedy	Speaker1	
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_The-Songs-We-Know-Best_1973-and-1988	368.65	370.611	since the poem was uh written	Speaker1

Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	194.985	198.085	Three summers ago, a letter turned up in my mailbox.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	198.352	206.492	It came in a white oblong envelope and was addressed to someone whose name was unfamiliar to me. Robert M Morgan of Seattle, Washington.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	207.111	210.261	Various post office markings were stamped across the front,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	210.532	214.019	Not deliverable, unable to forward, return to writer.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	214.613	220.306	Mister Morgan's name had been crossed out with a pen and beside it someone had written not at this address.	Subject

Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	230.631	236.859	Assuming that the post office had made a mistake, I checked the upper left hand corner to see who the sender was.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	237.687	242.431	There, to my absolute bewilderment, I discovered my own name and my own address.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	243.288	247.773	Not only that, but this information was printed on a custom made address label.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	248.168	253.177	One of those labels you can order in packs of two hundred from advertisements on matchbook covers.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	253.598	260.117	The spelling of my name was correct. The address was my address. And yet the fact was, and still is,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	260.38	265.204	that I have never owned or ordered a set of printed address labels in my life.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	266.219	270.159	Inside there was a single space, type written letter that began	Subject

Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	302.425	304.225	It was a contemptible letter,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	304.372	307.183	the kind of letter I would never dream of writing to anyone.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	307.37	308.047	And yet	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	308.291	309.92	it was signed with my name.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	310.726	312.912	The handwriting did not resemble mine,	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	313.21	314.607	but that was small comfort.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	315.139	319.47	Someone was out there trying to impersonate me. And as far as I know, he still is.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	321.082	324.974	One friend suggested that this was an example of mail art.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	325.555	333.706	Knowing that the letter could not be delivered to, Robert Morgan, since there was no such person, the author of the letter was actually addressing his remarks to me.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	334.717	338.502	But that would imply an unwarranted faith in the ~US Postal Service.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	338.919	346.237	And I doubt that someone who would go to the trouble of ordering address labels in my name and then sitting down to write such an arrogant, high flown letter	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	346.451	348.277	would leave anything to chance.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	348.758	349.615	Or would he?	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	349.987	354.2	Perhaps the smart alecks of this world believe that everything will always go their way.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	355.244	358.914	I have scant hope of ever getting to the bottom of this little mystery.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	359.352	364.562	The prankster did a good job of covering his tracks and he has not been heard from since.	Subject	
Auster-Paul_Complete-Reading_UB_4-26-95	365.567	372.615	What puzzles me about my own behavior is that I have not thrown away the letter even though it continues to give me chills every time I look at it.	Subject

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	35.23	39.822	Sex like a collision we know sh- # we should avoid, wedding as ~X ~X ~X.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	39.94	43.868	Do you ever hate being American? Flying Virgin, loving the master.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	46.094	48.539	I wander the aisles at Ross	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	48.62	51.574	in search of a red blouse that ties up at the back.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	51.68	58.304	I'm thinking of the hushed motion, the crawl, the dark eye ((and)) the answer, the field of light around her palm.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	60.06	62.648	Did a lot of shopping at Ross when I was writing ((these)) poems.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	62.81	65.472	I worked across the street from one, it was kind of dangerous.	Speaker1

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	93.36	101.35	I have spent the day reading lines in an art gallery, trying to let my brain crawl into them, or at least under some pastoral light.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	102.03	105.797	I think I should like to be erased, like a certain word is from these letters.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	106.17	110.42	No, I think I'd like to hold a certain feeling, like a cut thing	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	110.58	117.727	with the light shining all around your forehead, and the last failed year toppled over at the entrance to one oh one on ((Bayshore.))	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	118.19	119.476	There was a sign there	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	119.57	121.001	and a view of the hill.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	127.501	128.363	Dear Kelly.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	129.76	133.67	Sweater instead of fear, eyeliner instead of reassurance.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	133.86	135.74	Cocktail as cough suppressant.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	136.04	141.459	Real men in real bar. I mean a bar cut like a man. I mean a bar cut like a piano.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	141.54	145.61	Cut to fit around the piano. I mean a bar cut like a Yamaha baby grand	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	145.82	149.07	and a glossy drink, and your lacquered face, and instead of	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	149.307	151.419	anaphora I said anathema	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	151.57	157.03	and the piano lodged under plexiglass like a big sideways fish, and beneath the mirror is my coat check,	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	157.094	160.472	is the cusp of your hand, is a mouth moving across the t-shirt.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	160.71	168.3	Long lines of the sun instead of the wrong side of the bed. In the bed instead of on the floor. I mean in the bed, but not in the bed.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	168.49	174.834	At the corner of the mouth, mouth across the t-shirt, and there is no narrow ((sleep)) before the portrait of your imaginary wife.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	175.115	181.181	So I moved to the other side of the bed and into the other side of the apartment, and then from the second floor to the ground floor,	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	181.225	186.944	I mean the ground. I mean the sidewalk where no one was wearing any costumes and the cab filled quickly with smoke.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	190.144	190.948	Dear Kelly.	Speaker1

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	195.34	199.786	pass bits of molded white plastic that carve up the winter air.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	200.42	207.878	Garbage cars on the tracks, the absence of ice, all the city steps I have taken in my foolishly sensible shoes.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	208.964	210.898	I can spell words on paper.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	211.72	216.34	You think that's all the work you need to do, but you are not yourself, you are not this futurity.	Speaker1

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	264.766	268.176	I was thinking a lot about what it meant to move into Pacific Standard Time.	Speaker1

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	304.04	306.056	So I was thinking a lot about Pacific Standard Time.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	309.07	311.72	A shaken sense, a glass hug.	Speaker1

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	329.75	336.03	A video, ball drop, nineteen seventy four, where a ball is becoming light upon a windshield and smash.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	336.2	337.041	Like that.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	337.65	341.46	So let's ransom this hotel. Let's put a fee upon this feeling.	Speaker1

Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	396.24	398.9	The shock is how ordinary it seems.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	399.6	404.747	You think that's all the work you needed to do. You think you can mask it, like drinking from the lake.	Speaker1	
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	405.71	407.601	That line exhausts me.	Speaker1

Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	534.84	535.83	They were talking.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	536.075	538.96	An old story begun as they entered the shade	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	539.496	540.845	wherein the trees	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	541.572	544.92	address the pair of wanderers with promises of succor.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	545.444	545.999	When	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	546.531	549.856	first one friend and the other heard the branches whisper	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	550.252	552.99	as if to himself alone. And suddenly	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	553.541	556.37	a most powerful odor overcame their senses.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	557.111	557.957	And a woman,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	558.276	558.937	naked,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	559.412	563.076	broad hips and sloping a shoulder stepped out of the thicket	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	563.479	564.119	and beckoned.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	565.829	567.194	Now, both these men,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	567.619	571.932	in flight from a band of relatives who presently were pillaging their homesteads,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	572.24	572.694	hoped	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	573.429	575.88	in the remotest hollow of the forest to find	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	576.26	579.559	sanctuary and an abandoned mill of which they read.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	580.881	583.3	Yet the sight of this creature turned them.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	583.698	589.28	Where they fell to arguing, which of them first should address himself to her, who stood expectantly by.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	590.365	593.68	They decided, finally, the softest spoken should,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	594.747	597.55	he who had first heard the trees murmur.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	598.366	600.979	His companion making a joke of it, remarking	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	601.259	602.174	your mother	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	603.062	606.149	saw to it you were raised up was a due respect for womanhood.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	607.532	610.136	No sooner, however, was this agreed upon than he,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	610.434	612.864	this pleasant man, began to waver.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	613.832	618.47	Wondering whether the other might not be better for the job and even expressing doubt	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	618.625	621.865	that he himself had any rights in this matter. Perhaps,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	622.132	622.867	he chuckled.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	623.14	624.869	I'm not really here at all.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	626.2	627.619	He was pushed forward, though.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	628.359	630.68	But when he approached the lady, she told him	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	631.325	632.9	she might only yield herself.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	1.73	3.984	I thought to go to Chicago right away	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	4.115	5.261	and suddenly,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	5.643	6.762	inexplicably,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	7.053	8.359	my will failed me.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	9.63	13.91	Was it that I'd gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months?	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	14.1	15.51	That I needed no one else?	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	16.68	19.77	An older woman, a second cousin, took me in hand,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	20.41	25.74	but I was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	26.17	27.801	Whatever our ((bodies)) were up to.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	29.55	36.001	Meanwhile, I kept a close watch on that ladder activity, thinking how now I would be able to satisfy Hilda when next we met.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	36.65	39.205	The knowledge, however acquired, is power.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	41.77	44.72	I must confess my feelings towards Hilda were not unmixed.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	44.97	47.069	At times I would decide to banish her	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	47.66	49.27	((for)) she deserved nothing else.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	50.04	54.57	But then I would see that she was already banished, and that I would have to think of something else.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	58.512	64.02	Well, the first thing I had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	64.735	65.939	That's another story.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	66.63	70.07	A story all in itself and one, really, very much like this.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	70.71	72.343	So I don't have to tell it here.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	79.32	80.63	A year had passed	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	80.8	85.199	and Hilda had grown some four or five inches so that she was now six feet tall.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	86.52	91.351	Her wrists, which had been ((long)) with a kind of vulnerability I found very attractive,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	91.536	92.569	were now bony	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	92.81	94.426	as though she'd been hung from a beam.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	96.0	99.776	Her face, deprived of its previous bloom, was long and sallow.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	100.03	101.576	In short, I thought her ugly.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	102.55	105.88	Pitifully so, although when she spoke the voice was the same	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	106.03	108.458	and I was glad to feel the pain of that survival.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	110.053	114.195	Her place was by no means the palace she had caused me to infer she came from.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	114.77	117.332	I had to spend the night on a couch in the living room	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	117.83	122.469	but by now I knew this kind of evasion of the realities of one's circumstance was widespread	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	122.872	125.04	and I'd even begun to slip into it myself.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	128.72	131.46	Next day when her parents were at work, Hilda,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	131.645	134.53	who had taken the morning off, sat with me in the kitchen	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	135.13	138.08	while her boyfriend raced his motorbike up and down the block,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	138.62	141.403	looking up at the window from time to time, sneakily.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	141.66	144.125	I caught his glance once when I was looking down.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	145.495	147.032	How Hilda must have felt.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	148.02	151.72	She had returned to a different perspective, and now here I was,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	152.15	155.7	the living proof of a will she wouldn't be likely to meet many more times	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	156.16	157.991	in the corner she had settled for.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	158.86	161.74	For it was clear to me now that all was over between us.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	162.775	164.18	Listening to her talk	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	164.58	167.9	I began to despise the person I had been the year before.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	169.36	171.25	Still, I had the will to stay,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	171.47	175.46	but the will to leave under those circumstances offered more possibilities	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	175.78	178.069	and so I bowed gracefully to the inevitable.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	180.3	183.31	When I got up to go, tears did come to her eyes.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	183.765	185.514	That moment I remember still	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	186.73	193.195	and I recognized immediately a feeling to be stored up against the ease, if not the indifference, of times to come.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	194.02	195.592	Many times in the future	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	196.05	199.386	I was to conjure that farewell when I was filled with despair	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	199.98	202.23	and often it sufficed to tip the balance	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	202.57	206.51	so that it could be thought to have caused several destructive rages over the years.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	207.98	209.998	But it's all water under the bridge now.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	210.82	212.707	Hardly worth the trouble of telling	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	213.03	216.22	and it's past time already to think that I have told it poorly	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	216.6	218.377	and to see that, like it or not,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	218.837	220.923	there's nothing I can do about that either.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	222.63	224.68	Yes, it might have all been otherwise	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	225.12	229.352	and yet for what it has to say about the human will in one of its manifestations,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	229.737	232.002	I wouldn't change one moment of the misery.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	232.44	235.278	For an easier way is not necessarily a better.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	236.51	239.95	and I believe I can speak not only for myself, but for Hilda,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	240.7	243.03	who found out what it was like to meet her match.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	243.43	245.01	A man who scorned to take	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	245.17	247.279	either no or yes for an answer.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	253.42	254.207	((Okay.))	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	260.893	265.3	Now th- these are a series of short pieces with a general title of tight corners	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	267.349	267.757	{cough}	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	273.114	275.926	Have I been reading about twenty five minutes? Feels like it.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	276.367	277.128	What's the time?	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	279.337	280.146	Yeah I have	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	280.54	283.093	Okay. I'll= read= I'll read for about ten minutes more.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	291.7	295.62	The boy, elbows bent, supports himself with his hands.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	296.18	297.452	His body prone	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	298.12	302.58	so that his face may approach the surface of this small pond from which he drinks.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	303.782	305.624	At his back the lane goes on	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	305.93	307.305	and the sheep go with it.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	307.87	311.053	The black dog at their back, possibly a reminder of the artist	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	311.861	312.978	or one's self.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	314.06	317.699	Further on, one wants to say, though in another sense it's higher up,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	318.39	321.849	the lane crooks out of the shade and finds an open meadow	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	322.58	325.85	from where there must be a better view of that squat church tower.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	327.2	328.335	But the clouds,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	329.25	331.119	the clouds are more surely the point.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	331.89	334.339	Such clouds as are no longer to be seen.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	335.293	338.026	A rhythm of contraction would pull one in,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	338.32	339.82	deeper into itself,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	340.38	342.23	before that open space.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	342.62	343.968	Meadow and sky	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	344.564	345.8	is granted one.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	352.71	355.495	These are very loosely sequential and uh it's=	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	357.65	360.046	it's happiest for me if I just uh make up	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	360.49	362.278	a different way through it each time.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	362.885	363.475	So.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	365.13	367.924	The pause is only while ((the eye selects)) something to do.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	368.64	371.262	While they watch the cat, while they watch (({laugh}))	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	371.61	374.94	While they watch, the cat stalks up the path to the front door,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	375.7	378.43	raises itself by putting its front paws	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	378.64	380.832	as high as it can reach against the door	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	381.24	383.561	and then, resting on its left forefoot,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	384.17	388.711	it raises its right so that the knocker is moved out until the arc of the paw	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	388.96	390.95	falls below the arc the knocker makes	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	391.28	394.829	and thus the knocker falls back against the metal inset in the door	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	395.37	396.57	and as they watch,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	396.69	397.93	the door opens	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	398.118	399.55	and the cat slips in	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	399.86	401.65	as a woman's face appears	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	402.055	403.329	peering into the street.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	414.74	418.07	The two men have been walking for a long time, one thinks	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	418.6	420.286	though perhaps no more than an hour.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	421.07	427.093	It's now becoming obvious that he has chosen the less traveled of two highways out of town in the direction he and his friend want to go.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	428.351	430.3	His friend was right, and he was wrong.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	431.3	435.49	They resolve to take the cutoff they are now approaching, and to walk its length,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	435.94	437.7	if no farm truck comes along,	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	438.09	439.651	until the other highway is reached.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	440.36	441.809	The heat is considerable.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	442.02	443.567	It is early afternoon.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	443.98	447.481	On either hand huge fields of wheat find no wind to stir them.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	448.52	450.601	The only food they have is a chocolate bar.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	451.51	455.193	The time comes to eat it, and one unslings the pack and they take it out.	Speaker1	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	0.122	3.098	When the bunk shook so hard stuff fell from the ceiling	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	3.714	5.319	he saw whose hand it was.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	6.191	12.181	But the woman had pulled him so strongly into her front that a button of her dress had dug in his cheek above the bone	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	12.489	13.902	and that pain took over.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	16.196	17.09	But= after= that=	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	19.013	19.944	but after that,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	21.074	22.471	he saw the hand often,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	23.113	25.093	looking where it was cut through	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	26.404	28.553	just like the meat in the butcher's.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	30.081	32.013	There was something he wanted to do with it.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	32.697	35.556	He picked it up and felt it from outside and then from in	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	36.078	37.189	as though he wore it	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	37.482	38.593	on his wrist	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	39.05	40.479	like his own hands.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	42.931	46.77	He still searched for the jagged metals, but now his father had told him	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	47.258	48.327	where it came from.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	48.969	52.512	He treasured particularly those pieces molded like a screw.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	53.196	54.106	You save them up,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	54.425	54.969	hoping	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	55.151	58.846	he'd one day have all the pieces and be able to put them together	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	59.069	60.398	like a jigsaw puzzle	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	60.817	62.235	and build a shell of his own.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	63.661	64.72	Would it be mine?	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	65.334	66.371	He asked the father,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	66.879	67.97	or the governments?	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	68.83	69.978	His father told him	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	70.349	70.962	his,	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	71.291	72.439	if he kept it hidden.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	73.505	75.082	So there was that to think about.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	75.628	78.709	He could go out looking in the gutters when the sounds came	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	79.161	79.997	late at night.	Subject	
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_New-Poems_Unknown-Reel	83.544	85.529	I want to start with a book with	Subject

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	556.02	557.862	I pray the dictionary.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	558.787	559.366	I ask	Speaker1

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	561.86	564.441	I feared scorpions in their silence	Speaker1

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	567.07	569.164	into the rising mountain.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	570.05	572.812	I vowed not to become the nullifying	Speaker1

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	584.99	586.825	From the marrow of consciousness	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	587.4	590.26	the living aspect of which appears solid	Speaker1

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	618.48	620.785	A mind is more akin to the moment.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	621.365	622.543	If you could hold it	Speaker1

Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	653.449	654.72	Scorpion ode.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	656.145	657.97	I watched the reader read	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	658.92	662.217	and the scores upon calendars looked back upon me	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	662.43	666.82	I tried to read from the book but even magnified I could not see it.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	667.54	670.527	What scurried beneath the book I cannot say.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	671.93	673.43	I hung upon the walls.	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	673.937	675.12	Not regret,	Speaker1	
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	675.726	676.556	but a ship	Speaker1

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	0.035	5.69	um A fascinating thing and= and now we've both had a chance to read more literary history		
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	5.8	9.942	so= so we know going back to Blake, of course, who was such an outsider and printed	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	9.95	10.412	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	10.175	13.559	and engraved # create his own engraving techniques, his own books,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	13.759	14.568	but um	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	14.72	18.46	most l- literary # most poets exist within	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	19.51	21.724	you know, micro networks of	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	22.432	23.706	publishers or	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	23.85	25.944	bookstores that publish their work,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	26.094	30.535	that circulate to other poets, and you can sort of trace what those networks are	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	30.41	31.027	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	30.96	32.362	and I'm not saying network in a	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	32.96	35.58	contemporary {laugh} bureaucratic sense, I mean	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	34.608	35.38	Right, yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	35.96	40.688	you could trace those connections by looking at the where the books f- # the flow of the books	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	36.053	36.584	Yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	37.516	38.288	Oh, yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	40.62	41.461	Absolutely.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	40.875	45.148	and who publishes them. So you're really ((right at the center.)) So while you ((might))	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	41.817	44.474	Yeah, that's one of the most interesting # yeah.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	45.172	48.69	found it, and I could imagine quite difficult, because distribution is	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	49.14	54.436	always a- a very difficult and unrewarding thing. Nonetheless, you learned a lot about the	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	55.07	56.237	# what was going on,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	56.432	57.807	how things worked.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	57.084	60.195	Well, yeah, I did and I # but I- I was also	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	60.42	62.556	st- # I was traveling a bit	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	62.66	67.118	and visiting libraries and that's how I was selling the books that we were distributing.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	67.7	74.765	People rarely bought anything from a list that we would send out, but if I would go around and visit people in special collections libraries	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	74.384	74.942	Yeah.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	75.04	76.875	they would invariably buy	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	77.16	78.98	many things, maybe	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	78.497	80.486	So that's when you got started with the	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	81.28	86.07	um # your relationship with= with special collections and libraries and ((placing)) books.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	84.752	89.47	That started it, the distribution and then # but then I realized when I did the Cage book I-	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	89.918	93.2	I knew that if I went around and showed it to people that they	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	93.766	96.197	# I would be able to sell this, you know, and	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	95.061	95.572	Yeah.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	96.37	98.103	so what made it possible	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	98.58	99.716	um having that	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	99.975	105.842	end point, you know, that end user point in mind and ((I'd)) met a lot of people by then	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	106.43	110.647	um I did # early # in the early eighties I came out and	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	110.853	116.053	attended the # something called rare book school, that was a summer program at Columbia University,	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	114.523	115.172	Mhm.	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	116.504	117.527	and this was uh	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	117.61	118.446	filled with	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	119.28	123.04	all kinds of librarians from around the country and elsewhere	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	123.592	125.78	((studying)) aspects of rare books	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	126.017	126.602	um	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	127.1	130.89	and that was very useful in beginning to meet people, some of them I	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	131.0	135.544	still know now. All this time, and they were at the beginning of their career then as well.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	134.956	135.526	((Yeah.))	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	135.598	137.566	Now m- maybe a	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	135.903	137.529	{cough}	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	137.794	139.26	unfair or a	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	139.51	145.85	stereotype, but a lot of people involved with r- rare books for sure, but fine press printing	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	146.51	147.789	apart from you and	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	148.3	155.393	Charles Alexander and a, you know, a few others and leaving aside the cheaper use of letterpress by (()) Burning Deck or 	Speaker1

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	163.294	163.835	Mhm.	Speaker2	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	164.26	169.38	((known)) works and it would be about the way in which those works were printed and set	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	169.778	171.116	or more conventional	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	171.5	173.44	writing, so you were combining	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	174.18	176.57	very radical poetic content,	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	177.19	179.415	radical in the sense of	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	179.83	181.05	unconventional	Speaker1	
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	181.433	182.648	and contemporary	Speaker1

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	183.334	185.148	versus more traditional	Speaker1

Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	32.09	36.284	Yes, I'm= I'm Liberty+ and my doctor called to say that it was ready.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	36.705	44.28	Unfortunately we just received a court order restraining us from releasing ((burqa)) results until the test patent dispute is resolved.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	44.49	46.018	But I have good news for you	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	46.31	54.86	So you wouldn't have to come here for nothing we ran an additional test at no extra charge and you don't have any mutations in your human rights gene.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	56.546	62.99	((Gal)) was spinning around and um doing a high five. {laugh} Did= you= did you say human rights?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	63.35	66.59	That's a political doctrine, not a medical condition.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	67.485	69.64	That's so twentieth century.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	70.19	74.198	The new scanners we have can recognize inherent dignity.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	75.41	76.9	Lib thinks Gal is joking.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	77.08	80.59	And the gene for evil has a little black mustache?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	81.882	87.808	Hm. There are tons of mutations for the human rights gene. There may be one for scratchy facial hair.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	88.99	97.99	Lib eggs her on. So um let's say I take a direct hit from the big scratch. I- I won't be so bad because you've got my back with your skateboard.	Speaker1

Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	113.265	114.405	Let me get this straight.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	115.31	116.661	If I think evil	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	116.97	119.364	is all taken care of with the genetic test	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	119.74	126.93	I won't notice that I can be incarcerated for an indefinite period of time without a lawyer, secretly flown to another country and tortured?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	128.21	134.4	Well, if you travel to a developing country, we do recommend keeping this test result with your passport.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	135.668	137.69	But I'm without human rights here in America.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	138.24	141.55	I can be picked up today as I leave this building and never be seen again.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	142.24	143.443	No way.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	143.259	144.271	Yes way.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	145.033	149.62	Liberty+ pulls a uh Washington Post news article from her pocket and hands it to Gal.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	150.04	152.68	I carry this with me at all times to remind me	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	152.81	154.67	of all the rights I don't have.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	156.07	162.137	Something as serious as the indefinite detention of citizens becoming law was on page	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	162.227	164.948	~A six instead of on the front page?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	165.65	168.07	Well, at least it wasn't in the style section.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	169.74	175.6	Well, let's hope that the clinical trials for the human rights mutation drugs are successful ~A ~S ~A ~P.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	176.06	177.36	Clinical trials?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	178.15	186.224	Yep. The pharmaceutical companies are all over this one. They need to get some new drugs in the pipeline because their top money makers are going generic.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	186.56	192.95	Don't worry, the National Institutes of Health scientists are making sure the trials are the creme de la creme of research.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	194.11	196.04	Lib has an a ha moment.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	196.707	197.447	So,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	198.13	199.96	~U ~S taxpayers are funding this?	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	200.625	201.3	Right.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	201.977	203.042	Terrific.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	203.44	210.008	By law, publicly funded clinical trial participants must be given standard of care for whatever is being tested, so	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	210.214	211.413	for a human rights drug	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	211.61	213.8	that means they get universal healthcare.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	214.139	215.012	Then	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	215.26	216.565	when the trials are completed	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	216.632	218.963	we'll use the march in rights of the Bayh-Dole act	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	219.068	221.079	to get the money to restructure our health system.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	221.99	225.102	Bayh-Dole? Is that some sort of welfare scam?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	225.74	227.06	Yeah, you could say that.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	227.252	228.349	For the drug companies.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	228.56	237.355	The government gives our money to researchers to test and patent drugs. Then the pharmaceutical companies license them and make billions of dollars on our dime,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	237.531	237.918	but	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	238.42	242.504	there's a little known clause in the law that says if the public safety is at risk	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	242.645	245.772	the government can march in and take back the patents.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	245.97	247.65	Deepening her voice {NSV}	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	248.065	250.632	universal healthcare for the public safety.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	251.46	254.774	It will be so cool when health is finally a human right.	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	255.087	256.024	Well,	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	256.234	258.907	health isn't a right, it's something we do.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	259.01	260.69	If we think of health as a right	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	260.83	265.93	then it's something we're owed which by definition means it's something someone else has.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	266.601	270.476	In this case that would be the healthcare corporations and big pharma, we don't want that.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	270.598	274.895	But we can take back our healthcare system and rebuild it as a cooperative enterprise	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	274.948	278.107	with the profits from the patents ((on)) taxpayer funded research.	Speaker1	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	279.07	282.77	Now this will really be fun to do when we march in, can I have my iPod?	Speaker2	
Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	282.656	286.857	{laugh} You bet, we'll all be on a roll. {laugh}	Speaker1

Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88	9.482	18.606	But beneath that and almost certainly unintentionally, the broader question being asked is why do we adjectivize at all? How do we come to say bad of that	Subject	
Davies-Alan_01_Complete-Reading_2-13-88	19.489	22.305	It is in the context of this that he asks, quote	Subject

DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	0.55	13.026	The ((beats)) were almost always serious too, I remember. That got me into the literary quarterlies and through the (()) writer's workshop and helped me understand my own dark corners and sharp angles and then one day I realized how much of what I was reading and often admiring	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	13.35	20.895	going on around me in the poetry world was a kind of picking of scabs and flashing the open sores and wounds as badges and credentials	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	21.25	25.334	and how O'Hara totally sidestepped that contemporary tendency by tone	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	25.81	31.507	and choice of vocabulary that cut through the hopelessness of so much poetry and replaced it with the joy of writing a poem.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	32.07	33.97	What a simple but wonderful revelation,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	35.02	36.775	the joy of writing it down.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	37.481	38.21	That was what	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	38.86	46.154	(()) # that was what it suddenly seemed to be about, in a way that made me think of all I had heard the painters of his time were trying to do, get across the action of the	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	46.182	52.194	creating rather than the product that was so finished it showed no signs of the activity, the energy and spirit of the actual work	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	52.515	53.297	that went into it.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	53.77	57.108	O'Hara's poems were little excursions into the act of writing poems	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	57.54	61.485	with the kind of mindset that keeps us trying sex with strangers again and again.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	62.0	63.76	The hope that this time is going to be great,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	64.64	65.908	give us much pleasure,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	66.175	74.042	and satisfy a lot of frustration and totally annul the boring, horrible, deadening, killing in fact, effects of living the modern urban existence.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	75.808	77.637	I think I rewrote that phrase.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	78.4	86.02	But I still couldn't reconcile that achievement with the personal references, though they were becoming more and more familiar and thus less and less elitist, though still somewhat obscure.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	86.45	92.808	And one day I was teaching contemporary poetry to a college class and talking about a poem of O'Hara's, I think it was a step away from them.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	93.01	100.32	After talking about the poem Steps and how it overcame the sadness of love's ending or going sour amid the big city grind and in discussing how it did this	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	100.521	107.48	((mostly)) ((through)) the structure of the poem because by then I'd learned so much about movement and rhythm and construction I could see how well made O'Hara's poems are despite	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	107.81	116.305	or maybe because of their conversational flow, and in the process of explaining why the poems were good from a strategic and structural point of view because they accomplished this message of hope	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	116.68	123.834	in the face of contemporary despair and despite well-founded reasons for lamenting our condition or his condition in the specific circumstances of the poem	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	124.16	137.404	and did it through technical agility so refined the surface ambience of ease and a kind of glib grace was hardly disturbed, suddenly I caught myself starting to cry, and I never cried back then, in fact except for a short interlude of about a year of weepiness I never cried period	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	137.78	148.39	except over old movies or musicals and it was that heartstring O'Hara had suddenly plucked in me through his poetry that sang so naturally and yet skillfully of overcoming stupidity and tediousness of so much of life.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	149.72	162.728	The true romantic, only without the pretentious and really elitist self-conscious and self-satisfied seriousness of the walking ((wounds)) of contemporary poetry because by mocking the tone of the real and original romantics partly through the use of quotation marks and italics,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	163.17	168.727	which is a sort of what ((campy)) dialogue often depends on, as others have pointed out it means talking in italics	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	169.37	177.245	and exclamation points and exclamations. Oh, he was making himself vulnerable to a (()) scalpel unlike the confessional poets and others of his contemporaries.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	177.48	184.477	Even the seemingly honest beats who always exposed themselves in ways that demanded applause or appreciation for the courage of the exposure	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	184.484	187.91	or the extent of self-destruction the exposure caused ((or)) exposed,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	189.3	204.087	et cetera. But not O'Hara, his defenses were the shrewdest and toughest of all because they weren't defensive at all but appeared to be all offensive, only the offensive was mounted against his own and others' defensiveness, thus he could be attacked for ((elitism)) when he's in fact he's our most democratic poet since Whitman.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	204.75	214.85	bringing that tradition full circle by reversing Whitman's posing as the common man brother to all which reduced everyone to the level of anonymity that Whitman's poems ensured would never really be his fate, so he could afford it.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	215.497	223.464	I'm talking about the ((pose)) which perhaps became a reality much the way Ginsberg seems to have which is not the poetry because Whitman's poetry is often wonderful and amazing	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	223.68	231.339	and very much more the source of much that is associated with O'Hara and the New York school than many of the French writers constantly attributed with having influenced the New York scene.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	231.94	247.748	Although O'Hara is also sort of a Baude- # Baudelairean reverse making the most of the worst of Baudelaire's pessimistic predictions about urban existence by preserving the best of perceptions and emotionalisms the city scene can generate, but instead O'Hara elevates everyone to the level and attentive familiarity of stars,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	248.18	254.748	throwing in the names of personal friends alongside those of personal heroes and famous and world-renowned producers and creators of the culture	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	254.99	261.354	that has come to be ours and which he defined before most of us and with the clarity of the lyrics of a Hollywood musical or a Madison Avenue add.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	261.74	266.144	Yet with all the subtlety and imaginative exuberance of a great wit and passionate lover.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	266.63	269.35	((What)) an incredibly seductive combination for a poet.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	269.79	270.867	((His)) poems are sexy.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	271.41	283.407	The language is often intimate, the images voluptuous and often exotic, the energy seemingly endless to the point usually reassuring and flattering with just enough ((elusive)) connections to make us want to put out the time and energy to make ourselves as attractively intelligent	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	283.63	287.161	and perceptive and experienced and in the know as the poems assume we are.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	288.2	290.964	He refused to accept an audience that was not as good as he was	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	291.038	298.97	and in that way included us all in the community of friends he admired and addressed and referred to along with the proper names and familiar rhythms of the most ordinary people and things	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	299.93	307.977	all of which he incorporated into descriptions and narratives that included the proper names ((and)) rhythms of the most extraordinary things the rest of us are only now (()) after the poems were written=	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	308.014	308.577	written,	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	308.767	312.962	getting hip to and how well they fit and work and complete the artistry of O'Hara's genius.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	313.71	323.13	He helped me realize that the reason I wrote poems was often simply because the rush, the feeling that accompanied the writing of the poem, especially when it seemed to be coming out good, couldn't be duplicated anywhere else.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	323.52	332.868	It wasn't a substitute for anything else, going to bed with someone beautiful and tough, or eating a delicious and totally satisfying meal, or outwitting a horribly abusive competitive creep ((in a)) conversation.	Speaker1	
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	333.23	342.938	and it wasn't a grueling act of anguish and pain, getting in touch with all the ((crabbed)) secrets of the psyche and exposing to them to the well-organized and systematic scrutiny of some poetic form or strategy, ((no))

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	86.621	90.644	So as I was writing this piece, along came a press release from Joy Garnett.	Subject

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	109.316	142.863	um She said she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates. And I thought, Yes, this is so interesting.

And I could tell she was having that same experience ((and)) that these things just come out ((during it)) stops her and she thinks, What an amazing image.

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	143.843	150.742	So, again I know that experience. I sit down. I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again.	Subject

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	187.654	205.093	What is it to make you know poetry and text into a book? What does it mean to create ex- # aesthetic expressions?

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08	244.989	276.003	Or is it actually the work that demonstrates the importance of the relationship between capital and art, in order to keep its status? I think this is an important and serious work. and I think it tells us a lot. I don't think you can bracket it out. Quite the contrary. This is the high- # most highly prized work by a contemporary artist, even if he's the person who bought it from himself, in part. The point is that it {laugh} tells us something. Tell us ((to God.))

Her hundred and eighty dollar shirt thin and delicate as those emulsions. Film she fetishizes floats off their paper back. With tiny tweezers I make delicate compositions. Petal by small petal since when I was a child. I love nature, natural forms. I used to collect the cuttings that fell from my father's hand. My father he was a botanist, a professor and a gardener. And all this time her bare legs, thin and mottled, balanced precariously. Even thin as she was of the near invisible but very, very pointed anxiously high heeled sandals, her long blonde hair, curled, who does that now, to line her shoulders, shining like her eyes.

At eighteen she was pale, fierce, erect, prouder at twenty two. At thirty an iron maiden, resolute and commanding. At thirty seven, an intimidating force. At sixty, severe and twisted.

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	225.987	234.36	And this finally turned out then to be a poem not only about what I always thought it was about, which is the impossibility of finding a proper name for everything,	Subject

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	254.093	265.501	and too many bad connotations are connected with it. Anyhow, I think all children always know that the so called happy endings of fairy tales are lies.	Subject

Howe-Susan_Complete-Recording_Emily-Dickinson-Lecture_Buffalo_9-28-90	536.724	537.964	This is one of these poems.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	0.23	5.67	Feels like home to me. I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	6.097	7.44	Can everybody hear me alright?	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	8.02	8.444	Okay.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	9.05	9.506	um	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	9.71	18.23	I'm going to read in two parts. I'm going to read first from the new book lost parkour psalms and then I'm going to read some new amulet sonnets.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	19.71	20.637	So	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	21.239	27.35	um this book, lost parkour psalms, is= is just out in France and it's a dual edition	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	28.007	32.7	in French and in English. Th- th- # separate books but out at the same time	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	33.531	38.181	and in the title ps- psalms, within psalms, alms	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	38.436	39.587	is in parentheses.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	40.327	44.47	And about parkour I just wanted to say that it's an activity	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	44.72	47.42	or a practice of moving rapidly	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	47.58	53.217	usually+ through an urban setting as would a stunt person be moving	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	53.439	58.11	and so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	58.252	59.59	involved in	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	59.972	61.833	contemplative practice	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	62.094	62.598	and	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	62.884	64.61	just considering the psalm	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	64.759	66.24	as a poetic form.	Speaker1	
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	71.55	75.462	So beginning with a epigram from Joanne Kyger.	Speaker1

Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08	316.668	323.105	Could there be more to the crow than its obnoxiousness? Doesn't it too have a right to be hungry, to need shelter?	Subject	
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08	324.295	330.233	I watch it trying to get its glossy head into the bird feeder meant for finches and sparrows. Very smart	Subject

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	81.961	84.16	You have to supply the synthesis.	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	89.1	94.9	The sound of car doors closing and voices from the street, an engine starts up, revving to pull away.	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	102.15	103.94	Then jet noise overhead.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	104.51	106.4	Who stays behind to report?	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	106.756	107.576	And who	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	114.97	118.983	Writing in place, the illusion of movement meets the illusion of standing still.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	119.1	121.217	A philosophical encounter with rhythm.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	121.41	124.41	Counting time in a forest of symbols, batter up.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	125.09	130.381	Throwing a few change ups, whatever's working that night, replacing Mark Redman as part of the double switch.	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	145.87	147.602	Jet noise trails away.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	148.262	152.06	Going to great lengths, riding up front on the handlebars.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	153.684	154.44	This train.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	156.1	157.561	Driving that train.	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	164.49	166.161	Ain't no more ((cane.))	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	167.29	168.932	The essentials scatter	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	169.33	170.905	all over the parking lot.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	171.75	175.061	The rhythm of the rails. Cows disappear out the window.	Speaker1

Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	185.16	186.45	The silver rings.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	187.41	189.885	The medium blue topaz spoke to her	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	190.2	193.4	and when she looked more closely, displayed its laughter.	Speaker1	
Robinson-Kit_Complete-Reading_POG-Drawing-Studio_10-24-09	194.62	199.63	The theoreticians of empire tripping over the symmetries of their own semantics.	Speaker1

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	131.035	143.593	these classic types of paragraphs are question and answer, where the question's posed and answer given by the same author, supplementation, anticipation of possible objections, the type cited in Wellek and Warren,	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	143.96	149.227	exposition of seeming discrepancies or illogicalities in one's own argument, and so forth.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	149.817	153.488	Very often we make our own speech or part of it the object of discussion.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	154.029	161.962	In such a case, a shift occurs in the speaker's attention from the referent of his speech to the speech itself reflection over one's own words.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	162.29	167.286	But even this shift in verbal intention is ((in #)) conditioned by the addressee's interest.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	167.75	172.004	If we could imagine speech that absolutely ignored the addressee,	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	172.314	179.292	an impossible kind of speech of course, we would have a case of speech with organic partition reduced to the minimum.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	179.631	192.147	Needless to say we are not thinking here of certain special types of partition shaped by the particular aims and purposes of specific ideological fields. For instance, the Strophic partition of speech and verse.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	192.427	199.746	Or the purely logical partition of speech of t- # of the ((tight premised)) conclusion, thesis, antithesis and the like.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	200.546	203.244	But we are of course thinking of exactly such things here.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	204.736	214.819	And I want to point out that um the thing # that the partitioning of paragraphs # the idea of a paragraph as a vitiated dialogue is something that uh	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	215.262	229.771	is not radically different from the strategies you see in the work of David Bronwich's Essay ((Bones)), my poetry and others', and David Anton when he gave a talk over at ((Eightieth Langdon)) Street ((and)) actually described his own work in uh exactly of Voloshinov's terms as a vitiated dialogue.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	230.583	231.653	Rossi Landi	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	232.012	233.504	an Italian semiotician	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	233.833	236.403	focuses on that problem a little more closely.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	236.874	240.012	He suggests that the model of the above sentence	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	240.419	246.643	integration is classically the syllogism such as in, All women were once girls,	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	247.067	249.874	and, Some women are lawyers, some lawyers are women.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	250.76	257.558	Logically, these lead to a third sentence or conclusion, a higher level of meaning. Some lawyers were once girls.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	258.115	266.221	Literature proceeds by its ((oppression)) most often of this third sentence positing instead chains on the order of the first two.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	266.498	270.664	For example, here's Plasma again. He thought they were a family unit.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	271.104	276.709	There were seven men and four women and thirteen children in the house. Which voice was he going to record?	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	278.026	279.543	But this integration,	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	281.333	290.919	this assumption that all three of these intere- # these statements are interrelated, and in fact ((one rig)) higher orders of presumption about it, is in fact just a presumption.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	291.374	297.113	In the next paragraph in Plasma, Watton plays with the reader's recognition of that presumptiveness.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	297.618	299.461	That's why we talk language.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	299.968	307.702	Back in Sofala, I'm writing this down wallowing in a soft leather armchair. A dead dog lies in ((a)) gutter, his feet in the air.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	308.87	311.962	That third sentence has not much to do with previous two	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	312.418	326.791	And uh the assumption is that s- # This is why we talk language, is again the sort of thing that you can only integrate with the previous sentence by making that what I am going to continue calling a syllogistic leap or a syllogistic movement above the level of the sentence	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	327.408	335.69	Two paragraphs before, the separation of the sentences in Plasma is so large it has to suppress the integration of sentences all together	Subject

Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	345.828	350.249	Rossi Landi also gives us a final means of looking at the importance of the role of a sentence	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	350.599	359.258	In his work Linguistics and Economics, he argues the ((homology)) that language use arises from the need to divide the work in the community	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	359.669	370.919	and that the elaboration of language systems and labor production, up to and including all social ((production)) are essentially identical. In this point of view, a completed tool is a sentence.	Subject	
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	371.411	377.281	A hammer, for example, consists of a face, a handle, and a plane or claw	Subject

Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	284.355	285.92	Mostly they complain.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	286.9	289.77	Boober bangs the lid for them to calm down.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	291.544	292.764	It doesn't work.	Speaker1

Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	309.971	312.29	Sometimes Boober and me smoke pot.	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	315.0	319.512	Other times, usually while banging, Boober has a twi- twitch of sympathy	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	319.71	325.487	but always for himself and he calls the phone and= it= and it says anything so he bangs on it too	Speaker1	
Smith-Rod_01_Complete-Recording_University-at-Buffalo_2-25-98	325.754	332.291	and I feel sorry for it and hang around with all these other things in the room wondering about this banging toad in my life.	Speaker1
