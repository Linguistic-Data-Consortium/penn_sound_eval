Gas Station Technological, annoying, miniature asshole of the stars, this is the one that will run you into trouble, but a coin in the right place can do wonders, to be reckoned with on old trips, large as well as small. Beyond night and its labrador retriever, the dim tree well up into the star post, outlined in blossoms compressed to silhouettes, almond, olive.  Orchid mourning glory. Chaucer's a love poem. It occurred to me that I should have shown that eight years ago when I wrote the poem. The title is just Chaucer. Into that society Jeffrey Chaucer was born and he died without seeing it return to the way he knew it, partly through his agency.  One can imagine the sight of the peasants drawn up outside the walls of the city, throwing fear into the hearts of King Richard and his nobles, of which Chaucer was one, and barely escaped with his life after the reprisals that followed hard upon the unwillingness of privilege to dispense with his ornaments. Fortunately, Sir John Festall, then a judge in the courts, was a good friend of Chaucer's, where the poet might not have lived to produce the works he did. As it was, of the one hundred twenty projected tales, Chaucer managed to complete only a handful, and it is on these that his reputation rests.  And when a plague, like a guided missile, struck down half of London, it did so by bypassing the city's chief customs inspector. As Chaucer escaped both the plague and the rebellion of the peasants, so I escaped not knowing you, etcetera., etcetera. Leap you. In the language of the spirit, one of the waist high metal ashtrays is on the ground.  Ah, in the lounge of the spirit. I'm always on the verge of waking up in it as that loop is clearly melting into the sky, the sky in the shoe store, as it hills or boats, and the way out where they paint everything turquoise, the night crowded by stars, people drinking everything in sight, a bus taking air from one city river to another, charmed in the glow of not knowing the ending.  The Brooklynese capital, some cannons for Paul Beaudry, the Asia of New England, the parasol bath, the nose brandisher, Xeno's gold, Zoil cookies, the windy fillet.  The ruby throated massage par, the deflector of the night's june, bowling omelets, the beret of age, the whale cartel, the gloom fingered dawn, the critic of peace, winter's decoder, the zabars of Tuscany, mortality's reiterator, Hudson River wife.  The foot wig lock, B's distraction for the armpit, the second basement of composers. I think that's Chopin. I should check. Never been able to check before. I should check. Yes. Wheat tweezing, the light slurper, the weekend divider.  Race's mood ring. Ambition's green monster. The Smega Convention. Hot Carrier of the Arms. Samuel Greenberg. The Mouse that plucked the sea stallion's aimlessness. The Anglophile of Languages. Wisdom's Tourniquet. The Gravy Supper. The Meadow Contable. Tennis Victims. Sewer Court of Ballet.  The Netherlands of Lips, the Mouth Flounder, the Parasitic Trade, Pam and Jerry's, the Pill Pushing Race, the Fisher for Midnight Oil's Cupid, the Cigarette Pyromaniac, the Mosquito Beach, Sunset's Hamburger Extender, the Burgundy's Capitol, the Gatling Gun of Despair, the Tongue Motel.  You mean your follow. Sexual liquid lunch. The game delayer. The nose coup. The escape from sleep. Livium gesso. The shrub settee. The rum runner's luteal slaughter. The penis code. Bookcase stuffing. The deflator of leisure. The barber's friend. The fried egg ditch. The winter manner.  The cough drop West Home, the Hal Newhouser City, the George Washington Carver of Borden, the Schnitzel of the Alps, the Smellway, and two more. Lines. As Falling and Evening, taken together, are the same thing.  The morning air dents a jar of tulips, and interurban affairs are wasted with a dispatch of elegant theory. The empowerment of leaders begins its arduous journey through permanent display, pink, a parade of points, green, turning out products, linking highway to art to meta abrasive. But the free movement through elevated channels causes the scale to fold, the council to abandon.  King Porter's Stump. If I and I are sleeping, and Paul and the baby are sleeping, and the earth is a wheel on a blanket of emeralds held out at arm's length to locate the smell of gardenia and ingenious honeysuckle, if at the precise moment the north light turns, illuminating the wildly creaking carriage against the east wall, showing the litter of boxes of garden.  Unopened presents, five quilts, etcetera. The paint beginning to peel, cold wind rushing past cold insulation and stopped up there over her head. If then I think the fathers of the world are out of their minds, getting up in unison, leaving warm beds and padding on cold feet past the cold bathroom.

I mean, I, you know, but they don't talk about that. You know, they say that the food nearly didn't reach the troops, let alone the humanitarian aid. The food nearly didn't reach them for the next two days. So what you have is all these supplies have to go into, you know, high tech wars require freight. But you could have, I mean, I could have run a news program in here in twenty minutes. I could have produced an absolutely clear, articulate example of what we knew and what we didn't know very clearly. And I said, now go to sleep, people, and wait for something to happen.  You know, it would be the end of the program. And not enough, it wouldn't be enough advertisement really. I mean, but when I left it on more than fifteen minutes, I had to turn it up because I heard this, they were recycling the same bullshit. Now, that's not a glut of information. It's a glut of pseudo information mixed with information. Information, but information is a novelty. It introduces a novelty into the structure, the unexpected. And the unexpected, of course, was the guerrilla war, which opened up on our flank. Although in classical warfare text, they always say, worry about that if you're going to have it.  of a long, single long line. These guys didn't worry about it. In fact, they're afraid to say that it might have been a misjudgment. I notice when the newscasters talk, they say, well, some people might say that it was a misjudgment of the military, but we're not sure. I mean, that's literally what they said. I mean, there's no textbook in military operations that doesn't refer to the dangers of exposing a long flank. I mean, it's ancient military lore. The Chinese knew it, the ancient Chinese knew it, the Indians who played Shatranji knew it. Don't let yourself get exposed on a flank, you can be cut off.  So, I don't know. I mean, in that sense, I think that it takes a good deal of precision and careful thinking to be able to get somewhere. And what I do is think, have mind, will travel. I'll think as well as I can, and I take pleasure in thinking. I take pleasure in trying to figure out what's happening to myself, to the world, and I think that's part of the pleasure of poetry. It's the pleasure of thinking and not locking yourself in. It's not the pleasure of reading an Anthony Hector.  I don't have any terrifying feelings that are terrible, but if you want to write Robert Browning dramatic monologues and update them slightly, that's what you're going to get. It's okay. It has certain dramatic, cynical character that you could say there's a little frisson that it produces at the end usually or somewhere in the middle of it. Great, all right. It's okay. I mean, it doesn't bother me, but I'm interested in that. That's not an artwork from my point of view, or if it is, it's a sort of subsidiary artwork. The School of Iowa produces something like a Diet Coke.  Well, it's a very modestly pleasant drink, you know, that makes your teeth grate because of all the goddamn saccharin. I think we should take a brief break now. Diet coke break, except I'm gonna go back and let's say something like ten minutes. Okay, five minutes after two. For about an hour. Am I answering the questions or am I too aggressive?  Everybody is not quite back. No, no. Well, people will come back eventually. What was the line in the nursery rhyme? Leave them alone and they will come home whacking their tails behind them. Can I catch you? It's nice. It has to look as minimal art. I know it's nice. There's a bunch of material I'm just trying to unload. I'm moving out of town and I just, you're welcome to make a contribution.  I don't know. All right. Would you like me to go? Go ahead. I'm gonna stop now. I do some hyper management. Okay. I was thinking about something you said a little earlier, that information is novelty. And I was thinking of, and something I was talking about was how the how you're talking. The thing I think of is fugue. How you bring up a theme and you develop the theme and then later the themes, maybe they change a little bit or maybe you move them. And I was thinking if you could talk like.  One, kind of how you manage that as you work and what goes on through your head as you do that. Do you think of it in terms of managing themes? I don't now. When I was writing in a more procedural poetry, I actually, in the book called Definitions, the poem called Definitions for Mending was constructed to be a fugue. And it was constructed specifically on the structure, it was built entirely on the structure of a fugue. There's a set of themes.  that come up, one of which was this whole thing called where I took a definition from an insurance book. As I said, my lack of understanding was always one of the things that got to me. And I had been trying to address the loss of a dear friend who died very young, and this is many years later, because I tried it once before and I hadn't been able to do it. And I was living in a corner of the Bronx near the Whitestone Bridge, which had a good library. It mostly was filled with Catholic philosophical texts, which was rather nice because they had the journals of Simone Vale.  I found an insurance manual. I figured they would know what value is. And what loss was. At least they would know what loss was. They might not know what value was. So I found the phrase, I went to him and I found in the insurance book, this loss is an unintentional decline in or disappearance of a value arising from a contingency. And I figured that's fine, but I don't know what a value is. So I went to the dictionary and I found out what a value was. And that comes from the particular dictionary I was looking at. So then I specifically started meditating on them, you know, in a way that you would by playing them.  The themes in relation to each other. You know, the term fugue is a metaphor, but there was something like my interest in what they call the Stretto, that is the bringing together, tightening of the distances between narrowing the distances between the materials between one theme and another. You narrow the harmonic distance and play them closer and closer.

Was any of this present, and how could this be, the magic solution of what you are in now, whatever has held you motionless, like this, so long through the dark season, until now the women come out in navy blue, and the worms come out of the compost to die, it is the end of any season, you reading there so accurately, sitting not wanting to be disturbed, as you came from that holy land, what other signs of earth's dependency were upon you, what fixed signs were upon you?  at the crossroads, what lethargy in the avenues, where all is said in a whisper. What tone of voice among the hedges, what tone under the apple trees? The numbered land stretches away, and your house is built in tomorrow, but surely not before the examination of what is right and will befall, not before the census and the writing down of names. Remember you are free to wander away, as from other times, other scenes that were taking place, the history of someone who came too late. The time is ripe now, and the adage is hatching, as the seasons change and tremble. It is finally as though that thing of  monstrous interest were happening in the sky, but the sun is setting and prevents you from seeing it. Out of night the token emerges, its leaves like birds alighting all at once under a tree, taken up and shaken again, put down in weak rage, knowing as the brain does, it can never come about, not here, not yesterday in the past, only in the gap of today filling itself, as emptiness is distributed in the idea of what time it is, when that time is already past. Scheherazade. Unsupported by reasons.  Enigma, water collects in squared stone catch basins. The land is dry. Under it moves the water. Fish live in the wells. The leaves, a concerned green, are scrawled on the light. Bad bindweed and rank ragweed somehow forget to flourish here. An inexhaustible wardrobe has been placed at the disposal of each new occurrence. It can be itself now. Day is almost reluctant to decline, and slowing down opens out new avenues, that don't infringe on space, but are living here with us. Other dreams came and left, while a bank of colored verbs  adjectives was shrinking from the light, to nurse in shade their want of a method. But most of all she loved the particles, the transform objects of the same category into particular ones, each distinct within and apart from its own class. In all this springing up was no hint of a tide, only a pleasant wavering of the air, in which all things seemed present, whether just past or soon to come. It was all invitation. So much the flowers outlined along the night, alleys when few were visible, yet their stories sounded louder than the hum of bug and stick noises that brought up the rear,  trundling it along into a new fact of day. These were meant to be read as any salutation before getting down to business. But they stuck to their guns, and so much was their obstinacy in keeping with the rest, like long flashes of white birds that refuse to die when day does, that none knew the warp which presented this major movement, as a firm digression, a plane that slowly becomes a mountain. So each found himself caught in a net, as a fashion, and all efforts to wriggle free involved him further, inexorably, since all existed there to be told, shot through from border to border,  Here were stones that read as patches of sunlight. There was the story of the grandparents, of the vigorous young champion, the lines once given to another, now restored to the new speaker. Dinners and assemblies, the light in the old home, the secret way the rooms fed into each other, but all was wariness of time watching itself, for nothing in the complex story grew outside. The greatness in the moment of telling stayed unresolved until its wealth of incident, pain mixed with pleasure, faded in the precise moment of bursting into bloom, its growth ecstatic lament.  Some stories survived the dynasty of the builders, but their echo was itself locked in, became anticipation that was only memory, after all, for the possibilities are limited. It is seen at the end that the kind and good are rewarded, that the unjust one is doomed to burn forever around his error, sadder and wiser anyway. Between these extremes, the others muddle through, like us, uncertain, but wearing artlessly their function of minor characters who must be kept in mind. It is we who make this jungle and call it space, naming each root.  each serpent for the sound of the name as it clinks dully against our pleasure, indifference that is pleasure. And what would they be without an audience to restrict the innumerable passes and swipes, restored to good humour as it issues into the impervious evening air? So, in some way, although the arithmetic is incorrect, the balance is restored because it balances, knowing it prevails, and the man who made the same mistake twice is exonerated. The Tomb of Stuart Merrill. Stuart Merrill, incidentally, was a  a nineteenth century American poet who emigrated to France and became one of the French symbolist poets. It is the first soir of March. They have taken the plants away. Martha Hoopel wanted a big Gnossienne hydrangea smelling all over of jicky for her card party. The basement couldn't hold up all that wildness. The petits fours have left. Then up and spake the major. The new conservatism is sitting down beside you. Once when the bus slid out past Place  I caught the lens cover reflection. Lilacs won't make much difference, it said. Otherwise, in Paris, why, you never approve much of my pet remedies. I spoke once of a palliative for piles you wouldn't try or admit to trying any other. Now we live without, or rather we get along without each other. Each of us does live within that conundrum we don't call living, both shut up and open. Can knowledge ever be harmful? How about a mandate? I think of throwing myself on the mercy of the court.

But you can't do that. He hasn't even finished his spinach, urged the Sea Hag, looking fearfully around at the apartment. But Olive was already out of earshot. Now the apartment succumbed to a strange new hush. Actually, it's quite pleasant here, thought the Sea Hag. If this is all we need fear from spinach, then I don't mind so much. Perhaps we could invite Alice the Goon over. She scratched one dug pensively. But Wimpey is such a country.  Bumpkin always burping like that. Minute at first, the thunder soon filled the apartment. It was domestic thunder, the color of spinach. Popeye chuckled and scratched his balls. It sure was pleasant to spend a day in the country. This next poem must date from about nineteen seventy four, when I at last could no longer escape teaching and began teaching poetry to students at Brooklyn College, and found myself immediately assailed by their questions about what is poetry and why is this a poem?  Why do you say this isn't? And what is poetry anyway? And so this is called What Is Poetry, but the title has no question mark. And I don't think it was probably very helpful to the students, but it was part of my finally beginning to think about what is poetry myself, having done it for a long time without ever having asked myself that question. And it ends as so many of my poems do, or rather they include lines of bits of conversation overheard very often when walking on the streets in New York, where you hear rather peculiar things sometimes.  What is poetry? The medieval town with frieze of boy scouts from Nagoya. The snow that came when we wanted it to snow. Beautiful images. Trying to avoid ideas as in this poem. But we go back to them as to a wife leaving the mistress we desire. Now they will have to believe it as we believe it. In school all the thought got combed out. What was left was like a field. Shut your eyes and you can feel it for miles.  Now open them on a thin vertical path. It might give us what, some flowers soon? It's the last line. It might give us what, some flowers soon that I overheard a boy saying to a girl in Brentano's bookshop in New York and decided to keep it. The next one at North Farm was written in the early eighties and although North Farm obviously could be anywhere and I don't explain it.  in the poem what suggested it. It's actually the name given in the translation I read of the Kalevala, the Finnish folk epic of a place called I think it's Pohjola, I don't know how the Finnish pronunciation, a place described as being near hell but not exactly in it and always with the epithet gloomy and prosperous North Farm. At North Farm, somewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you at incredible speed, traveling day and night through blizzards and desert heat, across torrents, through narrow paths.  But will he know where to find you, recognize you when he sees you, give you the thing he has for you? Hardly anything grows here, yet the granaries are bursting with meal, the sacks of meal piled to the rafters, the streams run with sweetness, fattening fish, birds darken the sky. Is it enough that the dish of milk is set out at night, that we think of him sometimes, sometimes and always, with mixed feelings? Well, this is a fairly recent poem of the past few years.  I don't know exactly when. At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it. And I can't think of anything I was thinking about when I wrote it, so I won't introduce it except I see it has the phrase The Unruly Son, obviously, a theft from John Dunn. At first I thought I wouldn't say anything about it. But then I thought keeping quiet about it might appear even ruder. At first I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  The unruly son informed me otherwise. I am in my heavy set pants and find this occupation of beekeeper charming, though I have yet to meet my first bee. We don't know if I get to keep the hat and veil. Too hot, he said, too hot for everything. He's so caring, so mundane. To have you on board. Bulgarian choirs everywhere stood up and sang the song of the rent. It was lovely. Now I shall take a short vacation, proof that I am needed here. Nobody wants my two cents anymore, I believe.  To some, it was like skating in summer. A small turret perched over the lake. It exploded. That's the way I feel about people taking me out to some nice repast. And afterwards, you go home and go over everything that was stated. I prefer flowers and breathing. The next poem is called No Longer Very Clear. Well, it's no longer very clear to me when I wrote it or what I was thinking about when I wrote it. However, I could tell you that the public radio station in New York City, WNYC.  had a benefit concert, and they asked me to contribute a poem which would be set to music by a number of contemporary composers, or at any rate they would write music suggested by it if they weren't actually setting the words. And Philip Glass, Morton Gould, Tanya Leon were among the composers. One of them was the composer Joan Tower, who is actually a friend of mine and colleague at Bard College, where she teaches. And she took two of the lines and wrote piano pieces.  She says are based on them and she's going to do another one to make three, but she hasn't done it yet.
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83	0.0	390.93	 It took much longer than any other poetry that I've ever written. The three poems were written over a period of about a year and a half, maybe. I didn't quite know what I wanted to do. I thought it would be interesting to write poetic prose that wasn't poetic, in other words, a prose poem that really drew on the resources of prosiness as well as poetic sounding language. And indeed, I tried to get as many different tones of writing and voice as possible. So I guess I fairly early on imagined this work as being kind of three.  Large oblong boxes that I was going to have to fill with something, and I didn't really know what that was going to be. And that's frequently the case when I begin writing, I can sort of see the shape of the poem, but it's just an empty outline and no idea what I'm going to end up. This is a passage from the system, from one of the three poems in the book, three poems.  I know now that I am no longer waiting, and that the previous part of my life in which I thought I was waiting, and therefore only half alive, was not waiting, although it was tinged with expectancy, but living under and into this reply which has suddenly caused everything in my world to take on a new meaning. It is as though I had picked up a thread which I had merely mislaid, but which for a long time seemed lost, and all because I am certain now, albeit for no very good reason, that it was this one and no other. The sadness that infected us as children, and stayed on through adulthood, has healed, and there can be no other way except this way of health we are taking.  silent as it is, but it lets us look back on those other seemingly spoiled days and reevaluate them. Actually, they were too well rounded, each bore its share of happiness and grief, and finished its tale just as twilight was descending. Those days are now an inseparable part of our story, despite their air of immaturity and tentativeness. They have the freshness of early works, which may be wrongly discarded later. Nor is today really any different. We are as childish as ever, it turns out, only perhaps a little better at disguising it, but we still want what we want when we want it, and no power on earth is stronger than it.  strong enough to deny it to us. But at least we see now that this is how things are, and so we have the sense to stop insisting every so often, under the guise of some apparently unrelated activity, because we think we shall be better satisfied this way. Underneath the discreet behavior, the desire is as imperious as ever. But after so many postponements, we now realize that a little delay won't hurt, and we can relax in the assurance of eventual satisfaction. This was the message of that day in the street, when you first perceived that conventional happiness would not do for you, and decided to opt for the erratic kind, despite the dangers that it's needed.  for continual growth and expansion exposed it to. This started you on your way, although it often seemed as though your feet had struck roots into the ground and you were doomed to grow and decay like a tree. Nevertheless, you were aware of moving, whether it was you who were moving or the landscape moving forward toward you, and you could remain patient with the idea of growth as long as the concept of uniqueness, that one and no other, shone like a star in the sky above you. John Ashbury, reading a passage from  The system from his book Three Poems. For the reader of Ashbury's work, one initial obstacle is overcoming the expectation of a literal sequential understanding. Well, it seems I think people bring this expectation to almost any poetry and are destined to be disappointed since I don't think this condition is unique to me by any chance but applies to almost any poetry that I can think of. It's impossible to have a completely expository poem.  in mind, and then sit down and write it, and it will be exactly as it was conceived. All kinds of strange things happen while one is writing, which deflect the original intent. And my own work, I guess, is just an extreme example of letting this happen. To me, it seems more truthful since it's a more complete reflection of my thought while I'm writing.  In nineteen seventy eight, composer Eliot Carter wrote an unusual work titled Syringa for mezzo soprano, bass and chamber ensemble. The bass sings a collection of Greek texts on the legend of Orpheus, while the mezzo soprano simultaneously sings John Ashbury's poem called Syringa. The myth of Orpheus is that of the legendary singer who brings his beloved Eurydice back from death, an allegory about the presumed power of music and poetry to turn time back and stop.  Irretrievable loss. Even before Syringa, Ashbury had long admired Carter. What is it about Carter's music that the poet finds so sympathetic to his work? Well, the fact I guess that it's so complex and yet so clear at the same time. Why should that be good? Well, because I think it reflects experience much more accurately.

For instance, he'll describe the reflection of a pin on an apple, the shadow of a pin on an apple. That got me interested. But what set you to translate him? I mean, was it I know there were some of your translations in Evergreen Review about nineteen sixty two or something like that. Was that on the occasion of Reverend D. died in nineteen sixty, didn't he? sixty, yes. Did that occasion those translations?  I don't remember, but the Mercure de France was interested in I used to know an editor there, Maurice Sallier, and I remember discussing with him how poets in New York, namely Kenneth Coke and Frank O'Hara, were very, very enamored of Rouvier D. He was very interested in this and asked us to write something about him for the Mercure de France, which I believe I did.  I think did. And did the translations, though, come about at that same time, or had you done a number of them for the anthology earlier? Yeah, that was around the same time. I forget exactly why I sent them to Evergreen Review, which took forever to publish them, and I heard didn't really want to. Really? Well, somebody said that they had been in the office.  And evergreen, and my RevoD translations had been spiked, as they say, in offices with other papers file and forget. And somebody had written boring on them. And it was several years after they accepted them that they published. But at that time, they were publishing mainly beat literature, which would be the opposite pole from RevoD. And how about the work of Maksha Kob?  I'm interested in that. I don't remember. I think probably it was Kenneth, whom all blessings, who introduced me, but I really can't remember. It was so long ago, I think I can't remember a time when I didn't read his work. Was it particularly the Cornea Day that? Yeah. And the one about the colony in Brazil, do you remember what the title of that is? In the Cornea Day? Yeah.  I remember the one about Meister Eckhardt, a wonderful poem of his. Yes. And while you were living in France, you'd actually stayed in France, it was mentioned that how you had done some work to supplement your income, you'd done some translation work. I remember seeing a book, I can't remember the author now, but it was a book on Melville by a French writer, and it was published by Grove Press here in your translation. Am I right about that? Was that assigned to you?  signed by Grove Press. And I didn't particularly like the book. So I won't reveal the author's name. He was a professor at the Sorbonne. In fact, I can't remember his name at the moment. I could, probably. But Grove offered me, I think, one hundred fifty dollars to translate this book, which was wonderful if he didn't have any money. And so I made an appointment to see the author, hoping that he would give me his notes.  especially the sources of all the quotations from Melville that were in the book. And he said, Oh, I don't keep any notes. I said, Well, I can't translate Melville into my own English. So I ended up having to buy all of Melville's books, which weren't that easy to find, some of them in Paris at that time. And then flipping through them desperately searching for half of a sentence. It was terrible. Sounds like you lost money on the deal.  And you did a number of sort of police novels, crime novels as well? Two, yes. Oh. That was for Edition Dietice. Did you ever hear of that? That was No, it was Jamaica. A guy named Frederic Dietice, they published mainly trash. And one of them was called The Sex Le Plus. I forget what the word was, but I translated The Deadlier Sex, which was about women.  Of course. And I think that's the title that was chosen. And the other one was that was by a woman writer named Genevieve Montserrand, whom I'm sure is a name that won't ring any bells either. And the other one was by a writer named Noel Vexin, it's called Champagne Obligatoire. And it was about gangster run nightclubs in Montmartre. And in those places, if you were so unlucky as to go into one.  You were forced to buy champagne. It was terrible champagne, but on the menu would read Champagne obligatoire. And so I translated a compulsory champagne, which I thought was a nice title, but they changed that at Dell to Murder in Montmartre. And actually, I think I got about one hundred fifty dollars for each of those, and I never knew whether they were published or not. Some reason I contacted.  GTS actually was a French friend who then moved to New York and I lost touch with him. And so when my friend David Karmani was compiling a bibliography of me a number of years ago.

Can't have it and this makes me angry. I shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of Avignon on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge. I shall see I shall at last see my complete face reflected not in the water but in the worn stone floor of my bridge. I shall keep to myself. I shall not repeat others' comments about me.  Thank you. Portrait. Well, these are by another guy named John. He was always the first in the class, Ashbury, and I was always the last. Yeah. Portrait, or is it a poor trait? I am a parasite. I lift off the wings of others.  It was cast by the burning of the House of Lords and Commons, eighteen thirty five, by JMW Turner. It's in three parts. At one point in the story, the rain was green and the sky was pink shot through with painfully streaks of mauve and gray. Everyone, including the servants and maids, went onto the veranda and began applauding. It wasn't yet evening. Even those who were on the outside of the narrative, those like us who had no place in the story, were invited to attend this momentous event.  Along the river banks, the fulsome reflections of flowers blossomed in every imaginable hue. Some colors floated slowly toward the sky, like boats ferrying the dead to their destination. Twisted mazes of sparks led the way. It was a celebration, an announcement of dread and joy. We were lost within a swirling storm of seraphic color dripping with the revelations the sky had flung in our faces. That's when it came to our attention that the palace was on fire, but no one dared cross the river and approach its gates.  This was a different story. Its narrative promising that the construction and destruction of civil order would occur naturally, like the weather or the flags flying within it. This is the story none of us were invited to attend unless we already had taken up residence in its chapters, with its stained pages rising toward the fiery ceiling the architect had told them would be blue forever. This is the story that did not invite intervention. two. Just as there are two paintings with many witnesses huddled on the far shore.  There are at least two stories in those who weren't invited to listen to them. This story happened before we met. No one but us remembers it now. Two shadows standing beneath a stone arch, a dark river flowing past. What does it mean to be alone with each other, sharing memories no one else has? Or perhaps this is the story that cannot be addressed, the one that started with and without our consent, the one we are still telling, the one in which we become honorary citizens of a city not yet named. Inhabitants of a small city, a hovel.  As it is, we are spoonfuls of ashes scattered among the day's abominations. We'll never be sure how our voices intersected amidst the pillars constantly being erected for and against prismatic densities by which one is supposed to swear lifelong allegiance. Such alliances seem based on a different astrology than the one guiding us through the night. There is another set of stars in the sky, and we don't know their names or their purpose. That is what is pulling us across the burning lake.  which one of us later told the other, or dreamed of telling the other, as the difference between these two types of flying having dissolved long ago. Each of us lay there thinking, I wish I could say something about the future that will come true. A room, each of us, this is the third section last. A room each of us wanted to erect a story or shelter against the wind that untethered us from everything we tried to hold onto, from concrete notes to abstract ideas. Each of us needed that shaded plateau, that place where centuries were.  On the small shells on which we pretended to sleep, when vast constellations of villainous orthography prowled the land looking for components to evaporate into bursts of fiery laughter, we realized the world was porous and that we were handfuls of sand trickling through its openings into the sea waiting below. How to hold onto ourselves and each other without threatening the seedlings beneath the skin. In the beginning, we told ourselves there was an exit somewhere for us to begin making up what had never happened.  In all likelihood, never would. Later we told each other, in one way or another, that there was a window with a view of paradise. We silently agreed that the window doesn't open because it was never there, but that the shadows of its imprint could be seen on the opposite wall. Some days we sit facing them, trying to decipher their promises, but more often than not, we look the other way, still believing that there's something else.

All of our lives is a rebus of little wooden animals painted shy, terrific colors, magnificent and horrible, close together. The message is learned the way light at the edge of a beach in autumn is learned. The seasons are superimposed. In New York, we have winter in August, as they do in Argentina and Australia. Spring is leafy and cold, autumn pale and dry. And changes build up forever, like birds released into the light of an August sky, falling away forever.  to define the handful of things we know for sure, followed by musical evenings. Yes, friends, these clouds pulled along on invisible ropes are, as you have guessed, merely stage machinery. And the funny thing is, it knows we know about it and still wants us to go on believing in what it so unskilfully imitates and wants to be loved not for that but for itself. The murky atmosphere of a park, tattered foliage, wise old tree trunks, rainbow tissue paper, wadded clouds down near where the perspective is.  intersects the sunset, so we may know we, too, are somehow impossible, formed of so many different things, too many to make sense to anybody. We straggle on as quotients, hard to combine ingredients, and what continues does so with our participation and consent. Try milk of tears, but it is not the same. The dandelions will have to know why, and your comic dirge routine will be lost on the unfolding sheaves of the wind, a lucky one, though it will carry you too far to some manageable, cold, open.  Shore of sorrows you expected to reach, then leave behind. Thus, friend, this distilled, dispersed musk of moving around, the product of leaf after transparent leaf, of too many comings and goings, visitors at all hours, each night is trifoliate, strange to the touch.  It's called wet casements, prefaced by the first sentence of Kafka's story, Wedding Preparations in the Country, which is, When Edward Raban, coming along the passage, walked into the open doorway, he saw that it was raining. It was not raining much. The conception is interesting to see as though reflected in streaming window panes, the look of others through their own eyes, a digest of their correct impressions, of their self analytical attitudes, overlaid by digestion.  Your ghostly, transparent face, you and Falbalas of some distant but not too distant era, the cosmetics, the shoes perfectly pointed, drifting how long you have been drifting, how long I have too for that matter, like a bottle imp toward a surface which can never be approached, never pierced through into the timeless energy of a present which would have its own opinions on these matters, are an epistemological snapshot of the processes that first mentioned your name at some crowded cocktail party long ago.  The person addressed overheard it and carried that name around in his wallet for years as the wallet crumbled and bills slid in and out of it. I want that information very much today, can't have it, and this makes me angry. I shall use my anger to build a bridge like that of Avignon on which people may dance for the feeling of dancing on a bridge. I shall at last see my complete face reflected not in the water but in the worn stone floor of my bridge. I shall keep to myself. I shall not repeat others' comments about me.  Read about two or three more. This one is called Pyrography, which refers to the wood burning kit you probably had or I did anyway when I was a child making pictures on wood with an electric needle. Out here on Cottage Grove, it matters. The galloping wind bulks at its shadow. The carriages are drawn forward under a sky of fumed oil.  This is America calling, the mirroring of state to state, of voice to voice on the wires, the force of colloquial greetings, like golden pollen sinking on the afternoon breeze. In service stairs, the sweet corruption thrives. The page of dusk turns like a creaking, revolving stage in Warren, Ohio. If this is the way it is, let's leave, they agree. And soon the slow boxcar journey begins, gradually accelerating until the gyrating fan of suburbs, enfolding the darkness of cities, are remembered.  Only as a recurring tick. And midway, we meet the disappointed returning ones without its being able to stop us in the headlong night toward the nothing of the coast. At Bolinas, the houses doze and seem to wonder why through the Pacific haze and the dreams alternately glow and grow dull. Why be hanging on here like kites circling, slipping on a ramp of air, but always circling? But the variable cloudiness is pouring it on, flooding back to you like the meaning of a joke. The land wasn't immediately appealing.  partly over with fake ruins in the image of ourselves, an arch that terminates in mid keystone, a crumbling stone pier for laundresses, an open air theater never completed and only partially designed. How are we to inhabit this space from which the fourth wall is invariably missing, as in a stage set or dollhouse, except by staying as we are in lost profile, facing the stars, with dozens of as yet unrealized projects and a strict sense of time running out, of evening presenting the tactfully folded over bed.  And we fit rather too easily into it, become transparent, almost ghosts. One day the birds and animals in the pasture have absorbed the color, the density of the surroundings, the leaves are alive and too heavy with life. A long period of adjustment followed. In the cities, at the turn of the century, they knew about it.

The light bounces off mossy rocks down to me in this glen, the neat villa, which when he'd had he would not had he of, and jests smouting of privet, which on hot spring nights perfumes the empty rooms with the smell of sperm flushed down toilets, on hot summer afternoons within sight of the sea.

But he's got to be released by giants from things. And as the plant grows older, it realizes it will never be a tree, will probably always be haunted by a bee, and cultivate stupid impressions so as not to become part of the dirt. The dirt is mounting like a sea. And we say goodbye, shaking hands in front of the crashing of the waves that give our words lonesomeness, and make those flabby hands seem ours, hands that are always writing things on mirrors for people to see later.

It remains for me to get better, and to understand you so, like a chair sized man. Boots were heard on the floor above. In the garden the sunlight was still purple, but what buzzed in it had changed slightly, but not forever. But casting its shadow on sticks, and looking around for an opening in the air, was quite as if it had never refused to exist differently. Guys in the yard handled the belt he had made.

You would not let me out for two days and three nights, bringing me books bound in wild thyme and scented wild grasses, as if reading had any interest for me, you. Now you are laughing. Darkness interrupts my story. Turn on the light.  What am I going to do? I am growing up again, in school. The crisis will be very soon. And you twist the darkness in your fingers, you who are slightly older. Who are you, anyway? And it is the color of sand, the darkness, as it sifts through your hand. Because what does anything mean?

The line in this poem about the unassassinated president does not have any relation to the assassination of President Kennedy since the poem was written two years before that. Rivers and mountains.

Certainly squirrels lived in the woods, but devastation and dull sleep still hung over the land, quelled the rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons, singing on marble factory walls, deaf consolation of minor tunes that packed the air with heavy invisible rods, pent in some sand valley from which only quiet walking ever instructs. The bird flew over and sat there was nothing else to do.

It is finally as though that thing of monstrous interest were happening in the sky, but the sun is setting and prevents you from seeing it. Out of night the token emerges, its leaves like birds alighting all at once under a tree, taken up and shaken again, put down in weak rage, knowing as the brain does, it can never come about, not here, not yesterday in the past, only in the gap of today filling itself, as emptiness is  distributed in the idea of what time it is, when that time is already past. Scheherazade Unsupported by reason's enigma, water collects in squared stone catch basins. The land is dry, under it moves the water. Fish live in the wells. The leaves, a concerned green, are sprawled on the light. Bad bindweed and rank ragweed somehow forget to flourish here. An inexhaustible wardrobe has been placed at the disposal of each new occurrence. It can be itself now.  almost reluctant to decline, and slowing down opens out new avenues that don't infringe on space, but are living here with us. Other dreams came and left, while the bank of coloured verbs and adjectives was shrinking from the light, to nurse in shade their want of a method. But most of all she loved the particles, the transform objects of the same category into particular ones, each distinct within and apart from its own class. In all this springing up was no hint of a tide, only a pleasant wavering of the air, in which all things seemed present, whether just past,  or soon to come. It was all invitation. So much the flowers outlined along the night, alleys when few were visible, yet their stories sounded louder than the hum of bug and stick noises that brought up the rear, trundling it along into a new fact of day. These were meant to be read as any salutation before getting down to business, but they stuck to their guns, and so much was their obstinacy in keeping with the rest, like long flashes of white birds that refuse to die when day does, that none knew the warp which presented this major movement as a firm digression, a plane that slowly becomes a  So each found himself caught in a net, as a fashion, and all efforts to wriggle free involved him further, inexorably, since all existed there to be told, shot through from border to border. Here were stones that read as patches of sunlight, there was the story of the grandparents, of the vigorous young champion, the lines once given to another, now restored to the new speaker, dinners and assemblies, the light in the old home, the secret way the rooms fed into each other, but all was weariness of time watching itself, for nothing in the complex story grew outside.  The greatness in the moment of telling stayed unresolved until its wealth of incident, pain mixed with pleasure, faded in the precise moment of bursting into bloom, its growth of static lament. Some stories survived the dynasty of the builders, but their echo was itself locked in, became anticipation that was only memory after all, for the possibilities are limited. It is seen at the end that the kind and good are rewarded, that the unjust one is doomed to burn forever around his error, sadder and wiser.  Anyway. Between these extremes, the others muddle through, like us, uncertain, but wearing artlessly their function of minor characters who must be kept in mind. It is we who make this jungle and call it space, naming each root, each serpent, for the sound of the name as it clinks dully against our pleasure, indifference that is pleasure. And what would they be without an audience to restrict the innumerable passes and swipes, restored to good humour as it issues into the impervious evening air?

I think of throwing myself on the mercy of the court. They are bringing the plants back, one by one, in the interstices of heaven, earth, and to day. I have become attracted to your style. You seem to possess within your work an air of total freedom of expression and imagery, somewhat interesting and puzzling. After I read one of your poems, I am always tempted to read and reread it. It seems that my inexperience holds me back from understanding your meanings.  what it is you do to magnetize your poetry, where the curious reader, always a bit puzzled, comes back for a clearer insight. The canons are falling one by one, including Le Celebre of Paco Belle, the final movement of Franc's sonata for piano and violin. How about a new kind of hermetic conservatism, and suffering withdrawal symptoms of sane? Let's get on with it, but what about the past? Because it only builds up out of fragments.

There is an interest in watching how one piece is added to another,  At least it isn't horrible, like being inside a hospital and really finding out what it's like in there.

But it's yours, R said. It was mine, the woman said, but now I'm finished with it. I came here today to give it to you. seven. Twelve years ago, my wife's sister went off to live in Taiwan. Her intention was to study Chinese, which she now speaks with breathtaking fluency, and to support herself by giving English lessons to native Chinese speakers in Taipei. That was approximately one year before I met my wife, who was then a graduate student.  Columbia University. One day, my future sister in law was talking to an American friend, a young woman who had also gone to Taipei to study Chinese. The conversation came around to the subject of their families back home, which in turn led to the following exchange. I have a sister who lives in New York, my future sister in law said. So do I, her friend answered. My sister lives on the Upper West Side. So does mine. My sister lives on West one hundred ninth Street. Believe it or not, so does mine. My sister lives at three hundred nine West one hundred ninth Street.  So does mine. My sister lives on the second floor of three hundred and nine West one hundred and ninth Street. The friend took a deep breath and said, I know this sounds crazy, but so does mine. It is scarcely possible for two cities to be farther apart than Taipei and New York. They are at opposite ends of the earth, separated by a distance of more than ten thousand miles. And when it is day in one, it is night in the other. As the two young women in Taipei marveled over the astounding connection they had just uncovered, they realized that their two sisters were probably asleep at that moment on the same floor of the same building.  in northern Manhattan, each one was sleeping in her own apartment, unaware of the conversation that was taking place about them on the other side of the world. Although they were neighbors, it turned out that the two sisters in New York did not know each other. When they finally met, two years later, neither one of them was living in that building anymore. Siri and I were married then. One evening, on our way to an appointment somewhere, we happened to stop in at a bookstore on Broadway to browse for a few minutes. We must have wandered into different aisles. And because I and because Siri wanted to show me something, or because I wanted to show her something.  I can't remember. One of us spoke the other's name out loud. A second later, a woman came rushing up to us. You're Paul Oster and Siri Hustved, aren't you? she said. Yes, we said, that's exactly who we are. How did you know that? The woman then explained that her sister and Siri's sister had been students together in Taiwan. The circle had been closed at last. Since that evening in the bookstore ten years ago, this woman has been one of our best and most loyal friends. eight. Three summers ago, a letter turned up in my mailbox.

Various post office markings were stamped across the front. Not deliverable. Unable to forward. Return to writer. mister Morgan's name had been crossed out with a pen, and beside it someone had written, Not at this address. Drawn in the same blue ink, an arrow pointed to the upper left hand corner of the envelope, accompanied by the words, Return to sender. Assuming that the post office had made a mistake, I checked the upper left hand corner to see who the sender was. There, to my absolute bewilderment.  I discovered my own name and my own address. Not only that, but this information was printed on a custom made address label, one of those labels you can order in packs of two hundred from advertisements on matchbook covers. The spelling of my name was correct. The address was my address, and yet the fact was, and still is, that I have never owned or ordered a set of printed address labels in my life. Inside, there was a single space typewritten letter that began Dear Robert, in response to your letter dated july fifteenth, nineteen eighty nine, I can only say that, like other authors, I often received a letter.  receive letters concerning my work. Then, in a bombastic, pretentious style, riddled with quotations from French philosophers, and oozing with a tone of conceit and self satisfaction, the letter writer went on to praise Robert for the ideas he had developed about one of my books in a college course on the contemporary novel. It was a contemptible letter, the kind of letter I would never dream of writing to anyone, and yet it was signed with my name. The handwriting did not resemble mine, but that was small comfort. Someone was out there trying to impersonate me, and as far as I know, he still is.  One friend suggested that this was an example of mail art. Knowing that the letter could not be delivered to Robert Morgan, since there was no such person, the author of the letter was actually addressing his remarks to me. But that would imply an unwarranted faith in the US Postal Service. And I doubt that someone who would go to the trouble of ordering address labels in my name and then sitting down to write such an arrogant, high flown letter would leave anything to chance. Or would he? Perhaps the smart aleks of this world believe that everything will always go their way. I have scant hope of ever getting to the bottom of this little mystery.  did a good job of covering his tracks, and he has not been heard from since. What puzzles me about my own behavior is that I have not thrown away the letter, even though it continues to give me chills every time I look at it.

Mary Reinholdt Roberts in nineteen twenty wrote a novel entitled The Bat, which would have faded entirely into obscurity if Bob Cain hadn't watched the movie version of the book and invented his response character, Batman.

The editor was emphatic. The editor laughed grimly. The editor smiled. His companion rose as well, but it was evident that the editor's theory had taken firm hold on his mind. The editor paused in the doorway. Well? said the editor. You won't let it go any further.  Reticently good looking, and well, if inconspicuously clothed and groomed, he by no means seemed the typical detective that the editor had spoken of so scornfully.

In the nineteen sixties, starting in nineteen sixty three, Roy Lichtenstein did a series of paintings by which he appropriated frames out of comic books.  Comic books, painted those comic book frames in monumental scale and often would have thought balloons and speech bubbles embedded in these paintings.

Shirley makes a face and signs, What's that smell? Janice signs back, Incense. Shirley gave a high pitched scream when she was upset. I heard it often, invariably directed at Janice's father or Elka, his Hungarian mother who lived down the street and who tried to rule their lives. Elka's the only reason Janice and Sharon shared a double bed. When the twin beds Shirley had ordered arrived, Elka appeared and told the deliveryman to take them back. Sisters sleep together, that's the Hungarian way. And there was nothing Shirley could do.  As soon as Janice could form a sentence, she became the family translator. Nine years old called in from jumpscoping. Nine years old called in from jump roping to explain the leaky faucet to the plumber, to negotiate with the insurance agent, to tell Elka no while Shirley screamed in the background. Elka was intense. One time I was at her house when the toilet clogged, and she rolled up her sleeve and stuck her arm in and unwedged the shit with her hand. She'd been in the States like forty years, but never adapted. Her English was broken, and when she rode in a car, she'd sitting there.  on the back seat, white knuckling the door handle and saying slower, slower. Outside it was so cold this knot and your nose froze. Elka scolded Janice and Sharon for leaving the house. Dashikas Azutsa, she'd shout. The streets are icy. It was her catchphrase, like go ahead, make my day was for Clint Eastwood. Dashikas Azutsa. She said it so often, Sharon and John spray painted it across the garage door. Lying on Janice's bed smoking a joint, one of us randomly shouts Dashikas.  Laugh until spittle flies out of our mouths. We had no idea if the crystals on John's windshield were real or if we were hallucinating them. John had just started computer school in Chicago. He was all excited about it, said computers were the wave of the future, that within our lifetimes cash money was going to be obsolete, and all money transactions would be done with computers. They'd just introduced major credit cards, and whenever you'd use your card, the clerk would have to make sure your card wasn't bad by pulling out a booklet with thousands of dollars.  of bad credit card numbers listed in teeny type, and everybody in line would shuffle impatiently while the clerk looked through the booklet to see if your card was listed there. It took forever. So we scoffed at John's foolishness. But of course, John's real foolishness was dropping out of computer school after six months, because he would have gotten in on the ground floor and he'd be rich. I wonder what he looks like now, is he pot bellied, balding, with a chain smoker's cough, sitting in front of his home entertainment center, drinking beer after beer, feeling like a loser. He was so handsome, a hothead and a loud mouth to be sure.  Affection was uncomplicated. You could count on it. Janice and I both loved him, though we never would have admitted it. That hasn't changed for me. When I love people, I hide it like a cat hides its illness, as if my love were a dirty little secret. I might love you, for instance, and you never even know it. I didn't think much about the future in those days. I wanted things to stay the way they were forever. To be a college student living away from home, check for my parents arriving at the beginning of each month.  I studied hard, aced my courses, got stone nights and weekends. Nothing could be better than that. My biggest fear for my future was that at some unimaginably distant point, like when I was eighty maybe, I turned into a person who no longer took LSD. Some horrible old robot all dried up and old and efficient. What if I woke up into a twenty first century world without magic? I longed to look in the mirror and see that nineteen year old self standing behind me, sweaty and musky, long strawberry hair parted down the middle, pupils dilated, fingers dilated.  I smile at her and say, I'm not so bad. I write books, I go to coffee houses, I give readings. She flashes on my sex life and rolls her green stoned eyes. She can see everything, my sobriety, my reserve, how when I get home the first thing I do is head for the kitchen and wash my hands, as if to shake the world from my fingers. I say, I have a pink chenille bathrobe just like you, even though they're near impossible to find in two thousand nine. I make raw almond milk twice a week. You haven't tripped since nineteen eighty one, she says.  Scrunching up her face and jetting out her lower lip like Doris Day about to blow her bangs sky high. Sharon was tall and thin with large eyes and lips.

Strong hat waves, waves motorcycles have anti ravaged, the western basins of the great continental chain. Into pitch darkness the stairs twisted and, top back all one hundred lights, red filters, bobbing high above what I suppose light fog to be. And cold. You don't have any punctuation, but of course it was there when you read. The punctuation was very emphatic. And I just wondered whether what?  Why that is. Well, the thing is, I think I'm sort of when I read it, I feel like I have to improvise it, almost like I have to make it up, and I might read it another time, and the punctuation might be completely different, because most of those lines are linking both forward and back, and so you have to decide when you're reading it to close it at a certain point and then reopen it. But I think all those things are fairly are variable, or a lot of them are. So I can be interrupted at any moment.  The books, yeah, can browse out from there. There's a couple going around here. And so for me, this book is a lot of the writing that I've been doing in the last couple years. So a little bit before then. And I want to read three poems now. She fall down and go boom. The bridge seems too far down to take it. I can't take it. My mind is going. The funeral is so different.  We all go out to dinner and leave her. The corner of the house. A license plate with a word spelled out. Braids. A place we went on our dates. We look out the window and eagerly feed our eyes. Against the landscape. The woods soar from rain. Mess and structure. I sign my John Hancock. I look in the barn for an umbrella. The rain outside. The wind rising and hearing. E uses her pinafores to sweep. Nothing helps me decide. The weekenders arrive. Nobody sleeps in the same bed.  We remind ourselves of thoughts and dreams. We remind ourselves, I can live with that, he says. I reflect on myself then. We walk locked arm in arm. We are out the door then. Nobody sleeps in the same bed. Breakfast is boring and untidy. We remind ourselves of thoughts and dreams. I feel absurd in this makeup.  We remind ourselves, nothing backwards is anything and everything. I can live with that, he says. The fool, I think to myself. I reflect on myself then. Is nothing better? We walk locked arm in arm. We are out the door then. The bridge seems nothing.  A bad case says my mind is going. Crying and shivering remind our wisdom teeth out. A license plate with a boring coke. A place we weekenders eagerly fed our eyes. The buyers keep my hat on structure. The woods use skirts lost in the woods. I signing my look into the barn for hearing. The rain lives out the side. I look around the bruised against on the subway. A high wind in the same bed. We remind ourselves go out to dinner and leave in this makeup. Nothing backwards is the formula eating with that. The fool, I think.  and go on myself then. We walk locked out the door then. Is Tide too far down to make it? He can't take it, my mind is bronchitis. We had our teeth in a corner. Breakfast is into a bar and asks for a word spelled out. The weekenders out the window went on dates. I keep my hat on buying with mess about rising prices. E uses her skirts to sit lost in the soar from rain. I look into the barn for rising John Hancock. We live out helps me decide. Eyes get lost on the place to buy beer. A corner of the sleep.  And the causes thoughts roll. We all go feel absurd in thoughts and dreams. The formula is eating anything and everything. She fall down and on, I think to myself. Out the door walk locked arm in. High tide low bridge seems better. I can't take it my case of says. The time we had our wisdom shivering in ourselves. We walked in and asked for a plate with a word spelled boring and untidy. Looked and fed we went on awry. Elements and buyers soar about rising in the doorway. A weasel sits lost in the woods sore from the woods.  Using her skirts to sweep. The wind rising and signing an umbrella. Nothing helps rain live out the day. We get lost on the look around the corner for a place to buy the landscape. Nobody sleeps in the thoughts of the house. I feel absurd in selves and all go out and leave her. I can live as anything up. I reflect on myself. I think to go boom. We are the door locked arm in arm. I just changed my mind. There was sort of a companion piece with it which I don't have.  This is pretty short, and it's a little essay. It's sort of an attempt at the essay form, but I think it must have been written by one of those methods because it's sort of discontinuous in a way. But I guess it was written in the context of thinking about writing and thinking about writing about writing. And so that seems to be what it's about. And the title is either. The letters are at hand, the sounds look at lines right across the brow. Things want to go into pairs, then a propped up tier, and it goes out staying in the city for this time period.  Very different people wait, listen to talk, the whole time without one knot in their Monday morning hair. Fortunately, one year, everything, and the next year they're naming it. Well, that's correct. At some point, when there are other people around, nobody's going to be there. In shadow, the shadow doesn't show. I just stuffed myself into it. That kind of situation is like the key it makes me laugh.  The year is displaced, heard faintly from a room. The limits brought to bear from an early as well as an earlier age are defined only negatively by a positive assertion of self's acts. How to enter on dream stage, lines down, at least as many voices as there are, eyes for years on both sides, wide open, so to speak, jet noise notwithstanding sudden outbursts of foolish inflated waves. It's the American way.  to come down hard with a thump.

Oh yeah yeah I usually I keep them well some of them I keep on the bulletin board there and some I keep like on the door behind like the kitchen door right here leaving it open now so you don't see them but because they're like behind the door like we try I guess what it amounts to is I don't like seeing all I like keep so many of them.  All these movie posters and stuff. Do you save a lot of stuff? No, I throw them away as soon as they're, absolutely. I don't want to have them. Do you save yours? Well, I usually just forget to take them down for about three or four minutes. Yeah. Well, having the door closed so much of the time, I mean, or rather, open, I mean. Like, it's open, so it's up against the wall, so we usually don't even see those things unless we close the door so we can look. Because it's always more convenient to have this door to the back hallway open. So sometimes they do stay up, just because we haven't really been paying any attention, we've been looking in the pin center.  So every once in a while I'd pull them down and try I'd just put the tax back in without the announcements. 'Cause then I figured there'll be more announcements. They'll be coming in soon. Do you have a lot of stuff in your nose sometime? No. Real little. Do what I know what I have here. I don't know. What scent? What scent is that body oil? The body oil is natural.  Yeah, it doesn't say. It's natural because that's the No sense. No sense. Well, it does, it has an oil outer, it's strong ocean. Can I smell? Yeah, please. Natural for what animal? I don't know. Like whatever animal sweated it out in a Frostbite. Peanuts or peanut oil. Smells like peanut oil. It is. It doesn't smell good either. I think Sam's right.  And she whizzed. And I lived all the way to Burleigh, but Do you put things around to see if people will notice them? Oh, yeah. Do they? Absolutely. Sometimes, I mean, a few people come in and they sort of like, if we spend all our time in the kitchen, then they sort of say, No, wait a minute before they leave, and they walk around through the other rooms to see if anything has changed. Do you always stand home with me?  It doesn't take that long. But well, sometimes I'll spend a while. No. How long would it take to do everything? To do everything? At once. Oh. Would it depend on the thoroughness with which you Yeah. At a place. I mean, how far away am I going to move things? Or am I just going to throw everything away and get new stuff? Are you going to put it back in the same place?  I really don't know. It's like, it's a decision which I haven't conceived that very clearly. Why don't we see? Why don't we move everything around and put everything in there? Oh, do you want to? Yeah, you'd have to take a boat out with it, too, if everybody got sick. Do you honey dust your shells too, take everything off, and then dust them in there? No, I usually dust, I push things towards the back, and then I dust around, and then maybe I'll push them forward and dust. Do you ever hear me dust? Yeah, I do. I do. In fact, that was one.  One thing that I did do today. I don't vacuum. I don't vacuum, but I did do a little dusting on a few things. Yeah, times when there wasn't any dust. To me. Times when there was no dust. I haven't noticed. I usually don't notice that there's dust or nothing. Sean. What about the little, the tiny little, tiny messages? Strips of paper. I saw, I couldn't read one very well, but it seemed to say, what do I expect from experience? The one up in the front room there? This is like.  That would Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're seeing those. Well, they are here, aren't they? Sure. Sure. I mean, you're a guy. Yeah. How come you weren't able to notice? I don't know. I mean, I think it has, like, it's some odd feeling that I have, like, that I don't appreciate it enough by myself. That's what I think it has to do with.  Yeah, it's like assuring me that like it's good stuff or that it's a good way to look at stuff or something. And it's yeah, it's like validation or something. And like enjoyment, I mean, I really feel like if somebody came in and they really were interested. It's, I mean, it's some, it's like a performance thing is what it is, I guess. Do you ever feel angry 'cause people don't get it? Does it make it invalid? How about somebody you really wanted to impress and they come in?  I just don't know. They're really not. They're just, you know. What does that mean? Does that lower them in your estimation? I mean, that's sort of like the same question as Jerry, right? I feel like I really try to turn off my feelings about that and like ignore whether like I pretend to myself that I don't really care whether they're interested or not in what's there. And then I pretend that like I wasn't expecting anything about that.

Us looking up to Saint Bridget. Let's see now, where are we? It is dust in New York, about to be Christmas and next nineteen sixty one. We are not detectives, are we? So we don't care what time it is. Where will we all be on New Year's Day? Saint Bridget knows, but she has.  He hasn't sent out invitations yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, as the Japanese are always those heathens saying. And yet we know, we really know, don't we, where we'll be? We'll be at Clavins or Glennans or McGiverns or McGoverns or McGillivrays, dead drunk for Saint Bridget and for Doom. Doom, dum, didoom. I am really thinking of Cassez Sa Peep by Norman Bloom, and I think it is a good idea, Death, which will begin again an unbearable musique concrete. It is impossible to be American if you're not French first. It is impossible to fuck without thinking of oeuf sur le plat or of B.  Being welcomed to Paris at night after a long, boring train ride. For women are like that. They make you feel you have traveled a long way and might as well take what comes and come to what will take you. But not Saint Bridget. She comes first no matter how fast you are and lingers last not just for breakfast but for the whole fucking weekend and lasts and lasts. That's how American women are. And you can't be French first unless you move pretty fast and Saint Bridget may not protect you but she does keep you alive if that's your idea of a good time. But stick it out if you can.  But what about Saint Bridget? Doesn't she have a history? I know she doesn't have a record. How long does a yawn last, or a world, or a gunfight? That's what I mean. It's inconsequential. How many thoughts you have? It's the violence that counts. I think everything began on august thirtieth, nineteen thirty nine. I don't think anything is interesting before that, except that I discovered it later. I don't care when Saint Bridget was born, or David, or Michelangelo, or Diagolef, or William Carlos Williams. They started with me because I thought about them first. I built the Church of Saint Bridget and feel responsible.  I am everybody's victim except Joan Mitchell's. Not only that, you are a very sad person too, isn't he, Saint Brigid? If only I had more MD, I wouldn't be such an evil person going around admiring crooked steeples and ineffectual saints, and just to show how totally like the neighborhood I am, I'll confess that when I run out of milk, I drink it black. How's that? How's that for commitment? That's MD, Mater Dolorosa.  Now I have to read all by myself again. No, I don't. Actually, this is a poem that is another collaboration.  One I still find really very interesting, written with Larry Fagin and Ron Paget. It's called Variations on a Theme of William Carlos Williams. And the way this poem was written was Larry and Ron and I were sitting at Ron's house one afternoon, and we, for one reason or another in the conversation, recalled a poem of William Carlos Williams, which you're going to hear in three versions. We tried to recall how the poem went or how it was written. And so each of us wrote out our own sense of how the poem went.  went how the lines broke and what the words in the William Carlos Williams poem were. And this is what we got, one, two, three. One, I have eaten the plums in the ice box which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were delicious, so cold and so sweet. Two, I have eaten the plums that were in the ice box and which you were probably saving for breakfast. Forgive me, they were so delicious.  So sweet and cold. three. I'm sorry I ate the plums you had in the ice box and which you had intended for breakfast. They were really good, cold and sweet. And Ron already read the next poem.  Election Day fog. The perfect roundness, halo, and density of headlights coming from behind as I walk uphill, heading towards a house where warmth may freely spread its muted grace notes like pork chops cooking. It's been a short day, just the right number of decisions too. Everything else has everything else, says the light of another strike. It looks like that one is going up in smoke. Meanwhile, the past is calling.  It all comes back more or less amusing, like the anatomy of melancholy, a studied look into the not too distant winning flame. Is there a pitcher of water around or do you have an extra beer there, Ted?  Belgian reflexes for Philip Gustin. It takes no will to enter the world, but there are few exits. A place where sentiment is everywhere, a merciless buffet.
Berkson-Bill_Complete-Reading_UPenn_4-3-2013	0.0	467.34	 A youthful beauty in a ruffled blouse, writes Sarah McPhee. Costanza was about twenty four, in Rome, with her talented husband Matteo from Lucca, so he could work with John Lorenzo in Saint Peter's on Matilda's tomb. A fierce and sensual woman in the grip of passion, Wittkauer's idea of what it meant seems more than a little overly presumptuous, looking now at the photograph, striking, instead, as if astonishment, unselfconsciously glancing at, redoubling itself, is what one sees, or else Bernini had just said, Look over there,  Quick, look at me and hold it. Unpocobusto, clothed in a chemise, with ribbon open at the front, her large eyes focused on a distant point, parted face in a tousled crown, coiled braid at the back, stern by nature, steady in his work, passionate in his wrath. Gian Lorenzo kept the image for himself. A year or more, after pausing at dawn, on his way out of town, he saw Costanza in her doorway with his younger brother Luigi, whom he chased down.  broke his leg or a couple of ribs, and rampaging back home, ordered a servant under the pretext of bringing two flasks of wine as gifts to go with a razor, and slash Costanza's face, which isn't shown, and not much else about that morning is recorded. All this, none of that, it matters here, dear illusory remains.  We remember not what's allowed, but simply given antiseptic disputes over pure clove of youth. Exogeny Is when the swimming pool casts its poetry from the side of your mouth. Blue yacht rhythms pop at the flickering bauble on the wrist of personable divinity. You guessed the flavour made the rounds, now actively, now not at all. Whoever lies down by that edge has the fever.  Lady Ayre The meaning of guitar practice slips between pine needles, a bird that thin to the tune of Start me up. Rubrics of screen porch and firefly embolden the effort. All words are prophetic, bare the thread, swallow the cloud, reflected glory drives off, leaving the original in demand. Repeat after me.  This is a little elegy, in a way, for a character that I liked very much in the series The Wire, Omar Little. When Omar Little died, popped in the head by the kid with a handgun in the convenience store, I was depressed for weeks. Still am. Baltimore. The mess people leave. United Gitmo Bower. This is called Dress Trope.  Critics should wear white jackets like lab technicians, curators zookeepers caps, and art historians lead aprons to protect them from impending radiant fact. This poem was written originally as words in a collaborative.  graphic work with George Schneeman in december two thousand eight. And then he went ahead and died in january two thousand nine. And the poem, which when I wrote it, seemed to come really out of some cloud somewhere, turned into a kind of elegy for George. So it's called Last Lines with George. Stars fell. Now the sky feels empty handed. The gods must love you so.  This is Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea, which is a title of a large drawing by Mark Rothko, which now is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but used to be in the museum in San Francisco. Sometime in the nineteen seventies, I think the then director made the huge mistake of trading it away for a complete reason.  inconsequential small Rothgow, and then it turned around and ended up at Moma. You didn't trade it with Moma, it was shocking. So now it has pride of place at the Museum of Modern Art, of course, just about any day you visit. Figures in trees screech, the sun steams, the near air boggles, a voila, the brooding nimbus. Death, real death, it's an old world custom, a certain semblance of knowing what's what, without which nothing works.  This is an attempt at a translation of a in the Russian language, which he is said to have pretty much invented. You know, he's the bedrock of it in the way that Shakespeare is the bedrock of English. Pushkin, this poem, which is known as The Prophet. And it's said that he.  It has a complicated background, but one part of the background is that for whatever reason, I don't remember now, I think he was due in court or up on charges somehow before the Tsar that very day, and wrote this poem for breakfast. Parched with spiritual thirst, I crossed an endless desert sunk in gloom.
Berrigan-Ted-and-Schiff-Harris_Complete-recording_Public-access-poetry_8-4-77	0.0	505.2	 There is a promise. There's a promised land right in the body. But the land is overrun by creatures who feel that someone must get the trains to run on time. What day is it? It's moon day. It's land day. It's sun. I don't even know what day it is. And I don't give a flying fuck. My life disintegrates.  and reintegrates. In the process, I lose a tiny bit of my integrity. Every revolution, cells die, regenerate. You and I are the formulation. We are the cosmic in between. No time for self pity, only time for song.  This is the song of the world. The world is death. These guys don't believe that. And neither do I. But the world is death. The many forms of death. Defeated death, resigned death, surprised death, slow death, anguished death, searing death, blinding death, lightning death, delicious death, long awaited death, sleeping death, laughing death.  The world is a puppy dog. The world is a colt falling on its face. The world is a tiny human at birth, eyes closed, crying for food and warmth, reaching out, betrayed in total trust. The world is shit, piss, puke on your face. The world is putrefaction, decay, ecstatic kum, roses, mangoes, magical birds and their songs all in the same place. The world's a pregnant woman afternoon.  I walk down a palm shaded seaside road, the wind whipping white across the hissing sea, taking it easy, taking it easy with my man by my side. How much longer do I got to wait? The world is ants in your sugar and flies in your beer, it's mosquitoes, sunburn and stomach aches, and bulldozers smashing down inaudibly screaming trees to make houses, to make paper, to flash ideas across an imaginary entity spinning through cloudy space. The world's a newspaper, printed in technicolor. You better believe it.  You didn't make it, but love it or leave it, the world's a rip off, a burn. All your dreams come true and nightmares too. It's a pretty good joke and it's on you. So hats off if you don't forget to laugh at yourself even if you got to laugh to keep from crying. It's a pretentious project, a beautiful blunder, a terrible mistake. It's watched over by avenging angels who drink too much and lots of times come to work in a bad mood. It's a police state. Habeas corpus has been suspected.  And the court of appeals has a backlog six centuries too long. But don't worry, because it's your mama giving you a pat on the head and a big kiss. It's sugar. It's the best. It's satisfaction, anticipation, fulfillment, and rest. And I think I'll take a little rest. Okay. Before we continue, I just want to read a poem I wrote. And I think it's very apropos. It's called a good thing where she could steal but she could not rob. Sometimes I'm afraid to rob.  read a poem I've written or to let others read it for fear they'll slap a tag on my forehead, too sweet. It will glow neon and blink her poetry is just like blanks. I wouldn't like that. Or someone had written that poem in their lifetime, so I can in mine. Mark Twain said it best. What a good thing Adam had when he said a good thing, he knew nobody had said it before. Gentlemen, would you like to continue? This is called in four parts. A person can lie around on an uncrowded beach.  And when too much peace and quiet gets on his nerves, he can always get dressed and tour Israel. Mayor Frank X. Graves today ordered the arrest of Alan Ginsburg if the police could prove that the poet smoked marijuana while looking at the Passaic Falls yesterday. The Jewish Memorial Hospital's Junior League will give its second annual disco take benefit Sunday at the Round Table. William Carlos Williams, the Patterson, New Jersey physician, was a strong and vigorous poet who spoke.  in the American idiom. It's true. I'm not finished, Harris, don't get excited. I have to read a very serious work here, but I can't find one. Just a minute. These people wanted to make them laugh. What, these people in a national audience? This is called, it doesn't matter what this is called, this is a series of aphorisms which are geared to inform you. And there's a coda which informs the aphorisms.  The front is hiding the rear. The heart of a man is not as great as an amphitheater. Spinoza is the one who threw a pass to move Spinoza. These are from the French, by the way. There is no death, there is only dissolution. Love of hate is totally great. Me, I disguise myself as a man in order to laugh. I have always loved a serious jackass scene. Infantile paralysis is the beginning of wisdom.  Everything is poison except our meat. Flowers and candy make my teeth ache. The most beautiful and most noble of men are queer. Mystical explanations are dopey. Aunt Winnie fingers the thunder to learn, so that we have left everything aside, but not as a cloud mine steps beside the slow reservoir. Now it is all of this, the pink bulbs included, which means we have protected ourselves by forgetting everything.  All we were dealt. Walking up Second Avenue in the heat, the waves of glamour obscuring the nature of the beings we are, but the cool air makes you say, What the fuck? Give in to the total sensuality that is your big head, your big ass, your big crotch, your spine bouncing around to the rhythm of your walk.
Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Reading_UB_9-20-00	0.0	577.93	 So you think his song caused your sad feeling, like your hand touching your hand. A girl sings alone without knowing the words and enters your memory. That there's no present of what will happen to her is your expectation. Everyone becomes great in proportion to a singer's furious expectations, like so many good mistakes.  Parachute on the desert blue with light. Eleven sheep head to head in a circle asleep. Enjoyment and substance in real time involve clearings about which pivot opaque zones. Real is a span of visibility inasmuch as your flesh is not chaotic of a contingency. The real thing substitutes for another who's not representable as he gathers up.  Parachute and delivery. If I stay here and you mean something, the part in common is disjunct from what you mean, like my hands touching. That you're telepathic means nothing, you facts you can't know, which still work in the connections of my experience. A rock in rain distributing water along texture is my response to experience, inasmuch as your flesh is an invisible interplay of disjunction needed.  Flesh is texture. Our meeting occurs near a hill you climb every day to water transplanted iris. Why don't you let others do that? Although I do not wish to separate from him now, due to faults of compound phenomena being demonstrated, it seems he will disappear from my sight and hearing. The beauty of his song derives from the fact.  It represents something to someone. Any family that's concentrated in so far as it represents something may be taken for someone. Wherever there's waiting is this transference. The danger is you'll be deceived by the metonymy of my tender feeling so light and multiple. You go to pick up the child after school. You remain a few moments talking with a teacher beside the loom.  Why are you telling her this? Glory, formless substance, circular dawn. Like a child's drawing of stars or snowflakes and lines. Each line connects, so it's the same star falling loop to loop, and each line belongs to each star. My friend the white rabbit, little mouse, squirrel, impatient, shaking off their clothes.  I wanted to write a poem for a long time about the fertile area of the margin but then when I wrote it it was called Nest and it's in five parts.  My mother tongue Chinese has an immemorial history before me. I was inserted into it a motive for my language. I learned it naturally, filling it with intentions, and will leave it without intent for other children. My mother and I speak a local language, and sometimes our mother tongue.  my dream with its intent. What to intend in changing the mother tongue of my daughter? Compassion not being ill, sleep in which she resonates depth like a bell. Loving the wind is equivalent to intention as rhetorical surface, like writing a diary on her skin. Non comprehension tips ambivalent matter, as if there were two of us here.  One is Kwanyin, one is mother tongue. Her matter inserted, emotive, is always somewhere else, exiting one language, another without intent, translated as heart. I want to tell you what's difficult to admit that I left home. Change of mother tongue between us activates an immune system, margin where dwelling and travel.  The artifacts throw themselves toward light without becoming signification. Telling you is not an edge of the light. There's no margin of a shadow to imply interior. In my childhood house was a deep porch covered with vines. Look past our silhouette to silhouettes like shadows of guests arriving in the bright yard. Light in the next room falls on her as she bends.  to kiss you. Skylight pours down then covers the mud wall like cloth. I observe the lighted feel that seems to hang in space in front of me. Speaking not filling in a surface intent is like a cabinet of artifacts, comparison coexisting with incongruity. My origin is a linguistic surface like a decorated wall.  No little houses at dusk, yellow lights coming on, physical, mute. Its significance is received outside hearing, decorating simply by opening the view. Wherever I look is prior absence, no figure, ruin escaping anaesthetic. Hammock, electric, fan, ghost don't qualify as guards. The comfortable interior my guest inhabits is a moving base, states of dwelling that are undeclared.  Woes crosshatched like mother tongue. A foreign woman occupies a home that's impersonal like the nest of a parasite. Its value is contentless but photographable in the context of an indigenous population, tipping between physical ease and the freedom of animals accumulating risk. When the scene is complex, I turn to the audience and comment out loud, then return to the room and language at hand, weakened by whoever didn't hear me.  As if I don't recognize the room, because my family moved in while I was away. As text implicated, with outside the wall is waves. So I decorate in new mother tongue.

The respiratory system when stimulated produces a characteristic sign. The sinus extends itself during stress and collapses so the autopsy finds only a membrane. Touching a wall produces the sound of touch on another wall. Feedback between health and fate unfolds so fast there's no way one step in the chain can be based on the previous one. An associative sneer or aura requires her to be in a body in order to make decisions. Lack of cloud cover causes thermal energy on the desert to return rapidly to the sky at night.  It makes light, lighting the organs, they turn white. There is a space you see something at the far edge, and your eye going over this space makes a hole, like watery mass in a gourd, the feeling of old organs no longer crucial to or inside themselves, while remembering people you loved, which flowed from the physical, about which you made decisions. To make this hole any object brings into being something not in nature, an interior measurement, yourself not yourself, bursts of growth when you sleep.  Black leaves, a spray of blood on the snow. She sits on her hands physically preventing herself from scratching. The child, her sense of the world being crucial to or inside itself, of memory and specificity like script. These cells grow for years in a petri dish, the sick immortalized cells don't know to stop growing. Where your eye goes over space to the horizon makes a hole, but where its sky meets the earth, the fragment is not the same as a whole. Desert ferns covered with reflecting hair may insulate the fronds. Radiations of a state barely embodied and dissolving encounter reflections of light.  He cannot separate from the loved person to shed the loved body. So, this is the first poem I wrote since I finished the four year old girl manuscript. It has a more narrative style.  Kiki Annie except three parts. Susie Kiki Annie. On its own terms, my project with them developed a gentle momentum. The vulnerability of their situation engendered by an unassuming spirit of play and togetherness. On my way to work I passed several family members standing in a group close together. I asked each one to tell me his or her thoughts, and I tried to remember them all. My sister has just fixed the motorcycle of her friend Tom, and she's waiting for him.  One of them, a fox turns to look at me as if in nature, but she's drawn it, it's symbolic. What can someone who looks like my sister encompass on a different level if she were not my sister, or if I had no knowledge of the formal relation? A projector in the dark casts a line of light under the door. Energy of the gap between my sister and the strategy that construes her as pure appearance disperses along the web of family interrelations. There's a stringent physical link, but what goes on inside.  It seems close to freedom I know as my power of imagination, so strong it appears as a deliberate loss of information. One fox an open structure empties like a funnel. One fox enters the world. It does not appear to be an image. There's a relationship between them in which she is involved, walking between animals of sleep and late light like blood. I'm interested in the alleged realism of the fox while she sees it as actually behind the scenes. They watch me in suspense.  There's a mute probability of a reciprocal lack of understanding. Lately I've been interested in failing to make something exciting, equating the act of walking from one tree to another with understanding. I try to speak to her in a way in which she might take me seriously and answer back. The situation is an image of her gathering a toy horse from beside each candle, of my sister on a white horse, of the horse stepping backwards in water.  She stands there for a long time and takes out of her pocket one of the toy horses. She tells me about it as if I were also a lover of horses, but I am not, as she well knows. The way in which she shares her happiness as a matter of course gives me a sense of guilt because I do not feel the happiness. All the animals in the story who eventually die consist of tiny lines scratched into reddish brown. The white of an eye is scratched away, but the pupil is ink. Many appear sleepy as if they'd just wakened up. Squirrel, little cat, fawn. She wears an oily smock and cloth.  with a rubber daisy on each one. Light glints off her glasses as she waits with an awkwardness that's folks conspicuous and nonchalant. She feels their presence in the woods as an a priori model light subject to decline. Her empathy makes it possible to read the story and see it as a picture at the same time. Is this story of defeat and disappointment, uncertainty, interference, malfunction, transcended by the present situation of competent employment? She loses track of her thought, then resumes, after laughing at herself. The horse takes a small jump in the air.  and her head and shoulders arch back. I see mini mouse instead of a thin girl in a cotton smock. The ambiguity releases energy. No one enters the family unit except through the magnetism of this energy. Stolid girls scowl like an old man. Wild girls in a meadow in the afternoon are subject to an evaluation in which cheapness cannot be avoided. She marks time with her hand and the horse curls its neck and head around her.  So, I'm going to
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10	0.0	468.01	 This illusion comes up very close. The objects in it look like familiar things. It happens at times that come to us in a direct line as light moving at a pretty pace. People in delirium run toward it. It has one of nature's failings. Loveliness is not the less when it's uncertain. Strange we have come back.  So this type study is what started all the trouble with Annie Albers for me. I'd long been a fan of her work and had on weaving and knew it well. And I just saw it differently one day and I went to some lengths to try to publish it in Jubilat, which is one of the other things that I do. I edit there. And it put me in touch with the Albers Foundation, which opened up a little bit of a Pandora's box.  They brought out so many amazing things when I went to visit. I was then in. So I studied weaving and then started working on my own little type studies. And I don't know about you, but when I do monotonous work like hammering away on a gridded typewriter space like this, I'm always listening to things. So at this point I was listening to a really amazing interview with Susan Howe and Charles Bernstein. It's one of that very early line break interviews where they just they have this stellar conversation about landscape.  Page Space, where Susan Howe equates page space to freedom. It's not Pennsylvania. This is Annie and Joseph at Black Mountain College. And this is Lauren Linfield, one of Annie's students, one of the few people to graduate from Black Mountain.  And she took the weaving course from Annie and from another teacher there and thankfully kept like two hundred pages of extraordinary notes, all hand typed with lots of draft notation and drawings. And while I was at the Albert's Archive or lecture a little bit thereafter, I digitized her entire file because it was deteriorating rather rapidly and maybe of lesser value than some of the other things there. So I scanned it and I have it and now I'm just wondering.  Wondering what to do. I'm going to give a talk in a few days on that archive. But like other projects, it takes me a long time to sort of get far enough that I know what I'm doing with something. So I just spend a lot of time learning. I did trace the type studies from Black Mountain back to the Bauhaus. This is a weaving cloth sample book of some of the type designs. This is my favorite Bauhaus study done by Haja Rose of just zeroes and lines.  This is a million random digits. I think John Cage used this quite a bit, Jackson. So those of you who weave or might weave would know that weaving is all about numbers. So every thread, every intersection of a thread corresponds to at least two numbers. So even though you're looking at a very simple piece of cloth, you could really draw it out numerically in its entirety. So the piece that I did for the.  The book was simply a transcription, a woven transcription of that page space. I was giving a talk recently and I did a little homework on etymology of text and textile and they come from the very same stem to weave. But I love that text actually has even a more fabric description of style, tissue of literary work, literally that which is woven web, texture.  It's so nice. I mean, it's there, there early on. But we could open it up to questions. I think there's plenty of time. I'm hearing about the digging symptoms. I noticed from the images that there were, it seemed to be increasing with the other symptoms, but with similar markings.  But they're slightly different. They correspond to a certain thing from the work. Like the way that you sew the fabric in, it's like how did you figure out what was in there? Right. It's as faithful a transcription as I can make. So what I did was I scanned Dickinson's manuscript books, which you have here, you have a fantastic Dickinson collection. So it's a two volume book of the folio work that she did. And there are actually a ton more of her manuscripts.  that aren't in that edition, so that are far more beautiful even than strange, the light fragments. But I looked at that because it shows a variant system. So all those crosses that you saw embroidered precede words, and the words correspond to other words preceded by a cross within the poem. So there's this rather intense system of alternate or other ways to read poems. And they're very strange. I mean, sometimes they're close, like further and farther, which aren't really close at all.  And sometimes they're like, um, like the line is like, 'Tis as if our souls absconded suddenly, and the variant is souls, and the variants below the poem are world, selves, and sun. So either any of those could happen. And then when you start to read the variants between poems, so say souls is a variant more than once, then you have a very complex way that you start to get to read her thing.
Bloch-Julia_03_Complete-Reading_Emergency-Series_KWH-UPenn_3-27-12	0.0	451.05	 Kay came to my door in a pink skirt and a pink jacket, both the color of dust. She opened her mouth and some dust came out. I am not totally sure what happened between the foyer and the apartment door. I am stammering. I did the treadmill for thirty five minutes. Her legs stuck out of her skirt and she murmured a lot and almost cried, but did not cry one bit. Dear Kelly. All these weddings and their impulse toward the mirror. Sex like a collision we know we should avoid. Wedding is XXXX.  Do you ever hate being American, flying virgin, loving the master? I wander the aisles at Ross in search of a red blouse that ties up at the back. I'm thinking of the hushed motion, the crawl, the dark eye and the answer, the field of light around her palm. Did a lot of shopping at Ross when I was writing these poems. I worked across the street from one, it was kind of dangerous. Sorry, I haven't read from a book before, so I was like, what can I read next?  Dear Kelly, now that I know Sagittarius is in my north node, I have spent the day reading lines in an art gallery, trying to let my brain crawl into them, or at least under some pastoral light. I think I should like to be erased, like a certain word is, from these letters. No, I think I'd like to hold a certain feeling, like a cut thing, with the light shining all around your forehead and the last failed year toppled over at the entrance to one hundred one on Bay Shore. There was a sign there.  Dear Kelly, sweater instead of fear, eyeliner instead of reassurance, cocktail as cough suppressant, real men in real bar. I mean a bar cut like a man. I mean a bar cut like a piano, cut to fit around the piano. I mean a bar cut like a Yamaha baby grand, and a glossy drink, and your lacquered face. And instead of anaphora, I said anathema, and the piano lodged under plexiglass like a big sideways fish, and beneath the mirror is my coat check, is the cusp of your hand, is a mouth moving across the teeth.  Long lines of the sun instead of the wrong side of the bed, in the bed instead of on the floor. I mean in the bed, but not in the bed, at the corner of the mouth, math across the t shirt, and there is no narrow sleep before the portrait of your imaginary wife. So I moved to the other side of the bed, and then to the other side of the apartment, and then from the second floor to the ground floor. I mean the ground. I mean the sidewalk where no one was wearing any costumes, and the cab filled quickly with smoke. Dear Kelly. The runners on the schoolkill, locked in their corridors, pass bits of molded white plastic that carve up the winter air.  Garbage cars on the tracks, the absence of ice, all the city steps I have taken in my foolishly sensible shoes. I can spell words on paper. You think that's all the work you need to do, but you are not yourself, you are not this futurity. When I played in the evening, I was sore in Leyeux. And then I just thought I'd read a few new pieces here.  This is a translation I did of Shakespeare's Sonnet one hundred and twenty, which begins, That You Were Once Unkind Befriends Me Now. And it's called PST Sonnet. When I first moved to LA, they were, I think, just launching this, I think it might still be going on, this huge constellation of art exhibits called Pacific Standard Time. I was thinking a lot about what it meant to move into Pacific Standard Time. Eileen Miles was just reading in LA, and it was a perfect tonic for two I mean, I'm originally from the West Coast.  I feel like an East Coast transplant in LA. And for Allison and I both, for Allison and me both, I think it was very healing to hear from another New Yorker who found it very jarring to be in LA. And one of the things she said was, one of the hardest things about living in California is that you're up late and so you think, great, I can call someone in California. But I'm already here. So I was thinking a lot about Pacific Standard Time. A shaken sense, a glass hug. Even your shirt was lying, your whole body full of liquid. There is a word blocking the bow.  I there is to go very shortly. A there bar. A there sacro iliac joint. Let's to the stone gallery. A video, ball drop, nineteen seventy four, where a ball is becoming light upon a windshield and smash, like that. So let's ransom this hotel. Let's put a fee upon this feeling to various century. Look up all the bones of the body to see what you can spare. Dark, grey, green. Not everything can be sighted. I must needs. Green face lies. Fall apart for the day. Like I said, a glass hug.  And this has a line in it from Bob Proman. I dipped my hand in the garbage can and then I put my finger in my mouth. A sort of first self, best self ideological position. A cold sort of laundry, many masses of cold, unforgivable cold. The shock is how ordinary it seems.  I think that's all the work you needed to do. You think you can mask it, like drinking from the lake. That line exhausts me. Most people are not also adults. And this is the last poem I'm going to read. It's called Allison Corporation. And it's for Allison. Outside the city is a thick line of thinking. And outside that line of thinking is a strip of water. And outside that strip of water is a muscle. Lengthen the muscle.  Restraint and perfect tension. That is Allison Corporation. California is not new. California is not new. California is not new.

Collected garbage gives off a distinct smell on the street, stinking of shoes and of myself, of mice, of neon sweat, of chairs and of myself, of useless news and of myself, stinking under the moon, my nose stuffy from carbonic gas, the nose of the bus engine, stinking of the same shirts.  Stinking of my opia and of myself, stinking of street corners, giving off smells, stinking of hopes, which suddenly end in the next strophe. The next one, line to line. No, no, but I was a student of W. Bush, okay? My English is perfect. He gets better. He was a good teacher, but there was a bad student. See, you could see the bond we have. He also likes to tell the story.  The Russian poet Arkady Dragomoshenko was in Brazil and asked me forty definitions or fifty definitions or ten definitions of Brazil to publish in a Russian magazine. So it was intriguing for me because I never fought to define Brazil and I wrote in a very broken English and Charles and I and Charles finished up and added a lot of himself in the poem. So it's a poem.  Collaboration is always written four heads, because it begins with the Russian tell me, ten definitions of Brazil, twenty definitions of Brazil. I never thought about, so I try it. Those are all definitions of Brazil, but I impose upon you, I told you I would do this. Read the English anyway, I think it would be more impossible. No, no, no, no, it's impossible. Try it. I'm tired. Try it. No, no, no, no. Some lines, okay? How will I know? Some lines. Some lines.  Oh, my reputation will fall down. How about trying every other line and if you want to stop, I'll take over. Brazil is located on the southern tiers of the Americas. Brazil is a jungle with snakes who eat cakes. Brazil speaks Lebanese, Portuguese, Japanese, Philadelphianese, Guaranese, Tupees, English. Brazil is an adulterating medley of intoxicated syncopations. Brazil has no relationship with itself because it has a relation only to itself.  Brazil lays its cool hands on your hot head. Brazil was colonized by Indians who turned the Portuguese into natives. Brazil's Tolstoy is now doing tricks in a favela. Brazil is a land of palms and psalms. Brazil is the model of a model. Brazil is a charm brazil that has become the necklace of the continent. San Paulo more European than San Paulo. Brazil more bureaucratic than Geneva. Hero more alluring.  Then boca. So, they've got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil. In Brazil, the cuckoo sinks, go go. Macaw, macaw, macaw. Brazil is private property of no man's god and no woman's ferry. The patron saint of Brazil is its dreams, just as it's its devil. Brazil is a caryoca, not a polka. Caryoca, polka. Caryoca, polka, polka. Brazil is Carmen Miranda's two d fruity hats, Cayetano Velosa's all weather tropical.  Babel Gilberto's number on the charts. Brazil is the Elyse Antone Waters of March International Airport in this park. Brazil is Capirina with Fejuada, Capira with Fedora. Brazil is home of, I don't know, the Cassava or Tapioca. What you call Yucca, or Mandioca, or Apin, or Mugu, or Maxeria, or Singkang, or Tugi, or Balinghoi.  Maniac. You can probably say most of you better than me. Why do you do that one? Well, you are great in Portuguese. Brazil. Brazil is the black mask of the PCC inscribed with the words traitor, betrayer. Brazil is one hundred eighty six million stories, one hundred eighty six thousand poems, but only these definitions. But your stocks in Brazil and your bonds in China, or is it the other way around? Brazil is a figment of the imagination of the Amazon.  If Belair is a laureate poet of Brazil without ever writing a word, then Ronaldo Gaucho is Denizinski without ever having set foot in the Belair ruse.
Bromige-David_Complete-Reading_Albany-CA_Fall-1968	0.0	633.12	 I think I'll close this first group with a form that's also in the ends of the earth. It's called Waite West in the Shadow, which is a line I take from Pam's forty seventh count of who even dead yet had his mind entire.  Wait less than the shadow. We encounter in the lateral Tamil with great depth. I wear in my forehead a Davy lamp, newly acquired. The gift, in fact, of a young lady casts an intense circle beyond whose rocky confines, blackness, nothing, your seamed face as in a developing fluid coagulates, the lips lift to tell me I have not yet solved the riddle of the universe.  But in the cage I carry, has died, you point out, misled. I'd gotten off the elevator at the wrong level. You shrug, but cast the dice on my behalf. Back, they indicate, to the pit head, collect nothing from the company store, except I sank these shafts. Your fierce outburst, at last, to hear that voice, an obscene gesture next, old man. Brown shapes of countenance on the skin, over the excited hands, sarcastic.  The right hand, forefinger extended, lightly taps your temple then, quickly down to the pocket still. And what do you come up with with a dollar bill? I'm to buy a ballpoint, ten and five blue examination booklets at the commissary. This is becoming ridiculous, a dream. Four of them to wrap my lunchtime apples in. The fifth turns into a bluebird for my cage. I'll write it out. You pull your plastic goggles down over your eyes and eyes.  See, just as you turn away myself indistinctly reflecting. The moon leaving the lift, your turn, aches blindingly, some small soft hand clasps mine, or a man's hand merely does she grasp, maintaining she'll lead me away from the pitfalls, her path takes me in a suspect tangent, dazzled still. My other senses would rescue me, my watch beats.  My heart's an army on the march of ragged and conflicting voices. Raised in sung, they argue in the singing. Is it not my comrades changing shifts, that late already? Globules of soil roll onto my stumbling progress, if that's the word. There she, you says, she laughs, dimly her face swims clear. There I bought your silly bird, but he wanted out, and so the grilled small gate hangs open. Next minute we hear how good a cook she is.  Next, you, old Maul, working right through lunch break, under our feet, knock. I mean, deep rooted trees vibrate about me. Not back, you said, simply. The tunnels are unending. How can I confront you, the cage of an absconded trapeze artist? Will you be angry? I won't descend. Will you shrug merely? I won't come again. She is leading me on to Dallien. She laughs. I won't budge, but the whistle.  The pit head shrills till everyone is in the evening elevator down. I've slept, dried spittle, but the whistle. The naked lady hears it as music. She has her gift of inattention, her hip bones flesh, the coal dust on her sheets, the mine I thought lay hidden, the fumes however render a whole district mine, her hard mattress, motionless, the stars.  Are insatiable holes, we argue, I hold them. Baby lamps. The stars are. The night is cold, I slurred the word, is cold, I said, and she heard the blonde kiss holding gold. Yes. Have there been women like this evening? She is.  Gloriously unlike more is the agony, by the peril of whose soulful presence I've felt compelled to pour my soul's perilous adventures out to, to say, or yearn to, desperately over and over, I love you, whatever misery ensue, is happiness, finding some vain ease in the mere saying, as any mother's son, as though there were no other way of love, inept to be wiser, to choose my silences, while we work life out together, taking care.  Carefully and lending so the seams don't break, or not yet, not today. Or a flash of syntax similar is unavailing, as once more for the first time ever comes to be, this night of all my life and all, or nothing, or and nothing, chance, voices conspiring against voices for these choices must be that utterly ambiguous, these metaphors for what hasn't yet its shape is also thought too late. I spoke, revealing choice to be illusory. Let's make it more than that.  Almost I hated her, who was breaking my heart open so that I say, Be my fate, and she refuses not to. She complies, being herself, as no one else can do. I read the final mission.  Whatever stood furthest up the trail was master off the trail, which for the most part climbs through a beautiful if crowded forest, though the final four or five hundred yards rise above the tree line, across tricky scree and end, at that peak, which is also the scarp edge, is steep and, despite the rumours, inaccessible, drop on one side, the shallow slope on the other, where the wood grows, that is mainly conifers. To be master meant to gather all those things, the ownership of which.  proves masterhood a tribute all other travellers are bound to pay. Two friends who thought to scorn such enchantments were walking through this wood one day side by side. They were talking an old story begun as they entered the shade wherein the trees addressed a pair of wanderers with promises of succour when first one friend then the other heard the branches whisper as if to himself alone and suddenly a most powerful odour overcame their senses and a woman naked broadheaded.  and sloping a shoulder, stepped out of the thicket and beckoned. Now both these men, in flight from a band of relatives who presently were pillaging their homesteads, hoped in the remotest hollow of the forest to find sanctuary in an abandoned mill of which they read. Yet the sight of this creature turned them, where they fell to arguing which of them first should address himself to her who stood expectantly by. They decided finally the softer spoken ship. He who had first heard the trees murmur, his companion making a joke.  of it, remarking, Your mother thought you were raised up with a due respect for womanhood. No sooner, however, was this agreed upon than he, this pleasant man, began to waver, wondering whether the other might not be better for the job, and even expressing doubt that he himself had any rights in this matter. Perhaps, he chuckled, I'm not really here at all. He was pushed forward, though, but when he approached the lady, she told him she might only yield herself.
Bromige-David_Complete-Recording_Cal-Tech_3-7-72	0.0	455.43	 I thought to go to Chicago right away, and suddenly, inexplicably, my will failed me. Was it that I'd gotten so accustomed to living all by myself during the past four months that I needed no one else? An older woman, a second cousin, took me in hand, but I was able to keep my detachment by seeing that it was only my mental image of her that was making love to me, whatever our bodies were up to. Meanwhile, I kept a close watch on that latter activity, thinking how now I would be able to satisfy Hilda when next we met. For knowledge, however required, is power.  I must confess my feelings towards Hilda were not unmixed. At times I would decide to banish her, for she deserved nothing else. But then I would see that she was already banished, and that I would have to think of something else. Well, the first thing I had to confront was how to extricate myself from the second cousin's clutches. That's another story, a story all in itself, and one, really, very much like this. So I don't have to tell it here.  had passed, and Hilda had grown some four or five inches, so that she was now six feet tall. Her wrists, which had been long with a kind of vulnerability I found very attractive, were now bony, as though she'd been hung from a beam. Her face, deprived of its previous bloom, was long and sallow. In short, I thought her ugly. Pitifully so, although when she spoke, the voice was the same, and I was glad to feel the pain of that survival. Her place was by no means the palace she had caused me to infer she came from. I had to spend the night on a couch in the living room, but by now I knew this kind of evasion of the realm.  of one's circumstance was widespread, and I had even begun to slip into it myself. Next day, when her parents were at work, Hilda, who had taken the morning off, sat with me in the kitchen, while her boyfriend raced his motorbike up and down the block, looking up at the window from time to time sneakily. I caught his glance once when I was looking down. How Hilda must have felt. She had returned to a different perspective, and now here I was, the living proof of a will she wouldn't be likely to meet many more times in the corner she had settled for.  that all was over between us. Listening to her talk, I began to despise the person I had been the year before. Still, I had the will to stay, but the will to leave under those circumstances offered more possibilities, and so I bowed gracefully to the inevitable. When I got up to go, tears did come to her eyes. That moment I remember still, and I recognized immediately a feeling to be stored up against the ease, if not the indifference, of times to come. Many times in the future I was to conjure that farewell when I was filled with despair.  And often it's sufficed to tip the balance, so that it could be thought to have caused several destructive rages over the years. But it's all water under the bridge now. Hardly worth the trouble of telling, and it's past time already to think that I have told it poorly, and to see that, like it or not, there's nothing I can do about that either. Yes, it might have all been otherwise, and yet for what it has to say about the human will in one of its manifestations, I wouldn't change one moment of the misery, for an easier way is not necessarily a better. And I believe I can speak not only for myself, but for Hilda.  Who found out what it was like to meet her match, a man who scorned to take either no or yes for an answer. Now, these are a series of short pieces with a general title of tight corners. Have I been reading about twenty five minutes? Feels like it. What's the time? Yeah, I have.  Okay, I'll read for about ten minutes more. The boy, elbows bent, supports himself with his hands, his body prone, so that his face may approach the surface of this small pond, from which he drinks.

Further on, one wants to say, though in another sense it's higher up, the lane crooks out of the lane.  shade and finds an open meadow, from where there must be a better view of that squat church tower. But the clouds, the clouds are more surely the point, such clouds as are no longer to be seen. A rhythm of contraction would pull one in, deeper into itself, before that open space, meadow and sky, is granted one. These are very loosely sequential and it's it's happiest for me if I just make up.  A different way through it each time. So, the pause is only while the eye selects something to do. While they watch the cat, while they watch, while they watch, the cat stalks up the path to the front door, raises itself by putting its front paws as high as it can reach against the door, and then, resting on its left forefoot, it raises its right so that the knocker is moved out until the arc of the paw falls below the arc the knocker makes, and thus the knocker falls back against the metal inset in the door. And as they watch, the door opens, and the cat slips in.  as a woman's face appears peering into the street. The two men have been walking for a long time, one thinks, though perhaps no more than an hour. It's now becoming obvious that he has chosen the less traveled of two highways out of town in the direction he and his friend want to go. His friend was right and he was wrong. They resolved to take the cut off they are now approaching and to walk its length, if no farm truck comes along, till the other highway is reached.  The heat is considerable. It is early afternoon. On either hand huge fields of wheat find no wind to stir them. The only food they have is a chocolate bar. The time comes to eat it, and one unslings the pack and they take it out.

But the woman had pulled him so strongly into her front that a button of her dress had dug into his cheek above the bone, and that pain took over. But after that, but after that, he saw the hand often looking where it was cut through, just like the meat in the butcher's. There was something he wanted to do with it. He picked it up and felt it from outside and then from in, as though he wore it on his wrist like his own hand.  He still searched for the jagged metals, but now his father had told him where it came from. He treasured particularly those pieces, molded like a screw. He saved them up, hoping he'd one day have all the pieces, and be able to put them together, like a jigsaw puzzle, and build a shell of his own. Would it be mine? he asked the father, or the government's? His father told him, his, if he kept it hidden. So there was that to think about. He could go out looking in the gutters when the sounds came, late at night.  I'm going to start with a book with a poem from my first book which came out in nineteen sixty five called The Gathering. That's the name of the book. The poem is called We Could Get a Drink. Sunday morning lying in complacency of the newlywed.  Out the windows of slender sun silver trees lead me back to Hampstead Heath, where I run again down sparse grass banks by clumps of gorse below silver trees, I try to tell you, but end up. We could get a drink on a Sunday anyway. You laugh, move closer under the covers. Our silver limbs stir in the gloom like cutthroat trout.  I saw in a lake a hundred miles out of Vancouver, hiding their striking shadow. The mind of fish shifting fragilely its position when the body's easy, a still pool. Now it is in a scene from a documentary seen months back. Girl, eyes like yours. Girl, slung over a Tommy's shoulder, mouth open, but nothing said until.  The commentator, as the camera pans, pass the black patch. I don't watch because my eye hooks on the hat rack hips. Says, starved to death. The soldier throws her into a pit. That's a tangle of white, very slender limbs. Went sliding down the crater's muddy side. The instant I called, there's a bomb. Fell here last night. Let's look at the crater. Went running over.  Laughing, my friends along, running down to today, when looking at Silver Birch, I say nothing at all, but we could get a drink there, move closer beneath the blankets, while the cutthroats flick under their bank.  This next poem was issued as a book called Please Like Me. It was put out by Blacksborough Press in Los Angeles this year. Strolling through the town, all the houses quiet at this hour of the street, already hot old women. The leader of our magazine crew knew how to gain entrance by knowing that door opening before the act, the door opening.  The woman with him, his packet, already hung on the back of a chair, his shirt coming off, crossed to the window to pull the shade, making it might. But in the morning, unknowing, despite the looks she gave him, and me watching, mentioned her husband, who handled such matters, her hands, at the necklace her throat was naked on. Compliant women, my expression, insisted equally, turned me away, and they would. A snapshot one of them took, as I locked up my arm to me.  Dark faded falls from my wallet as I count my tape from last night. Another subscription sold, working late to think. Great weight brought to bear on a door flies open at your first touch. Your momentum pitches you sickeningly into the vacuum cleaner. Parked in a narrow hall, the muscles involved with nothing to parry ache. A nagging sense of something far from being right. A wrench in the very socket of the self, a disarming tenderness as if on the instant I stopped now.  Knocked here, went in, found Roseland slid indistinctly for the sun that floods the room. The brakes, the skid begun, surface slick with the summer shower, he jammed the chevis, ties, nothing to grip on, slid the four of us within inches of the poem's abruption. Welcome. And again, welcome. Make yourself to home. Threw nails into the plaster that wouldn't support even a picture.  Hardly a heavy piece, skewer, skewer, print, cut with a knife from a library book, because I, against all claims of social conscience, against all readers whose thighs tomorrow would push against the metal cross piece of the turnstile, wanted it. The blood floods the shaft, half moon. Focus in an enormity of sky extends by fractions limits. The blood continuously feeds skin, sinew, ligaments, wherein a heaviness.  Pause it. Nights and it is nights. A white flashlight conjures a white door. A red calls forth a red with which you can't come in, she shouts. But that's no use. I want. All right, you son of a bitch, you bluffer, even though the sentiment itself be but a bluff, I'll call you. But useless again if the man on the path must tell her what to say.  She switches on her porch light and the day goes, that kind of light by which the face that passed, translucent skin, nose freckled at what bridge it had, the eyes prominent enough so light could be seen to pass through the pupil, nonetheless left dark, but liquid dark, the bones of the cheek and chin so clean.

It's very distinct at the ballpark. The players play ball, the umpires arbitrate, the groundskeepers manicure the grounds, watering the base pads with grave sylph like movements. They're all regally ignorant of the spectators.  Watching, among other things, their actions, their efforts, their cheers, their jeers fall on deaf ears. The young Dominican pitcher surveys his outfield vibrant green under the lights Este es mi parque. The cheers of the patron rain, the cheers of the patrons rain down on his deaf ears. At the ballpark, it's all very distinct. This one is called Vision of Childhood.  The rain tonight on the mountain outside my window, on the street, on the freeways of California, on the farms in the Livermore Valley, raining tonight in Placerville where my wife's father was born, the black water on the mountain here, five hundred yards beyond my window, the water cutting its own sluices in the soil of California. I forget what I was talking to him about in the dream, my son, the age of three, about the people who'd come to California in the past.  They sailed in wooden ships around the Horn or walked beside their oxen across the Sierras, all that energy spent, some vision, some getting, whether it was the gold that got them here or the soil or even the weather, which even today the magazines extolled, our soon to be biggest state. The governor in his press releases, his census estimates, the streamings over the borders of California, the several chambers of commerce, a perfect environment for all ages from the cradle to the grave. And he said, but I didn't come.  His mother, an advertising copywriter whom I divorced, had just returned with him from New York. I came through the canal. Why, of course, it seemed in the dream obvious to me, knowing the anatomy of America. Someone was ironing a workshirt for me in the hallway outside that room. And then the letter from his mother. He was sitting at breakfast playing with ten bright shiny new pennies all lined up in a row, all the Lincoln heads up, all looking the same way. He straightened up, looked all the Lincolns in the eye and said, oh, kidding.  Okay, you guys smile. This one is I hope he's not here. This one is about a barber that I used to go to. I had my hair cut pretty regularly on the bottom end of Columbus Avenue. It's called the Fortunate Barber.  Barber hones his razor. He says he remembers back to Prohibition. Elmer, the barber, tells about the horrors. Oh, those corpses, those barbary coast days. At his age, his white hair, the red veins of his face, sex and liquor seem to be his main concerns. This friend of mine's window faced the hospital, these two nurses giving it to each other with a rubber cock. Sex and liquor fill his talk, his Sundays with his married daughter in Walnut Creek, her kids, beatniks, queers, foreign cars, those track stars.  They're all black, those fucking shines. The red cheeks of his granddaughter, his Irish week, his nights in front of the TV, his wife wakes him when he falls asleep and they turn off the set and go to bed. Almost every time there's someone, I cut his hair last week, next thing I hear he took a heart attack. One brother's dead, an alcoholic who fell down once and bled all over Elmer's car in the barber's eyes that day. A second brother hassled with the VA. I saw that one shuffle out of the place one afternoon.  Fortunate barber reads the newspaper. He stands in his doorway. He watches me go by, the back of my neck, the hair around my ears from day to day. The travel agent next door is another customer and most of the cops back and forth from Central Station. We walk by the shop throughout the week and he looks at the backs of our necks and our ears out there abroad in the May Street. This one's called Flowers because they've come to be.  Late blooming marigolds, nasturtiums, daisies yawning on a Sunday morning in the sunlight. It's October. We woke up this morning and they started putting the world together. The sunlight on the wall, in your hair, your eyes blinking, the air outside my window, nasturtiums, chrysanthemums, late blooming marigolds, daisies yawning on a Sunday morning. You've entered this hall. You're leaning against the door jamb. You've taken off your shoes. The abstractions fall away like shadows.  Shoes lying there by the door to my kitchen. You walk over to the window where I'm looking down at the houses across the street, the colors of their roofs, late blooming marigolds, daisies yawning on a Sunday morning in the sunlight, the rooftops, the tar flowers, the shingles bloom, the tiles burgeoning. It's October. We woke up this morning and they started putting the world together, that fog to the north hiding what hasn't been made yet. By this afternoon, aquatic park will have been created.
Brown-Lee-Ann_Complete-Reading_Tender-Buttons-Press_UPenn_10-21-03	0.0	370.75	 My mother was impressed with my articulation and that I could speak at all, much less make poetic conceptualizations about your birthday. In fact, I was obsessing on what it would be in the big birthday book. You almost made the day of eccentricity along with Emily D, but you passed that over for the day of abandon. Total freedom same sign as Chanade O'Connor, Mary Queen of Scots, Jim Morrison, Flip Wilson, Alter Ego, Geraldine, whom your grandmother of the same name was reported to have loved, and others of wild nature unable to be contained. You were also born in the year of the horse, and as a Sagittarius you are a double horsey ready to run and travel free, but I hope you'll stick close by me for a while, because I love it.  And even though last month you supposedly finally figured out we are separate bodies and identities, you were your own self from the beginning, a focused discerning light, so calm for a baby. You did cry, though not as often as most we hear, and you did not have that choler or colic, but are of the undeniably sweet disposition. Anyway, as I was saying, I love you close by me, and when we are together in bed, you nursing in the crook of my arm, I can imagine you are still attached to me as you were in the inside, and your fine, smooth body, exceptionally fat, fair, and pure, is covered with fine patina of sweat. It is like you are still swimming in me.  One time when you were kicking up a storm so strong in Vienna, when I was walking one night to catch the tram to meet your father, you kicked such a complex rhythm that I had to stop walking in order to process the polyphony. I noticed these couplets line are growing longer and longer. It's because I have so much to say to you and the headlong rush seems the way to go if I am to attempt to catch up in all the varied strands of thought and experience that have transpired since your birth, making everything richer and more layered. I even had the feeling yesterday that you had always been here, even though you've only been outside a little over half a year. Maybe you were always there in eternity or infinity. You met Destiny on the street the other day.  And I said, Destiny, meet reality. And reality, meet destiny. And Destiny's mother laughed and told her friend how I looked around when she was calling out down Eighth Avenue, Destiny, destiny. So many little happenings since you were born. And before now that art and life seem even more enmeshed, think I'll go take a swim with you and your dad now in the L shaped pool with you and your bright pink swim diapers given to us unused by Stella. So many lovely hand me downs and new things too. I had to work up to that one.  I'll just do a few from this, and India is going to read some of the three hundred and fifteen project that she worked on. I wanted to read a piece of mine. It's an interesting project that Bernadette Mayer is another inspiration to us that Laney referenced earlier, and she's also a way that Stein comes into this generation. She taught us a lot about Gertrude Stein's sort of conceptual ideas with the sentence and her play. But the three hundred fifteen project is a bunch of people writing every August at three hundred fifteen in the morning.  I did it the very first year, I think it was ' ninety three or something like that. So if you ever want to join it, there's a website I think you can join up to do the three hundred fifteen project. But this is the only thing I saved from this book out of that, and then the whole thing was published in their place. But this is Definitions at three hundred fifteen. Poetry. A condensed form of food and time. Voice. My speech, babe. Brain. A reign in B. Boat. Toybot. A TED DET.  Sun in a squeegee. Modesty. The ruined package. Discourse. Talking fancy without much to drink. And I'll just do a very short sample from this new book. All right, before I forget, the Tinder Buttons books that are here tonight. Indias and Laney's. I wanted, you know, if you want to pick them up, we'll give a special deal tonight. So please, they're usually like eleven dollars ninety five cents. We'll give them two dollars for ten bucks or seven dollars each if you want just one. So I want to say that before I forget. We brought them down from New York.  with you and put them on your bedside. Another thing I like about, you know, Laney's work is the work with the botanical language, the language of flowers and of seeds and botany and science. And I did a lot of work with that. And then, of course, I was attracted to India's work with sleep as a sort of transformative state. And we both use those in our work. So I think that's one of the common threads. And I wanted to read two poems that sort of link up with that. So Encyclopaedia Botanica, or this is sort of a title of my book, or a mother to be's book of meltdowns.  anticipation and scientific renderings of organic and theoretical forms, such as the way flowers lie in the bud. A permutational cento of centos, consisting of painful ensuflations, multiple estivations, the calculus of various inflorescence, my naive set theories as unordered pairs, vibratory odes in all manner of cross pollinating color, illumined spores, and how they grow in corkscrew contortion, all imbued with entire new electric libraries of the body. Herein find random factors of the strange attraction to hard science, but also to soften it.  Previously failed materials and pickup works, illuminated maps of misreading, specifically a trace study of my own peculiar vocabulary living in the dictionary.
Browne-Laynie_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Brown-University_3-11-09	0.0	681.2	 Fingers grasped the first magnificence, gold interior of turquoise eye, still splayed, cold, changed incomprehensibly, late within, and hidden by the circle, the vow. Where art thought this spelt upon the hand be of the handmaiden, ghosts which fathomed, blinked, and bothered no more? Thus she begins, worse soothsayer.  Say little said, little say sooth sawed, or meaning to rewrite perplexity, possibly sworn to such the further fathoms of fabric swung, so possibly sleep, so possibly supporting the dangers of small fish placed accordingly in our pockets, we set out. And nowhere beginning tapestries, early morning dedications, a salve, weather maps broken. The relaxing figure draws a window pane easily with deft blue finger. The glass trembles.  The interrupted moment returns, embeds itself in skin. Palimpsest. Put the rock crystal in the sun and put the warm crystal on your eyes if they are blurry. The rock crystal eliminates the malicious fluids of unshed tears. Its natural art originates from water. Lighten my eyes, pleads the psalmist.  I sleep. Interlude. I dress my vowels oddly, peaks covered with garments of birch. Simplicity is an even fitting, a diagram of snow to define white, not trembling linen maiden, no pleated coif inherited, but one deliberately unbound.  Even now? Gold from circlet. Interior from chamber. Speech requires an opaque mistress whose steps appear mineral. A winter song closeted by staves. Sentencing. There is more waiting than one thought possible, began the female sentence. But how then must one proceed? Simply, replied the pale.  One proceeds, one need not wait. Not wait? asked the sentence. All will befall, replied the pear, and none will be forsaken. One may lose, regardless of gazing lookingly. This episode of yours is hardly less meek, it will befall everyone. But when the sentence gazed into the pear and saw herself reflected in its golden skin, she knew otherwise. How, then, can my befallen state be the same as any other? When one has just heard brave news, replied the pear, that one has no idea.  has been granted a wish, the sentence must contrive to complete itself. Confound the one who first distinguished the hours, continued the sentence. Thus my body becomes a question. Who assembled the first sundial whose shadows plague these letters to no end? So the second part of this book is called Tales in Miniature and they are.  Tails constructed of three words. So you get to imagine the rest. Furrow, tigrish, till, woodcutters, pebble, prattle, banister, water, weight.  Letter. Falcon. Hidden. Purpled. Snarl. Lilt. And then the last section is an associative dictionary called Festoon Dictionary, which is not alphabetical. So the book moves from tales that are roughly about.  to the three word tails to then the tail within each word. So I'll read a few dictionary entries. Checkered. Careful in the observance of quickfire and ceremony. Superstition. The spine of a herring with ribs extended. Hoof. The quality of being strident. We struck the main road impetuously.  Plough, antidote to stiffening. Utter, unknown sound of certainty. Crimson, that portion of the floor of a room on which a fire stands. Barricade, to please to such a degree as to smother resistance. Spiracle, writing in the walls.  Ether, being such in name only. Canary, a gown like outer garment with forelimbs modified to wings. Seed, a group of letters representing a word. Glade, a temporary stillness. Moonwise, a long, slender, slender, downward curved bill. Sleep, to fasten.  Inaction. Star written in superscript, retinal rising. And then I'm going to read from probably my newest project, which is called Scorpion Odes. And I was investigating the natural and literary history of the scorpion, also as a metaphor for various cultural maladies at the moment.  Work in progress. So, starting with two quotations. From Shakespeare, some private scorpion do you pontificate? And from Shelley, a mind that broods over guilty woes is like a scorpion girt by fire. Scorpion Ode. I prayed the dictionary. I asked pardon.  of dream, I feared scorpions in their silence, and walked each morning into the rising mountain. I vowed not to become the nullifying silence, but to nullify the other paralysis being born, to speak with the elevated precision of silence, from the marrow of consciousness, the living aspect of which appears solid, but isn't complete until we have left the word, the mountain, and the scorpionic premises.  Departure. I speak from another vantage, though it is not mine. Nothing is anyone's, formally speaking. Even if you walk along this peculiarity of gasping ordination, a mime is more akin to the moment. If you could hold it and walk alongside me, I'd be somewhere, driven to the particle within miniature fluctuations of light, not visible light, but what turns you and pulls you from your bed on a morning is such you would rather not be bitten.  Wakeful refraction is the missing testimony of leaving. Where are you going and how will you get there? Scorpion Ode. I watched the reader read, and the squares upon calendars looked back upon me. I tried to read from the book, but even magnified, I could not see it. What scurried beneath the book, I cannot say. I hung upon the walls, not regret, but a ship below a bat.  Open.
Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21	0.0	373.94	 A fascinating thing, and now we both had a chance to read more literary history. So we know going back to Blake, of course, who was such an outsider and printed and engraved, created his own engraving techniques, his own books. But most poets exist within, you know, micro networks of publishers or bookstores that publish their work and that circulate to other poets. And you could sort of trace what those networks are. And I'm not saying network in a contemporary bureaucratic sense. You could trace those connections by looking at the where the books.  Absolutely. Who publishes that? Yeah. So you're really the center center. Yeah. So while you might have found it, I could imagine, quite difficult, 'cause distribution is always a very difficult and unrewarding thing, nonetheless, you learned a lot about what was going on, how things were going on. Well, yeah, I did, and I but I was also I was traveling a bit and visiting libraries, and that's how I was selling the books that we were distributing. People rarely bought anything from a list that we would send out, but if I would go around and visit people in special collections libraries, they would invariably buy many things, maybe. So that's when you got started.  with your relationship with special collections and libraries. That started the distribution. But then I realized when I did the cage book, I knew that if I went around and showed it to people that I would be able to sell this. And so it made it possible having that end point, that end user point in mind. And I'd met a lot of people by then. In the early eighties, I came out and attended the something called Rare Book School. That was a summer program at Columbia University. This was filled with all kinds of languages.  librarians from around the country and elsewhere, studying aspects of rare books. And that was very useful in beginning to meet people, some of them I still know now, all this time. And they were at the beginning of their career then as well. And it may be unfair or a stereotype, but a lot of people involved with rare books for sure, but fine press printing apart from you and Charles Alexander and a few others, and leaving aside the cheaper use of letterpress by Burning Deck or Tumba and others, wouldn't have been interesting contemporary, especially not radical.  innovative poetry they would publish known works and it would be about the way in which those works were printed and set or more conventional writing. So you are combining very radical poetic content, radical in the sense of unconventional and contemporary versus more traditional right work. Yeah, that's why I wanted my interest in the books that we were distributing was limited to the physical aspects of the work.  And the nothing wrong with the content. I don't want to go I love Moby Dick. Yeah, Jeremy. I've sat by famously. Probably more than one. But one of the people you mentioned, it's a beautiful thing to behold, isn't it? Absolutely. It's still not the same as doing a John Cage book, or Jane Brackage book. It's a different kind of thing. But what I'm interested in dwelling on that for a second is the syncretic, which is so important to me in poetics. In your case, the syncretism has to do with combining aspects of a very traditional fine press printing.  knowledge of antiquarian books with this very different content that you put into that. Because a lot of us, I mean, think about stuff that I was publishing as kind of a non publisher, publisher, but still, I mean, we type stuff and we xeroxed it. It was fine. And it has a nice quality to it, and I'm all for it, but a lot more people doing the kind of stuff that I was doing with desktop and the rest. A lot less people, even if they wanted to, could have done what you did because they just wouldn't have known how to do it. Yeah, yeah, but no, it wasn't, you're right, you're right.  There weren't many models really. I mean, Parisable Press published a lot of people, Paul Blackburn, Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley. But he did it in a one, he did it in his way. It was a very perfect way. It was very much in the fine printing tradition. And I think that what Granary does, did and does was to push it further and try to find a proper relationship between all of the materials of the object.  So this becomes a kind of a crossover into what you could call artist books. Now, at what point did you begin to see your work at Granary as the publisher of artist books? Because we haven't used that term up until now, right? We're talking about poetry, fine press, but yet if you're looking at it from twenty twenty one, the first thing that one would say about Granary books, though not the only thing, is that you did artist books. Yeah, I would say that I was aware of artist books in many of the versions of ways of defining them.  That from the so called democratic multiple Rouchet and Sol de Witt and others, the kinds of books you'll see at Printed Matter, as well as poet painter collaborations or
Conrad-CA_Complete-Reading_War-and-Peace-3_Peace-on-A_11-2007	0.0	436.01	 Arrows and arrows, same damn deal. Kissing eliminates fusion of agitation and dreams. Folded in the days, these surprising moments with you. Look under pain and find me. Of course I still love you. I'm glad you asked. Put on your hunting boots and look at my antlers. I'm a deer. I'm a deer. All right. Oh, that was nice. Oh, that's your phone? Okay. Oh, okay. I sound like a deer dying.  Say it with green paint for the comfort and healing of their wounds. Written after eating only green foods for a day while under the influence of green nail polish on my middle fingers. Not until we're all protected, he said. Not until we're all unprotected, I said. Descent of magnets we come to bank ourselves against. The tomb radiates life without pause. Yes, that's your insurance agent overhead in first class. Cash webs form, water sends instinct home. A switch inside the queen's body stops producing workers to send out a queen.  Empire wants a raise. Right on walls, right on courthouse sidewalks, right on every single mirror you can find, I make holes in Iraqi families every time I pay my taxes. All these centuries later the occupation still unwittingly shapes the resistance. Eruptions at night we only hear to know. Burying dead batteries under the green flag of the desert. It's all quite stunning sealed under reactions. Everybody needs a lover in wartime. Fuck for the dead.  Fuck and love fucking for the dead. After the latest body count, fuck and fuck and fuck the prey are fucking. Run onto the street screaming death down. Terrible vacancies for either hand. Settle into time, settle into missing time, flat on the grass, smoking hash until the butterfly. Hyperapathy? I'm telling you this only once. You're outside your jurisdiction.  In World War one, the number of people who died that were civilians in the war, they estimated it to be ten percent. In World War two, civilian deaths was estimated at fifty percent. In the Vietnam War, civilian deaths was estimated at seventy five percent. With our war now in Iraq, the estimated civilian deaths are ninety percent. And I just recently heard this young man who went AWOL after being in Baghdad for a year in the maritime.  And he was talking at the Quakers meeting house in Philadelphia, and he just sort of glazed over this little topic about all these men that he met in Germany, where he was stationed, who were expatriates. And I asked him at the Q and A to tell us more about that. There are hundreds of American GI's, Iraq war veterans, who come back here after their tour of duty, and they lose it in shopping malls, or grocery stores, or movie theaters, or restaurants that we're not talking about what's going on.  We're not talking about what we're doing. We're not talking about what they've been going through. And they go back to Germany, and they marry German women, and they vow to never come back here again. And it's something I think we need to think about. I think about it a lot. This is by Adonis. He's one of the Tamuzi poets from Beirut. It's just a little poem that I wanted to read. It's called The Beginning of Naming. We have named every place in the name of the sword, and have started to build a moon from chalk, forests from severed heads, and the stars from a night of cadavers.  We have created a kingdom of mere things. So I just wanted to read one more thing, and then I'm finished. This is from a new project that I'm working on. It's a collaboration with Erica Kaufman. I forgot to print out the maneuvers. We have three maneuvers to bring. She writes in Brooklyn, I write in Philadelphia at the same time, and I call her on her cell phone. I have a cell phone, so I call her from a payphone at noon, and then we exchange these two words. But the maneuvers are not this is not documentary poetry. The maneuvers are not the poem. They're just a sort of throwout.  And so the poems are our own, but we do share two words. But I meant to bring the maneuvers, but anyway, I'm just going to read this without them. So this is my poem from the beginning of the series. It's called Tattoos of America's Most Wanted on My Mind. Language is transportation. Reverse plummet from these ray pierced clouds. Watch for steeples, wires, and poles when reentering an upright day. Believe me, Levitation needs no believers waiting for that island to float out.  They know we love our eyes, the photographers. Deposit departed one's key. Listening for color gets us a natural swing. A tree is not a door frame, it's a fact, its own poetry. In the mulch, the root, where original pussy juice, where no one wears someone else's skin, trust this frog and mudslip concoction, stress on the slow, stress on the quiet. Born during the occupation, we'll name her little smothered heart. Hanging around the streets with their cameras and high balls, hoping we've been taking care of our eyes.  Gratitude is a privilege, art is a right. Anger never lost in translation. A blast of paperwork precedes a dead soldier returning home. When this war is over, tenderness will maintain the same distance. It's time to grow up, they'll tell you, when you're a disagreeable character. With everything you have, ignore them. I would rather live in constant disappointment than give my life to cynicism. A huge fuck you to old answers and other waterlogged filthy interpretations. Love has paced out winners long ago. Join, not hammer, just plying and ripping open ducts.

Passing along the way Of seamless parlors, pastures, plates in flight, Today becomes the day His goldfish thinking stands, among which Dial the last of the food, fuel o'er its night, Which, thanks for the money, in the park, the rose stood till land, Found the count of the world in its caves, a guava would. Bombings? Two moments, just. The second takes a safe lock, Street of red silk.  The term of the world is right away. Remember that firehouse angle closed against my chimes? Drilled. And a bleak light on the matter is the matter. Double. To morrow the raisins will be making their turns. I am merely to maintain the lead here. A hopeless handle for all takers. How to find where the scent comes loose? Birds hop over anyone's brain, perhaps taking. Glass, that's how that arrow does its leveling. I have to make five or six, or there might be too much food a day, and smiled at the stolen steaks. Hear me, lady, be a taste of it yourself, and then lend hold of the tool, a fact of second duck.  Too much height hard to handle, Decibel. Then the home street fled open, walked himself loose from her gown, over, that's the way of the sample, turpentine, but no takers down are known, my fingers spine. The world of food gets traded for all the rest of the worlds, arrows to be looked and locked if the ducks have their say. You are, after all, with many open lines, a battle for the handles of many takers. Then there's a second light on thicker desserts, behind which the jury rehearsed, I may say, safe and sharp, rods at dawn at the top of a trunkful of birds.  Red people in those mountains, a sharp firing of light on the obliquer deserts. I opened that street with my sharp picture. Why not? It's a carved world. Blessing. Ringlock told Wake, those ducks were someone's brain. The trees, once out front, are in your bedroom. Lug the vacuum. It don't quite matter, that ruby of a world's scissors. Sort of how it did that to hide? Aeroplanes in trouble turned off at his desert. A wasted pocket tap touched again today. A three inch plane with six aboard. Extremely difficult for the thicker drugs.  Sickle for eleven, no better than a piercing buzz. That key emits the squatter music. Four old hands ready to roll. The day, the room is a sugar splay. The chairman of tormidons, his wings, just like the news. Every scrape that monk loves, outside of his clothes, his overlap and dew mist, slice. How could we be? Carbar, in my sense of it, is laugh to the slaughter, holistic peals, drills, the sliding cracks that came away loose in my fire bend, the handle of my pocket. The other meant surgery. Pictures requiring radio of a teacher in a bus whose bird gone over the top, whose latch.  Do you continue to serve the hot light? Waste in making its turns, salads, tamps. My fingers on the world's spines at last ticket the ruby troubles en masse. Always it is reddish at the tops of the sharper mountains. I have no trouble. A handle on that tree came away like news. It was impenetrable to maintain. It was last to be, or watch four hours of electric fish. Suppose it made safe the caves all locked away, bite. A vacuum is wasted aboard. I wanted to get the scissors fired up here.  turn, thick ruby on the fire escape. I'm not surprised at the wheat in the sky. It's part, this knock, from her gown, the handle taken down. The say which we have had, touch? Ya, down with all their ways. I am merely perhaps to find the same looked, locked lines, flea cap, modest pate, light on making their turns. What in the world if the ducks had fingers? Mountains in the street. Right, the matter of airplane flare, surgery cracked and was gone, ducks in ruby trouble. Here my tool, four old squats, good morning. Behind which dawn at the top of those mountains a street,  blessing the raisins there with turpentine. The duck had not set foot on their property. Lugs, tolls, loose in the pictures of any beaches, a pumpable horn. Double term at the same mill, then the news of any sugar in my fire. Other ways to say, which top's so sharp? As if we're there, those birds, I mean. Trouble, after all, takes takers. The matter with airplanes that they won't hide. Mountains rose at that old firehouse, lady all ears at the angel's stakes, maternal room for the difficult buzzing, for the lending I came out of log rolling, hiding, why not a wasted wing?  And roll and rushing around, table map dangling. I opened those mountains, world. A mighty sharp ring means too much food, yourself and the fact of home. Perhaps I have smiled. The truckers rehearsed at the firing of the light. Audre took a taste of duck, smiled and walked himself loose. I may say of birds, they won't. The day of a woman's way of food. Whew, lucky kneaders dialing in a blend of shoe makes witness of us all, even in this sort of vacuum. Nice of you to knock. Smelled a presence. Out front, it didn't quite matter.  things aboard, hands on their wings. Let's go out behind the beach and love in pockets. A sample result of birds with too much food. Vacuum failure.

He will absolutely not kick playing the body. Perhaps even to smell of the playing. Only he is permitted when necessary. The tiniest of thoughts and even if he was played by an actor, he should be played by an actor who's never acted before, who's always been more of an introverted type of guy than somebody who loves the limelight. He could be played by Steve McLaughlin, a six foot two young man with beautiful pink and white skin and long, thin muscles. He would try to make the live journal and the voice of his character, Christmas' sister, Easter, because of her interest in poetry in the play.  Through some of the work by the poets who are popular with girls of that age seventeen and chooses a line to start with from one of the poets. Then the poems pretty much write themselves. Steve chooses to use livejournal dot com for Easter's poems because it would have probably been the most popular site for something like it in two thousand three when he was still in junior high school. He starts to enjoy it quite a bit after the first few goes. There's something about playing the role of a physically adult adolescent girl which allows for a long forgotten enjoyment in the composition of emotional amateur poetry. Steve has written scores of these poems by now, sometimes losing track of the division between a parody of precocious sentiment and its reality.  Intelated for her live journal.

Transcript of a dream wherein Lily and I brutally murder an innocent repo man. You are the sound of a dragging angle in someone's femur. You are the sea biscuit of my ocean, a fresh sprig of herbs.  The mystery of my collection, breasts like Hershey's kisses, stomach like a vagina. To my dear dead wife. There was this dump out on the outskirts of town, and we were there. Piles of cars on the horizon. We were hiding from that man, the machine, the excavating mob. We call man, we call man. My wife was very beautiful in the film Days of Heaven, You Throve under the direction of Terence Malek. My wife, my wife, is a beastly dead rat, and how stacked. I hope there will be another girl living here when they find out about me to express a deep, deep, deep baby inside of me.  I want to mow your dull body hair. Then we found him. You hit him in the neck with a microphone stone and then I kicked him with my tongs. He pleaded in his appeals like a tiny Mickey or like a lawyer. We popped out his left eye with our clenches and you had to tell the world how, as a star, a star has mauled him for what he is, that cluster of knot for coming upon.

Darragh-Tina_Complete-Recording_Segue_Zinc-Bar_01-05-13	0.0	370.53	 Lib Erty rings the doorbell at Gene Our Nation to discuss the results with a genetic counselor. When the door opens, she's surprised to find a room full of people dressed as crime scene investigators. A young woman in a white jumpsuit, with her forehead tattooed, I dream of genies, skateboards over to her. Just imagine a skateboard. Welcome. I'm Gal Corky. Are you here for your Burka? Welcome. I'm Gal Corky. Are you here for your Burka test result? Yes, I'm Lib Erty. And my doctor called to say that it was ready. Unfortunately, we just received a court order restraining us.  from releasing BERCA results until the test patent dispute is resolved. But I have good news for you. So you wouldn't have to come here for nothing. We ran an additional test at no extra charge and you don't have any mutations in your human rights gene. Gal was spinning around and doing a high five. Did you say human rights? That's a political doctrine, not a medical condition. That's so twentieth century. The new scanners we have can recognize inherent dignity. Lib thinks Gal is joking. And the gene for evil has a little black.  Hmm, there are tons of mutations for the human rights gene. There may be one for scratchy facial hair. Lib, eggs are on. So let's say I take a direct hit from the big scratch. I won't be so bad because you've got my back with your skateboard. Here at Gene Our Nation, we pride ourselves at being the soul of wit. So hanging out with horror can be experienced as good times. Lib, no longer laughing. Let me get this straight. If I think evil is all taken care of with a genetic test.  You won't notice that I can be incarcerated for an indefinite period of time without a lawyer, secretly flown to another country and tortured? Well, if you travel to a developing country, we do recommend keeping this test result with your passport. But I'm without human rights here in America. I could be picked up today as I leave this building and never be seen again. No way. Yes way. Liberty pulls a Washington Post newspaper article from her pocket and hands it to Gal. I carry this with me at all times to remind me of all the rights I don't have. Something as serious as the indefinite detention of citizens.  Becoming law was on page A six instead of on the front page. Well, at least it wasn't in the style section. Well, let's hope that the clinical trials for the human rights mutation drugs are successful, ASAP. Clinical trials? Yep, the pharmaceutical companies are all over this one. They need to get some new drugs in the pipeline because their top money makers are going generic. Don't worry, the National Institutes of Health Scientists are making sure the trials are the creme de la creme of research. Lube has an aha moment. So, US taxpayers are funding this?  Right? Terrific. By law, publicly funded clinical trial participants must be given standard of care for whatever is being tested. So, for a human rights drug, that means they'd get universal health care. Then, when the trials are completed, we'll use the march in rights of the Bai Dole Act to get the money to restructure our health system. Bai Dole? Is that some sort of welfare scam? Yeah, you could say that. For the drug companies, the government gives our money to researchers to test and patent drugs. Then, the pharmaceutical companies license them and make billions of dollars on our dime. But there's a little known clause.  law that says if the public safety is at risk, the government can march in and take back the patents. Deepening her voice. Universal healthcare for the public safety. It will be so cool when health is finally a human right. Well, health isn't a right. It's something we do. If we think of health as a right, then it's something we're owed, which by definition means it's something someone else has. In this case, that would be the healthcare corporations of Big Pharma. We don't want that. But we can take back our healthcare system and rebuild it as a cooperative enterprise with the profits from the patents on taxpayer funded research.  It'd be fun to do when we march in. Can I have my iPod? You bet, well, I'll be on a roll. Okay, and the, all right, so the final one, Erica will do with me. It's called a Hun by any other name, and there's a little handout that goes with it. Right, because there's a sing along at the end. Okay, a Hun by any other name. Levent and Quixie.  Best buds since attending fourth grade together at Petapsco Elementary School in Baltimore are down in the dumps. Their usual plans for attending a street festival celebrating Huns. Working class women from Baltimore, usually depicted with beehive hairdos and leopard skin capri pants, are on hold after hearing that the festival's organizer has trademarked the expression Hun. Dismayed, they wander into a coffee shop. Levent. I'm so upset by this Hun business because it reminds me of work. What's our brand? What does this do to our brand? Get your brand on. My brand was an honor student at Petapsco Elementary School.  Donuts for brand equity. What would brand do? I made my money the old fashioned way. I branded it. I've never met a brand I didn't. Quixie. Stop already.

On the surface, he is dealing with the nature of the mystical or the religious. But beneath that, and almost certainly unintentionally, the broader question being asked is, why do we adjectivize at all? How do we come to say that of that? It is in the context of this that he asks, quote, But could I not just as well ask, when I see someone killed, is it simply what I see that makes an impression on me, or does this come with the hypothesis that someone is being killed here? You can see that I leave him with credit for his double interrogative, but I can't help it.  but wonder what it is that makes him experience the difference between what he sees and what he thinks he sees. Now I'll read some newer poems. And some of these were published in Abacus that David mentioned, that was the title of the collection of which was called Riot Now. Some of these I read recently at Saint Mark's.  And some of them I didn't. But again, and like Michael, because tomorrow's Valentine's Day, I tried to pull together some that had something of that about them. And I'm going to read those first. And then if time permits, perhaps I'll read some of the others that have some other things about them. I want to touch your little nipples and put my hand between between your legs. I want to hold you from behind so that your ass feels my cockhead. In the afternoon, I fondly kiss her. And in the evening, repeatedly kiss her neck. I kiss your eyes and all over. I wouldn't kiss anyone.  Instead. In the evening I penetrate her. In the morning we almost go to bed. Desire, affection with an occasion, really. Desire, affection with a location. You strung an incredible tent across an abyss. There is no connection between a cardinal and the infinite number. I want to habituate the filthy poor of this and every other world for no reason. I love you. The world is lewd with your little street tragedies. You always make me think of licking the back of the neck of the proletariat. We'll see if you can get by with this.  Half of what you think you need. It's lust, we'll call it lust. Her poignant breasts, here damaged by description, a vulva. Along the top of the hill the row of shining tepees were one by one set light to. Emboldened by love, so to speak, we came away in her hands. Her eyes took me with arithmetic accuracy, but this is years later in old San Juan, in the heat of the night. Mary Angelica, it is with great pleasure that I introduce you to Reuben and to Miriam. I remember Miriam and Reuben like it was yesterday.  Reuben and Miriam like it was yesterday. Only misses Duke approves. I spend a lot of time thinking about the difference between a zero set and a null set, and I come up with you, shaded African of the Islands. This one has a title, the title is The Idea of Order at Lizard Key. There are a lot of people out there who believe in a God without rightly knowing why. It must be because of the museums. Compare that with some lazy little quiet afternoon bombshell sex in the byways of Queens. That's what I was thinking about tonight.  Lizard Key is a place in a I forget whether it's a novel or a story by JG Ballard. Next time I read here, I'll read that story. To see you in other places, with other men's looks on her faces, I sent her in other places, in other pieces, with other men's licks on your creases. You have an urge to live, I wouldn't think to interrupt. No one comes alone to my house. Comme je taim je taim beaucoup. Je taim je taim je taim too. It's kind of hard to understand if you don't look at it, and especially if you have to rely on my ability.  pronounced French words. But it's obviously come ju tem ju tem book, how I love you, how much I love you very much, or something like that. And then there's kind of a play on words between tam, ti posh, va, ime, meaning you that I love, or whatever, and ju tan, or time. So it's kind of how I love you, I love you very much, I time, I time, and I time too. An hour of this is worth a hundred days. The weather the way it is and thoughts of you the way you are are enough. Your neck is beautiful. The glazed eyes of the happy municipal.  Turn me on, onto you, the long blond alleys. I'll always feel this way about you. Worry your little head about me, Dusty, or if I douche my head where the stars were, but that isn't you. The time when every ounce of my body weighs as much as every other ounce of my body, it's then I think most of you. A series of Valentine's poems wouldn't be complete without some mention of this lustrous society that we live in. This is called capitalism.  The fruits and vegetables are poorer alongside the poorer avenues to the east, but that's okay. There's more cheap beer. The dirt in the glass looks inharmonious and bleak. See what I mean about the adjectives? To anyone who can or cannot see. If it has not been the program, then it has always been the effect of the writing of the Koran, Bible, Torah, and their near accomplices to limit human nature and to do so absolutely. It has similarly been the effect of secular, are there any literatures to repress human nature.  and to have done so by instilling examples of thought and action always somehow so much less than what we might achieve. By appearing to be external to us, literature has been a fabric of pegs against which we jolt, of artificial limits. In the post prehistoric period, in other words, at the beginning of the historic, there may have been a writing of content and event of actions. Nature is the emblem we would pick from that. The civilization of the languages was primarily a process of the opening up of them to the loads of the concepts of time.  in the myths of romantic disillusionment, a period which is just now flapping its flatulent last. Industry was its latest, large motif. The writing and arts which are now starting, lapping the romantic as it were, reflect the beginning of the new age to which everything will be absent, in which pretence will be the genre of everything including desires. Again, space will be the first to empty, time right behind. We're talking about two, three lifetimes.
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77	0.0	343.0	 The beats were almost always serious too, I remember. That got me into the literary quarterlies and through the Iowa Writers Workshop and helped me understand my own dark corners and sharp angles. And then one day I realized how much of what I was reading and often admiring going on around me in the poetry world was a kind of picking of scabs and flashing the open sores and wounds as badges and credentials. And how O'Hara totally sidestepped that contemporary tendency by tone and choice of vocabulary that cut through the hopelessness of so much poetry and replaced it with the joy of writing the poem. What a simple but wonderful revelation. The joy of writing it down. That was what that was what it was.  Suddenly seemed to be about in a way that made me think of all I had heard the painters of his time were trying to do, get across the action of the creating rather than the product that was so finished that showed no signs of the activity, the energy and spirit of the actual work that went into it. O'Hara's poems were little excursions into the act of writing poems, with a kind of mindset that keeps us trying sex with strangers again and again. The hope that this time is going to be great, give us much pleasure, and satisfy a lot of frustration, and totally annul the boring, horrible, deadening, killing, in fact, effects of living the modern urban existence. I think I rewrote that phrase. But I still couldn't reconcile that.  achievement with the personal references, though they were becoming more and more familiar and thus less and less elitist, though still somewhat obscure. Then one day I was teaching contemporary poetry to a college class and talking about a poem of O'Hara's, I think it was a step away from them, after talking about the poem's steps and how it overcame the sadness of love's ending or going sour amid the big city grind, and in discussing how it did this, mostly through the structure of the poem, because by then I'd learned so much about movement and rhythm and construction, I could see how well made O'Hara's poems are despite, or maybe because of their conversational flow, and in the process of explaining why the poems were good from a strategic and structural point of view, because they accomplished this message of hope in the face of contemporary despair and despite well founded reasons for love.  lamenting our condition or his condition in the specific circumstances of the poem, and did it through technical agility so refined the surface ambience of ease and a kind of glib grace was hardly disturbed. Suddenly I caught myself starting to cry, and I never cried back then. In fact, except for a short interlude of about a year of weepiness, I never cried, period, except over old movies and musicals, and it was that heartstring O'Hara had suddenly plucked in me through his poetry that sang so naturally and yet skilfully of overcoming stupidity and tediousness of so much of life. The true romantic, only without the pretentious and really elitist self conscious and self satisfied seriousness of the walking wounds of contemporary poetry, because by mocking the tone of the real and original Romanesque.  Romantics partly through the use of quotation marks in italics, which is a sort of what campy dialogue often depends on, as others have pointed out, it means talking in italics. And exclamation points and exclamations, oh, he was making himself vulnerable to a two edged scalpel unlike the confessional poets and others of his contemporaries, even the seemingly honest beats who always exposed themselves in ways that demanded applause or appreciation for the courage of the exposure or the extent of self destruction the exposure caused or exposed, etcetera. But not O'Hara, his defenses were the shrewdest and toughest of all because they weren't defensive at all, but appeared to be all offensive, only the offensive was mounted against his own and others' defensiveness.  He could be attacked for elitism when, in fact, he's our most democratic poet since Whitman, bringing that tradition full circle by reversing Whitman's posing as the common man, brother to all, which reduced everyone to the level of anonymity that Whitman's poems ensured would never really be his fate, so he could afford it. I'm talking about the pose, which perhaps became a reality much the way Ginsburg seems to have, but which is not the poetry, because Whitman's poetry is often wonderful and amazing, and very much more the source of much that is associated with O'Hara in the New York School than many of the French writers constantly attributed with having influenced the New York scene. Although O'Hara is also sort of a Baudelaire in reverse, making the most of the worst of Baudelaire's pessimistic predictions about urban existence by preserving the poet.  of perceptions and emotionalisms the city scene can generate. But instead O'Hara elevates everyone to the level and attentive familiarity of stars, throwing in the names of personal friends alongside those of personal heroes and famous and world renowned producers and creators of the culture that has come to be ours, and which he defined before most of us and with the clarity of the lyrics of a Hollywood musical or a Madison Avenue ad, yet with all the subtlety and imaginative exuberance of a great wit and passionate lover. What an incredibly seductive combination for a poet. His poems are sexy. The language is often intimate, the images voluptuous and often exotic, the energy seemingly endless, and the point usually reassuring and flattering, and with just enough elusive connections to make us.  We want to put out the time and energy to make ourselves as attractively intelligent and perceptive and experienced and in the know as the poems assume we are. He refused to accept an audience that was not as good as he was and in that way included us all in the community of friends he admired and addressed and referred to along with the proper names and familiar rhythms of the most ordinary people and things. All of which he incorporated into descriptions and narratives that included the proper names and rhythms of the most extraordinary things. The rest of us are only now, years after the poems were written, getting hip to and how well they fit and work and complete the artistry of O'Hara's genius. He helped me realize that the reason I wrote poems was often simply because the rush, the feeling that accompanied the writing of the poem.  that when it seemed to be coming out good, couldn't be duplicated anywhere else. It wasn't a substitute for anything else, going to bed with someone beautiful and tough, or eating a delicious and totally satisfying meal, or outwitting a horribly abusive competitive Cretan in conversation. And it wasn't a gruelling act of anguish and pain getting in touch with all the crabbed secrets of the psyche and exposing them to the well organized and systematic scrutiny of some poetic form or strategy. No.

The poem must preserve a place to remain in what is not real. The poem must be an active force in a universe that is heterogeneous, however real. So that was the whole. And now I'm going to read you some notes.  My collaboration with CA Conrad. And then we will read the poems that we wrote based on this somatic exercise called Arthur Echo. Somatic exercises are this wonderful form that Conrad has single handedly invented and extended through a blog that he keeps called The Somatic Exercises Poetry Blog, which if you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth reading and keeping up with.  Echo Arthur. While house sitting for friends in Philadelphia, we collaborated on the following somatic exercise, playing Arthur Russell's CV World of Echo on repeat on all five floors of the house. We moved from floor to floor from nine AM to nine PM, taking scheduled breaks for food, conversation, and checking in for further fine tuning of the somatic maneuvers. Basement. Windows covered. Pitch black.  A small boom box plays CD on repeat with bass controls set to maximum. A white candle to light when sitting down. Blow out when leaving. The sink beside the table to slowly drip water on one hand while taking notes with the other. First floor. CD on stereo with balanced equalizer settings. All shades open. A chair sits by the front door. Open mail slot to peer at passing feet on the sidewalk. Every other page of notes should be nouns only.  Nouns. Second floor. CD on small CD on small stereo. Volume low. Computer set to show videos of Arthur Russell and his cello. In bathroom the tub is filled with a mixture of water and jasmine flower infusion. Jasmine invokes the muses. Take notes sitting in a chair by the tub while feet soak in the jasmine infusion. Third floor. CD on large stereo. Volume high. Treble adjusted to maximum. Books on alchemy sit at the desk.  by the window. Take notes. Upper loft. CD on third floor stereo carries up to the loft. At the end of the bed, facing the window, which looks over the Philadelphia tree tops and skyline. There are tarot cards and binoculars on the bed to better see the world. Take many notes. Last winter, I had the pleasure of composing a somatic exercise with my friend CA Conrad. Our exercise was based on downtown New York City cellist Arthur Russell.  Russell's masterpiece, World of Echo. It is difficult to describe Russell's World of Echo for anyone who hasn't heard it before. It has a rare spiritual quality, which issues from Russell's songwriting, voice, and cello playing, but also from the production values of the album. Perhaps the following passage from Tim Lawrence's biography of Russell, Hold on to your dreams, makes palpable Russell's subtle, accidental studio processes. During these sessions it became standard for Arthur to splice together separate tapes, and he would regularly grab a track from one tape and fly it into the multitrack of another while his envelope.  looking engineer tried to stay calm. We would be mixing on a piece of tape and I would see the splice go by, recalls Eric Lestrand. It was all very confusing. I could never really tell what we were working on until it was done. The ghostly accidents that arose from Arthur's insistence that they rerecord over old tape became an integral part of the sonic fabric. At one point, Conrad told me that he used the album to heal a knee injury that he had suffered. Russell was trained foremost as a musician and only afterwards as a Buddhist.  The healing powers of this music I can only imagine come from the confluence of these two disciplines. For our exercise, Conrad and I decided to have Russell's album playing on four different stereos throughout a five story house for a twelve hour duration. twelve hours is a long time to do anything, and especially to listen to an album tripoli on repeat. Among the constraints I recall imposing upon myself, many had to do with memory, trying to forget the last line I had written before continuing, interrupting myself midline, then picking up with the line again. These exercises in attention and discussion.  Abstraction I felt were true to Russell's music, so was a certain circularity that the exercises were trying to induce amidst interruption and disjunction. We also spent much of the nine hours improvising lines with a set of books I brought with me from New York City to Philadelphia, many of which were of a wholly metaphysical or medical import. Among these books include the writings of Henry Corman and his acolyte Christian Janvet, Oliver Saxe's Seeing Voices, Maurice Merlot Pointy's Selected Writings of Phenomenology, a collection of Gaelic folk tales and ballads.  Helen Keller's autobiography, Robert Kociak's Rhubarb, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead. I also remember reading a number of recently published poetry books, including Jules Boykoff's Courageous Hegemonic Love Potion. Russell, perhaps more than any other composer I have come into contact with, understood the importance of tuning his body and his mind as instruments coeval with his cello and the other instruments, drum machines, guitar, tabla, he would use throughout his compositions. Via studio production, Russell gained access to the occult.  otherworldly in ways similar to Conrad's use of his own body as a source of information and vision explored through the somatic exercise. And to conclude, I'd like to read my contribution to this little book which Conrad has a few copies of. I would bug him immediately. And Conrad will read his contribution later. Arthur Echo means inhabitation.  Depends.

You talk of color? O cosmological America, how well and with what geometry you teach your citizens. This is the first note from London.  As we go through Sussex, hills are round, bellies are the downs, pregnantly lovely, the rounds of them, no towns, the train passes shaking along the groove of the countryside. Travel to Newcastle is west of the moors, or east of the western moors. Between it all one goes, and everything is aye, and bonnie. Cold then, the note is Catnandoo, the outward point. How far the people see, in a naturally cold place, pots of tea, and a collection of fires.  So lovely she is, England, with her swollen bellies, all the way to the stone cardboard of Brighton, pale this winter, a paper jewel whose regent strolled. We got into one of those old coaches which has no access forward or back but is self contained, and it was strained being so enclosed and locked off by the speed of passage, alone, and even though she was my wife we flirted, almost we were in our confusion shy, scarcely believing our situation.  situation so sealed off. We considered, of course, making it then and there while moving, but settled for a quiet kiss when halfway through it, abruptly and to our amazement, we found ourselves in some small station smiling into the equally smiling face of a railway man idling on that minor and unremembered platform. Nonetheless, we were sober and chaste and slightly disappointed from thence to Croydon. This poem is entitled Thesis.  Only the illegitimate are beautiful, and only the good proliferate, only the illegitimate. O Akhlovik, only you are beautiful. Ah, Akhlovik, your main street is dead. Only the blemished are beautiful, only the deserted have life made of whole, unsurpassable night. Only Akhlovik is life inside life inside itself. They have gone who walk stiltedly on the legs of life.  All life is in the northern hemisphere turning around, the radicals of gross pain and great joy. The poles of pure life move into the circle of our north. O Aklavik, only the outcast and abandoned to the night are faultless. Only the faultless have fallen, only the fallen are the pure children of the sun. Only they move west, only they are expected in the virgin heat by those who wait intensely for the creatures from the east. Only Aklavik, our Aklavik, is known.  And lovely, always abandoned, always dark, whose warp is light. Simple fear compels Inuvik, her liquor store lifts the darkness by the rotation of a false summer. The children of the sun never go to Inuvik on bloody feet, half starved, or suffering the absolute intrusion of any food. O Aklavik, they vomit on your remote and insupportably obscure streets, which run antiseptically into the wilderness. And if black flies inhabit with the insistence of castanets the delta.  of Inuvik, in you, Aklavik, around you, Aklavik, they form a core and critical shell of inflexible lust. Only in the permafrost is the new home of the children, of the sun, in whose nakedness is the desire, not desire, in whose beauty is the flame of red permafrost, a thousand feet deep, in whose frail buildings the shudder of total winter, in whose misshapen sun the children bathe. OXFORD PART I. FORNICATION.  From Paddington, along one of the radials of London, which are the Oxford types, I asked myself, in the coach, the girl with the swell legs? Oxford has some of the richest and most beautiful women in the world, the Sunday Supplement said. The one from Argentina, the one from Portugal, a couple of straight American girls too clean to be real, rich, unquestionably. A Swedish girl, all weird countries, and variously do their kunts shine with radiant national deposits, a kind of enlightenment, if you will.  enlightened self interest, those care packages are kept at home until full grown, then sent abroad, wrapped in fur. We are the witness to all it is possible with such instruments as nations and mellifluous boxes to suck up the part of the world they may in any given period have wanted, and still want, and which they do want. Alias the good life this is their most rigid virtue, and not importantly education. They perpetuate their own kind in that way with old visions of Congolese Urania,  in the air, while the stolidly engaged back home cry out to boulevard, thinking that is where they are. The music of that desire is a richly orchestrated tapestry of instruction for their daughters here, teach them to ruin you, answer their questions, or because mass production allows a visual proximity and burns out the memory in men,

They've mapped these fears of seduction and pleasure onto the television, the game boy, the virtual world with its constant gratifications. I mean, it's not that there aren't issues with these things, but there's a kind of sense that, oh, you know, we'll put distance in there. And there's a kind of moral superiority in this critique that supposes that, you know, we should be didactic. You know, we should teach people how to not have pleasure with mass culture. Why? You know, that doesn't get at the systemic issues. It doesn't get at what is a problem here. And it takes for granted the idea that.  And somehow, as intellectuals, they're outside the culture. They're superior to it. Art, for them, is outside the ideologies. Resistance is our job. We are the moral conscience of the culture. And if you challenge this, as I have done on many occasions, and I have something I want to put forward, replace resistance. Resistance, said a critic recently to me when I gave a talk in New York, resistance will die hard. And he narrowed his eyes as he said it, and he hunched up his shoulders in a kind of defensive way. And they were very well fed and very well padded shoulders in a butter soft lamb leather coat. And I thought, yes, resistance will die hard.  especially among those with career investments in its stock. So as I was writing this piece, along came a press release from Joy Garnett. And it came through the email, and it had in it this brand new painting that she sent. And I thought it was so wet, it even looked wet on the screen. It was like, you know, just sort of wonderful. And the press release said, Joy Garnett continues her exploration of the malleability of instantly globalized images. She says she culls them and she archives them so that their context evaporates. And I thought, yes, this is so interesting. And she's like doing some, you know, remediation project and just working with them.  And it felt so much to me like the images in my book of real things, of things and persons observed, of photographs. And they're so striking that they sort of stop your day. And I could tell she was having that same experience, that these things just come at her and it stops her and she thinks, What an amazing image. But to really understand the image, she has to remake it. She has to repaint it. So again, I know that experience. I sit down. I sit down with images that come from the culture and I want to draw them again. So why is that? What is that doing? What is Joy doing? She absorbs, I absorb, we process, we remake these things.  Experience the images anew. So they're outside me. This is not outside her. They're grafted, they're scraped from that surface. You know, you really kind of, through that physical act of making, you interpret something and you somaticize it, it becomes part of you. And it's a kind of seeing through the hand and seeing through the body that goes on. So where does Joy Garnett get her idea of what she's doing? I mean, what does she think she's doing? What is her idea of making art? What is it to make, you know, poetry and text into a book? What does it mean to create aesthetic expressions? Am I really doing anything different, anything more self conscious than I was when I was sitting there digging?  to China to know anything more about making art than I do about making about digging a hole. I'm not really sure. I think cultural mythology invents itself in us anew over and over again in each generation. But let's make a comparison here. Let's compare Joy Garnett with Damien Hearst, right? I mean, what makes art different from other made things? How do we know we're looking at art and not just at something else? You know, here's the consumerist issue. It comes right to the fore here. You know, this is the high stakes gamble. This is high priced art. This is kitsch vulgar imagery. You know, this is the investment in branding for the.  Love of God, right? What God, Mammon? Is this an outrage? Or is it actually the work that demonstrates the importance of the relationship between capital and art in order to keep its status? I think this is an important and serious work. And I think it tells us a lot. I don't think you can bracket it out, quite the contrary. This is the highest, most highly prized work by a contemporary artist, even if he's the person who bought it from himself in part. The point is that it tells us something. It tells us he could. There's something very, very important about this in terms of how art as a concept is constructing itself culturally. How about Marikalmy? Another art, I love this guy.  Or is he just a product designer? Is this art or product? This is crazed imagery, deviant, but it finds its market in all kinds of products. Is this an outrage? Is this art? Is this commerce? Or is it the demonstration of the importance of marketing and promotion in the production of not just art, but the category of art? Okay, what is art that we're doing it? Or Phil Collins, this is, you know, from the video installation, the world won't listen. It's a wonderful installation. Seductive. It's beautiful. You know, Phil Collins is a Smith fan. He set up this project to go to three cities.  Istanbul and Jakarta. And he gathered fans of the Smiths, all ages, in those cities. He set up karaoke performances and he filmed them. And then he installed them in this beautiful video installation where you see the three cities simultaneously side by side going through the cuts on the Smiths album. And what do they show you, these wonderful figures? They show impossibilities, the impossibility of ever becoming what you aspire to.

The cat had no idea at all of what to do in traffic, so we put her in her best suit striped, and let her sing to her heart's content. My assistant requires that I show up to these events, and the kids spike their hair, wear beads, and think that they are hip cool, sliding around on gold cushions in front of a hello kitty fantasy scene of after life, in a perpetual neon glow. No seams, no cracks, flat surfaces, very hot color. That's what dreams are made of.  Sterner stuff. The brutalized compound, cruelty in the air, bitter life on the wing. The news knows no bounds. We are subject to reports. The book watches me read again and again, and tells everyone what I think about it. Nothing much. The grain was matted with blood, houses everywhere, crushed rock clogged their mouths, gaping open, lips like mashed potatoes, blood red sunset, again streaked with success. The campaign was almost over. Who would ever watch this again? four. Extropian Measures.  Excitement, heroic as dawn, shot through with early explosions, bargain hunted into swollen categories of solid waste, our products recycled on flatbed trucks brought in from the coast. These moral pleasures exceed the tax code. Mad and gentle, private as passion, the ten ton delivery rubble brushed to the surface, high madness, asphalt and asphalt and old Macadam, broken remnants of a lost tribe, skills embedded in the chunked material, cult knowledge now on sale, insipid commerce.  Fertile heat, challenging thought threatens to transform all challenges into an assault upon torpid flesh, pearls, jewels, dime store, stones, all upscale chains, spread with the usual precious metals, band of platinum, silver thread, the whole front window case of display items behind her head in an advertisement of the last weeks of summer.

Young and thin, in a machine made dress that could not adapt itself to her limbs, equally awkward, the stiff, cheap, white cloth and the pale, knock kneed legs limited in their range of movement by her inexperience of herself in the world. Fresh as a fucking flower, she stood there, her one hundred eighty dollars shirt thin and delicate as those emulsions filmed she fetishizes floats off their paper back, with tiny tweeds.  I make delicate compositions, pedal by small pedal, since when I was a child. I love nature, natural forms. I used to collect the cuttings that fell from my father's hand. My father, he was a botanist, a professor, and a gardener. And all this time her bare legs, thin and mottled, balanced precariously, even thin as she was, on the near invisible but very, very pointed, anxiously high heeled sandals, her long blood hair curled, who does that now? to lie on her shoulders, shining like her eyes.

She went all over the world, weeping histrionically, tears on my pillow far from home, her lean militant form arched against the bleached stones of the pilgrimage site in Tunisia, while her head drooped with the weight of unrequited martyrdom. Her tall limbs, charged with faith, strode along the road to Canterbury, leading the group of otherwise jovial companions, on the road in Rome and Rouen, Chartres and Amiens, on the path to remoter sites along the Black Sea and into the sacred places.  of the Eastern Church. At eighteen, she was pale, fierce, erect, prouder at twenty two, at thirty, an iron maiden, resolute and commanding, at thirty seven, an intimidating force, at sixty, severe and twisted. They snuck away from her one morning, tired of her haranguing speech and her love of God endlessly ruining their meal time chatter. Who wrote this? Well, the son wrote at first in cipher, but it was illegible and ungrammatical. So two levels of code are necessary to break. Who recovered this?

Well, she lived in daily expectation of canonization, and that's a lot of posture to uphold. Infidels, we captured moments and held them in our cheeks, storing the sensation, Oh, you can take anything to market here. Forms of realism, however, remain dull as gift shop sentiment, filling the space with older folks, each happier than the next to imagine owning a piece of their lives in such tamed and framed briflings.

The attack of the difficult spreadsheet. Whatever was guaranteeing solvency might have been the same thing over and over. Buzzer sound, ignore buzzer sound. All of them making big money, big plunder, smash and grab, a pretty ugly ferment that foretold the rest. And impossible to ignore, one would have thought, got squandered. There was no lack of telling, and the operable lexicon couldn't turn away, but it couldn't intervene either.  The houses were broken, the walls fell open. This is, of course, a pyramid scheme.

The stylized masculinity of the Noire does make a certain sense, mannered so beautifully under its scrim of attractive doubt, packing heat, it's almost comedy. In life, however, the firewall is discontinuous. It has already become rubble. Therefore, it is good to have compassion.  even if those were few and sometimes unavailable. If only time had not passed the way it did, dribbled in bits, us slogging through, oddly glad it's over, but think of that. It is good also to feel compassion inside the dream and out of it.

Every off chance is the index of what has already been articulated opening onto the same scrubby field. The master poet trembled. People watched him and wondered. He could barely articulate one shuddering, shattered word, but struggled, shaking, and thereby achieved exactitude and bearing. As for me, years later I stumbled through a cracked gate, scarcely knowing why and how I was brought to this place.  Friendship, in fact, was common property, though at first it had seemed fenced off, vietato lingresso. People watched me and shrugged. However, having finally come here to an open book, I thought it plausible to write of the intersections so that others might recognize their fate in mine as well as mine in theirs. Hence, I composed a canzone that begins, I carried my soul the other night. I carried my soul the other night. I was angry at it and concerned, and it was my own girl child who became my soul.  She was smaller and smaller, not grown up into her own real self, but small, a doll of dolls, of dolls, with the skin of a baby. Not a baby, but someone looking near to six or seven, yet the size and shape of someone whom a mother could still carry, curled and nestled, a cozy infant of about eight months, which is why I called this my soul. And I spoke to her that night and through the day. Two burettes and a scrunchie were at issue. The way it's always something simple, a pretext for feelings too large to speak of. Yet when I remembered this insight, it was way better.  past the event, thus coming far after I had needed the helpful decoding to what this then had meant and therefore felt confusion, bitterness and curiosity. Why did you not tell me you needed them to swim or to be on the team to play soccer or whatever, everything traveling backwards and behindhand? Was it too late now to buy or find those pretty clasps and bands to give my soul? Why didn't you tell me what you needed from the beginning? I wanted everything to give us satisfactions and confusion.  What could have occurred between us? Instead, there were silences, repressions, and symbolic sniping gestures. Yet when I carried you, you nestled the way they do, and milky soft against me, and you carried me. I looked precisely like you, or you looked like you, those lively eyes and dark curls and spunky disposition, and I was moved and critical. Was I any good a mother? I had thought I was a better mother, she a soul. You will have, I was told, or said, to share the guest room.  As a crowd of people is already there, and I lay her down to rest with them. There are dancers and readers and those who would not be satisfied. And with you are people you once knew and some are dead. Attend them through the many tales and songs that each might offer others or invent. The room is small, so work it out. They will wait for you as you for them with yes and no, with back and forth, the here and there, the then and now, their modes of folding and their modes of caring.  I was struck by this lightning as much as she, and I carried the soup quietly to all the beds, for all through the house it was dark, as it would have had to be, and darker the movement, stare to stare. There were many there to feed. We must all feed all the living, then the dead. And I, it seemed, had taken on one task. Don't spill it. I won't, avow. Was I alone? I did not seem to be, though this was hard to feed.  fathom when I felt the red shadow of our bloody world's insistent presence in the moon's eclipse, darkening night. And then the moon slid slowly back with full suffusing light. Yet this part of the work remains closest to darkness. The knowledge of yearning will not be complete. There is no there, it's all degrees of here. Cannot touch them whom we are marked by, but they are palpable and enter this place.  Be nomadic, nomad. Wander with the wanderers yet safe in the room. There is at once too much and much too little. Wait it out. The bit of ugly, the glitch, the torn, the sweeper, the tender, the constant reminder that things are being made, unmade and tended. You are now one part of all of this. You will be it, help it, answer and feed that surface of cries, chirps. You will call out.  Let the agony be. Comfort it. Reject the hole that someone claims is rule. A hole, a line, a hold, a lie, a hope, a hype will slide you through this most dangerous spot. Resist only rectitudes. Resist the crazed and driven knowers. Find and replace. Though the mechanism to depict this is called.

Day by day I resist morning, yet it catches, wrenches, twists, and trips me, trips me. I fall into it, no place remaining, den den bleiben is nirgens, and stand nowhere, though temporarily here, riden, riven through, tight astride, the no of yes.  inside a stranger's starker yes of no. Remarks. That gust of pulsing wide and fast, plunging crosswise, push and change that made this mark, this slash mark, this other slash mark, like any brightness blown any wing or leaf. I wanted to say it was Parnassus Nemosyne clouded Apollo for its fancier name, which wasn't true. It was just a swallowtail in which the word memory do not appear nor the touch of poetry. Just ordinary, not endangered, no more than anything. Blustered with cross drafts.  It holds tight. Creamy yellow, black lines and marks, like letters on a page, shimmered in the wind and light, and ribbon wings with bright thought dots, blue jot, red spot, rainbow, quick blue eyes. I kept losing my place in the book. It hinged, opened, and closed, as if the letters touching read the word, the word, the text. Gripping down, it snorkels sweetness precariously in transit. But losing the book with a Keats sonnet, a painful sign. When we're in rough cut, and I had to teach such statements of looming as bright star, would I were when we had it?  I hadn't begun to process loss, it blew me away. Writing is impossible, reading is sadness, a word or sentence intervoid. It all could be summarized as aftermath. This well known dream genre is well attested, yet little consolation. The recklessness of life inside itself, the double turn of throes, of throes of faith, the crosshatches of bluster, the two steep roads, the energy in wind and wing, all were intercut so fast when I hadn't time to register this time except as ripped.  What is is, what's torn is all. We're coming here with pieces of people we lost, their shadows tangled in the long vigil of the page. There was no readiness for the call. This it emerged, almost unseen, lurking, films of gray with scrims of untrackable isms shadowed under persons, apples, wall, under fold, under the scratched ink of palipsest, and under those tricky transcode systems, setting numbers to letters, then words to those sums. That pyramid of A becomes zero. Now read the newborn letter.  A stranger, a stranger universe. It will be palpable, yet balancing, who knew how, on something impalpable. This really is a documentary. All things, their elves and verge, their costs and lots and lines of provenance, the n's and y's and x and place and r's, stark in the world in which all that heartbreaking brightness will break again day by day. I say I resist morning, this mass of mixed hungers and desperate outcomes, and yet it catches, wrenches, twists and trips me, trips me. I fall into no place.  Remaining Dane Bleiben isn't you against what? Simply to be is not in being rooted but be blown away, be riding, riven, further out than loss, tight astride the no of yes, the no of yes that shadows thought, inside a stranger, starker yes of no, the yes of no that calls outright to a no matter whether a is there or not. The quotation we're coming here with pieces of people we lost was stated actually by a woman.  a woman named Norma Gabriel Taylor at the inauguration of Barack Obama and it was cited by Matt Matt Sal Dania in an article maybe. Very durable. Very, very durable. And I'm happy to have it actually. Okay. I'd like to read, it's going to be a little tight here. I'd like to read a kind of very ecstatic poem like the others weren't, right?  It goes along. It looks it's very big on the page, so it's kind of a little risky behavior. And it's on the line of two, which is redness. The line of two is always redness. There's a couple of different second poems in this. One is that it has these kinds of things every once in a while. Another is that it has some words in parentheses next to other words. And a third is it actually has rubrics, which is the title of the poem. Big things in capital letters that spell out a secret message, but not a very subtle one. Actually. But it is just another poem.  And it should, I think I'm going to try to read it very fast, but it's a very fast poem. Okay, draft ninety seven, rubrics. If the red streak of honey in the mouth, if that rush, fathoming up in fullness, if the welling of sound, the enclosed honey hold thickens, resistant to flow, yet flowing despite we are in time, whose henadark touch smears with plenitude and echo.

What word are you looking for? In a mimeographed lesson of doctor Quimby on the subconscious, I find he also calls it the book, and he said, We are not any wiser than the book we have written, where the bees came in, came to mind from their place or time into this place misplaced, when I remembered not where the book was, but their song in the sun.  On june eighth, nineteen sixty one, news came that HD had had a stroke. In July, Norman Holmes Pearson wrote, The part of the brain which controls speech has been injured, so that she cannot recall appropriate words at will, yet she does have fiercely the desire to communicate and strikes her breast in passionate frustration when there is no word at her tongue's tip. Sometimes whole sentences will come, sometimes everything but the key word. So it is I want, but one can never tell what it is she wants.  Doves. Mother of mouthings. The gray doves in your many branches code and decode what warnings we can recall of love's watery tones. She raises the bedroom window to let in the air and pearl gray light of morning, where the first world stripped of its names extends, where initial things go, beckoning dove sounds recur, taking what we know of them. And the soul leaps to the tongue's tip, as if to tell.  Secret in the word for it. The bird's claw scraping the ledges. I hear the rustling of wings. Is it evening? The wood winds chortling or piping. Sounds settling down in the dark pit where the orchestra lights glow, as the curtain rises, and in the living room, at another stage, lamps are lit. The lady in the shade of the boughs held a dove in her two hands, let it fly up from the bowl she made, as if a word had left her lips. Now that the song has flown, the tree shakes.  Rustling in the wind, with no stars of its own, for all the nets of words are gone. The lady holds nothing in her two hands, cut, the catches of the years are torn, and the wood light floods and overflows the bowl she holds, like a question. Voices of children from playgrounds come, sounding on the wind without names. We cannot tell who they are there. We were once, too, under what star, before words, after words. Hands lifted as a bowl for water, alms, or prayer, for what we heard was no more than a dove.  Hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  Oh, fateful thread. Sentences through my song most moved. Now from your courses the flame had fled, making but words of what I love. I'm going to read now with a breath. Poem I'm at work on, so it will not be in any way, this poem is intended as a sequence of like.  I've been more and I went through a period in which I reacted against the cantos because it seemed to me that pounds is always after all we had no other poems but the cantos since pound began on the cantos. Many different fascinations with the cantos. They've always been central. I began with the cantos at about the age of eighteen or nineteen and all my life have had many different ideas of them. Now recently I've been haunted by them again and they seem to me this time to open up a great freedom. That is a freedom in relation to the way in which I compose things thematically all the way through and I thought if I would open up let's say call something just passages as you might call something just fragments try to prevent it from forming into it.  poem as the Pindar poem or apprehensions formed into a total, a symphonic. The symphonic form or the sonata form fascinated me. I like to orchestrate a large poem. I like to have related movements and boxes, poems within poems, and now I wanted to see if I could let that loose. Now of course, I can't do it immediately. You'll find thematic progressions in this, but I have begun this poem in order to see if I can open up and eventually have some of these passages much more free of it. There is a kind of poem that I have never in my life been able to do and that really fascinates me.  The Williams is Spring and all. Now you see the later Williams is very much what I do do. All the later Williams is thematically composed and has a regular musical progression. But in Spring and all, there is a sequence of, I don't know, what is it, something like thirty two poems. It's much more than you could ever compose except by your intuition. So that's what I'm sort of going toward, and yet certainly at the beginning of this poem, you won't find it opening yet. I'm going to read as far as I have typed, and because this will be the first time I've read these in public.  First time, by the way, I've read that HD poem in public, and since the previous time, I was certainly not ready for it. I wasn't quite ready this time. I can't get it's one of the few poems that I can't get my distance from. And for me, the poem is a distance, not a feeling. But my feeling is so mixed up with the feeling of the poem, is the way I put it. I know the distance is there in the poem.
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81	0.0	407.03	 But but but she I think that she she's designedly in a way wanting to be there and laying claim. It's one of the places where you began to get furious because you realize something being laid on you because it's not coming from this. But so her gnomic will mean I know more than you do you little twerp and and the ruin will be I mean and and gnomic in Emily Dickinson does not mean she knows something. It means something knows that language knows something she's not gonna I mean this is the way I don't she knows she knows plenty but that's not what we encounter this so strange nor what she encounters. She'll go into speaking.  from something she knows, but to bring us clearly to the place where we are at the rune and rune is to evoke runic. Gnomic is some utterance that is very close to enigma as different from symbol enigma is something that cannot be transferred into metaphor. So while I'm talking about the metaphor here in good degree when I go through these themes that are constantly operating in metaphor, one of the things that draws her to him is that she also experiences them as enigmatic. They rearrive and refuse, as I said. So we're in the presence of a metaphor that.  can't be located that we begin to realize is metaphorical because it has no location. And meanwhile, there is an absolutely annoying necessity for a location somewhere. So place has a lot is very telling her. The sea, for instance, and over beyond there and horizon and beyond horizon are not global as they are in Whitman. Although she's got experience. I think in the early poem, she has several references to Columbus and circling the globe as such.  is there in her mind, but not when she's going over there, not when she's going to another land or another place. Well, this one little poem is not only what I wanted to speak about in the way of her striking. The gnomic and the rune both go by being very striking, and she begins to have a language which is like Spencer's. Absolutely. She has a tense that looks subjunctive. We will find that, and then she also will strike out on her own for the serpent's figure glid stealthily along.  No accident at all. We've got, I think, two versions of this. There it is. Featured terms are themselves terms standing, not symbols, standing for something that comes immediately into question, and openly into question. What does that mean? Now Rune is the one that evokes this. Rune evokes where Gnomic covers in some way or is like a husk of something that you can't get at. Rune is to call up the thing as visitation, to call up the encounter.  with the thing. And that is very frequent mode. These are the modes in Emily Dickinson. You find prayer, certainly, in the terror and all her life, she inhabited a realm in poetry that needs prayer. So we'll find prayer. And an absolute certainty that that's where she is mystic, a certainty that she's got to dwell there. But this one little poem is just an extraordinary moment, and there are several of this kind. Following that one in number ten is just.  My wheel is in the dark, I cannot see a spoke, yet know its dripping feet go round and round. My foot is on the tide, an unfrequented road, yet have all roads a clearing at the end. One has resigned the loom. Some have resigned the loom, some in the busy tomb find quaint employ. Some with new stately feet pass royal through the gate, flinging the problem back at you and I. That's again, this at you and I, this I is striking enough when you look at the titles of her poems.  And so she's the other end of, if real life, think how near she is to Debbie who didn't want the eye there. So the eye must be remembered all the time. And it must be remembered all the time at the cost of saying at you and I. Now she, back to her letter to Higginson, I didn't go to, she went to schools all right, but in the sense you mean. I mean, in the sense no matter what school she went to, the poem so invades every level that she is not making mistake when at you and I because eye is the name of a person.  This is what Miss Susan observed. So me is more likely to be the one you heard that other people that I never belonged to you. Now only by visitation does I have we got a car again parked around. Okay. Oh, sorry. And this is everybody has faces right. They don't dream that she's not. I mean, she doesn't leave you room to think, oh, she's made a slip. Or, for instance, did she do it for Ryan there? I can't take a look at where that was number ten, was it? Yes.  No, no way. No way. Absolutely. Just I. Exclamation point. In case you missed the you and I. Well, actually, she might be rhyming it with employee. But me would have been an absolute rhyme for employee. And I is a very jarring one indeed. She likes jarring rhymes, but me would have been a I mean, not me would have been very typical of her employee and me. No, it's I is a name of somebody because me is a name of somebody too for her. Now, so her shifters are real persons within the poetry.  What I would get at, and I don't mean that she thought a heavy trip around, but she must have recognized what she was doing at you and I.
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_On-Dickinson_New-College_6-30-81	0.0	517.28	 All conclusions presented seem preposterous. So what I'm thinking of is under, beneath this, there seems to be such a period of Emily's in which he emerges even freer, and the term whereas people who didn't go through that period, I'm thinking about early structures that you actually go through that you can call upon. If you don't, I mean, after all, you're going to emerge in different kind of poetry. It's all we can say. It certainly pound did not go through some such structure because he just dismisses like an eighteenth century rationalist. Well, that ends up with no atheism, no God, nothing like as if nobody's talking about anything. So he's just quarrelsome with it.  Yet, at a very later stage, he wants to take up the subject. The same happens with the economics, with Emily's feel here, her intuitions are contemporaneous with Marx's. I mean, in Marx's case, the whole topics and the whole economics are being built of it, but the underlying intuitions, the underlying feeling that it permeates all of life, which is different from any that something permeates every level of your consciousness is not reductive. And that it is, and to say that it's the real thing is, so that's I think. It is, it becomes more and more.  Amazing as you read her that she does have all her sensibility is so related to that of people working in at the same time but in other places that she couldn't possibly have read specifically. I was amazed, for example, there are lines in her work that are identical with lines in Christina Rosetti. I would check the I checked the first time Christina Rosetti's poems were published and they weren't published until nineteen sixty two when a lot of the lines that are identical I mean, eighteen sixty two. There's no possible reference in absolute identical lines. And she did have ample broadband.  She had the Bronze poetry and that's one of the books she sent to the publisher and he's overawed and sends it back to her because it was a personal issue and even then rare and much sought after. But this is the kind of thing where you do, we need to turn in scholar just to find the manuscript when we want to look at the lines to find out, well, could she possibly write for Stephen Gilbert? So there was this amazing little nucleus of women that were born almost identical time. There was Susan Gilbert when they were born five days apart or something like that or a week apart or something like that. And then Helen Hunt Jackson was born a month.  before, and there's only four days actually between her and Christina Rosetti. I mean, I was born. Exactly. And we can turn around and say that the American household at the Amherst College level and the Rosetti household Oh, they're almost that close that we haven't got a separation in the social. But we can, when we go to the Dickensons, we realize that what has disappeared in America is this English household that the Dickens have. Amherst was English through and through and through. And so it was gonna be just like England. No, no, no, it's hard to pose that you were young.  Even let's say that your family we're continually marrying English just by race, but the American family is not English through and through, nor is the English family. Another little poem that I'll just read a short quote from in the same kind of sense of counting in the material world and contrasting it with another kind of infinity is poem sixty three, which includes the lines, if springs from winter's race.  Can the anemones be reckoned up? And can as an italic, they're invaluable italics. Donato one to two. That wasn't italicized in one to two. So it wasn't developed was as it is in there. It's the two that are italicized. What was your question? Oh, I was just saying that this is a place where that.  The two kinds of infinity are brought together and put into a relationship. The infinity is diffuse, but when it's the uncountable, it means it's numbers. And numbers are not diffused at all. It means that numbers extend. Remember the other picture we have is that there's a limit, and at the limit we're at the point of diffusion. But the Pythagoreans wouldn't have they called it the C, by the way. But the C here was that there was a C of the finite, that the finite was infinite, that the particular was infinite. That's what they faced, numbers.  which were absolute but just there, went all the way out and became a sea and undid the mind, couldn't take hold of it. And Emily is amazing because she's always facing both of them. Without flinching really. I mean, she loves the numberless and is ready to look at it and ready to look at each Robin and each anemone and so on. Also immediate to it. One of the debilities of our period, let's say of Folson's head or mine, for instance, is we went to Presyncratics or I'm still amazed and yet that's okay.  That's my disposition. I've got to search out Whitehead, Heidegger, so forth, and fill my head full of them. Now, this makes my whole experience of this. Emily keeps in Emily's library, we do not find the pre Socratics right around the corner. We don't and so forth, so that many of these things are experienced as initial, they're initial in me by the way. I don't read Heidegger because it's Heidegger, I read Heidegger because I recognize. But meanwhile, I have so complicated the picture that I've almost lost the immediacy of the great thing going to that manuscript is we're in immediacies regardless of our area, but that step has to be taken back for us from Heidegger. In Emily's case, some of her.  The most rich parts of her that I'm trying to think of the guy is IK, but what is his second name? The one one of her major text draws on Marvel or something. Marvel. Now, when I got to that text, I'm going to start a book on because that those texts underlie her more surely than Emerson does. In other words, she had find found a mind that was remarkably close. But what what at the very beginning, fifteen years ago, when people started writing on my poetry and Brumage was doing his thesis, he never finally got tenure without a thesis, but he kept sending me passages every year.  Merle Ponti and I began to realize no wonder I don't want to read Merle Ponti because it sounded like he was also reading my current journals. It sounded just like my current journals. I wrote back well, but Merle Ponti and I are not that different in age and we all draw on Curler and the Gestalt in addition to whatever other psychology is around. And that's what underlies it so that no wonder we're going to but also temperament underlies it because so many people read Gestalt don't end up sounding like Merle Ponti and there were not that many passages. Olsen also comes from certain Gestalt ideas. Nowhere sounds like this. Well, there can be that.  Emily was in this kind of redundancy in which he was robbed of the immediacy in this realm of that particular Whitman who was embracing Hegel and everything is robbed of enormous areas of immediacy. So he has big nonimmediate ideas that govern the form, so do I. Emily's she's got and a lot of hers, I think one could go back to that text, the marvel that she's always going back and say, okay, these areas are almost certain to be now no wonder they're diffused. What's remarkable is she'll find the infinite where it's not diffused because marvel is not about the resurgence.

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78	0.0	403.66	 I'm going to read just one poem for my second time around. It's a long poem, which is to say a long poem for me, a longish poem. For a long time, what I wanted to do more than anything else was to get poems shorter and shorter and shorter, and then I discovered I was too successful. I stopped writing completely. And silence is great, but I wasn't happy with it. This is the newest poem I have written.  It's a poem which I wrestled with for a long time and put away untouched. And then I was asked very recently if I would contribute to a book intended primarily for children. And this sent me back to this poem again, which is a fairy tale poem. Those of you who know me at all know that one of the overwhelming interests of my life is fairy tales. And for many years I tried to turn my favorite horrific fairy tale, which is called the Juniper Tree, into verse. I was totally unsuccessful at doing this. And I've ended up doing a fairy tale from an altogether different tradition.  I'm happy that I have some Japanese friends in the audience tonight, because this poem is, in fact, a poem based on an old Japanese fairy tale, which is called Momo Taro, or The Beach Boy. I don't know whether any of you here know it, or many of you here know it, but it is a poem which always deeply moved me. Once, many years ago, I was set to learning Japanese under the auspices of the United States Navy, as a matter of fact, and the only thing I read of all the material that we went through in the process of learning Japanese that ever stayed in Japan.  My head was this story. I can still hear going in my head, for instance, the noise that the peach out of which the little boy comes makes as it turns over and over in the river. Domburi, domburi, domburi. I can hear the boy's mother talking to him as she loads him up with kibidongo, millet seed cakes, the best kibidongo in all Japan. And I can hear the animals who stop him. I've forgotten all the military Japanese I ever knew. I can't tell you the word for a battleship or a gun or an emplacement or anything else, but I can probably tell you this story in Japanese.  departed from me, and I've wanted to work it and rework it, and I've tried to find a form for it. And it finally occurred to me, with this you see, it's only one poem I'm going to read, so I have an excuse for a long introduction, right? As I thought about the appropriate form for this poem, I decided I would return to a very ancient and honorable form, very flexible and very beautiful dog rule. This is a poem which is written in dog rule. I dearly love a rhyme, I'll do anything in the world for a rhyme, and I don't much care how fast or how slow I get to it in the line.  to this story which originally had a happy ending. Peach Boy goes out and he goes to the Onigashima, the island of the devils, and he conquers the king of the demons, devils, whatever you call them, monsters, and he comes back home, makes his family happy and he lives happily ever after. But as I wrote this poem, I discovered that the ending of it insisted on changing and I couldn't finish it until I changed the ending. And this finally turned out then to be a poem not only about what I always thought it was about, which is the impossibility of finding a proper name for everything, anything. This is a poem about naming, but it also turned out to be a poem about heroism.  Heroism, an anti heroic poem. And I suppose the reason it became an anti heroic poem is because the language which I learned reading the story of the little peach boy I ended up using on the island of Iwo Jima. And too many bad connotations are connected with it. Anyhow, I think all children always know that the so called happy endings of fairy tales are lies. But they understand that we're courteous enough to lie to them and pretend that we think they believe us when we tell them that everybody lived happily ever after. You'll see nobody lives happily ever after.  This is divided into sections which are the parts of the story. The first part of Momotaro or The Peach Boy then is called The Finding of the Peach. An old wood chopper and his old wife lived in the forest for all of their life and the name of the chopper was chopper and the name of his wife was wife and the name of the days they lived was day and the name of the nights was night. But the name of the sum of them all was pain for they had borne no child to bear their name.  By the bank of the stream, Washing her wash and dreaming her dream, The old woman saw a giant peach Afloat on the water, just out of her reach. Over and over it turned in the sun, Singing a song or humming a hum Dombury, Dombury, reach out your hand What is born in the water may live on the land, What begins as a peach may end as a man, So wet your feet and catch what you can. Like a child she clutched it, clutched at the peach, Something to fondle, or something to eat, Like a child she held it tight to her breast, But knowing no name,  How should he guess what to call it, or what would come next? Peach, she called it, carrying it home to where the old man waited alone. Part two is called the Cutting of the Peach. I'll cut it, said the old man, since cutting was his trade. Let's eat what luck has brought us, why should we be afraid? But his wife was lost in wonder and talk, though not her trade, was what she did, when she was not hanging in a glade their wash, or the wash of others, or mending what was frayed. Hold off, she cried, or let me, who've held it to my breast, draw it.  the knife across its skin as soft as a caress.

Garrison-Deborah-and-Komunyakaa-Yusef_Complete-Reading_Contemporary-American-Poetry_BBC-Radio-3_7-22-99	0.0	425.99	 Amber Winder, he's lost his right arm inside the stone. In the black mirror, a woman's trying to erase names. No, she's brushing a boy's hair. I should say that it took me fourteen years to write about the Vietnam experience, and at the time I was renovating a house in New Orleans, and that pretty much prompted a moment to write about Vietnam. I had very systematically written around that experience.  Well, here's a poem that's a bit more personal. It's about something I've actually had quite a bit of trouble writing about, which was the death of my father, who passed away when I was fourteen. And as anyone knows who has lost a parent and certainly lost a parent at a bit of a younger age, there is this in a way, of course, it's an incredible tragedy, but there are other things that come with it. And I guess as I grew older, I felt a strange sense of almost specialness for having survived this thing in my teenage years. And I often have reflected on it as I've grown older that one feels the sadness and the guilt, but on another's side of the coin is the sense of having been singled out and having been made special by having to go through this experience.  And I tried to capture that, I don't know if I have, but this poem is called She Thinks of Him on her birthday. It's still winter, and still I don't know you anymore, and you don't know me. But this morning I stand in the kitchen with the illusion, peeling a clementine. Each piece snaps like the nickname for a girl, the tinny bite it was, to be one once. Again I count your daughters, and find myself in the middle, the waste of the hour glass, endlessly passed through and passed through, but holding nothing, dismayed by the grubby February sun I was born under, and the cheap pleasure it gives the window.  Yet I raise the shade for it and try not to feel it is wrong to want spring to be a season further from you. Not wrong to wish for a hard rain, a hard wind like one we sat out in together or came in from together. Here's a poem about a situation which is probably familiar to many working people and this one is particularly about working women and the way that we drag ourselves through the day, sometimes inspired, sometimes exhausted. And I think there is a particular sadness of a woman of a certain age when she begins to realize what she's been doing with her life.  Perhaps hoping for something more. Worked late on a Tuesday night. Again. Midtown is blasted out and silent, drained of the crowd and its doggy day. I trample the scraps of deli lunches some ate outdoors, as they stared dumbly or hooted at us career girls, the haggard beauties, the vivid can dos, open raincoats aflap in the March wind, as we crossed to and fro in front of the public library. Never thought you'd be one of them, did you, little lady? Little Miss Phi Beta Kappa, with your closet full of pleated skirts, twenty nine till death do us part. Don't you see?  Schoolgirl turns thirty, forty, singing the song of time management all day long, lugging the briefcase home. So at ten PM you're standing here with your hand in the air, cold but too stubborn to reach into your pocket for a glove, cursing the freezing rain as though it were your difficulty. It's pathetic, and nobody's fault but your own. Now the tears, down into the collar. Cabs, cabs, but none for hire. I haven't had dinner. I'm not half of what I meant to be. Among other things, the mother of three. Too tired tonight to seduce the father.  The next poem I'm going to read is a poem entitled The Deck, and I think the poem sort of embraces that moment when I realized something that taught me a great deal. The deck. I have almost nailed my left thumb to the two by four brace that holds the deck together. This Saturday morning in June, I've saw two by sixes tea squared and levered everything with three bubbles seal and green glass, and now the sweat on my tongue tastes like what I am.  I know I'm alone, using leverage to swing the long boards into place, but at times it seems as if there are two of us working side by side, like old lovers guessing each other's moves. This hammer is the only thing I owned of yours, and it makes me feel as if I've cottoned it for years. Even the crooked nails are going in straight, the handsail glides to grease, the toe nail studs hold, the deck has risen up around me, and now I'm strong enough to support my weight, to not sway with this old silly wrong footed dance I'm about to throw my whole body into.  From sky to ground. This morning's work can take nearly anything. With so much uproar, punishment, footwork, and euphoria, I'm almost happy this Saturday. I walked back inside and here you are, plain and simple as the sunlight on the tools outside. Daddy, if you'd come back a week ago, a day before yesterday, I would have been ready to sit down and have a long talk with you. There were things I wanted to say, so many questions I wanted to ask, but they've been answered with as much salt and truth as we can expect from the living.  I'd like to read a poem called An Idle Thought, which is the kind of daydream of a woman who's married at twenty one, which I was, and occasionally her mind wanders off to other passions she may have known. And I'd like to preface this by saying that the poem was written well before Monica Lewinsky ever appeared on the scene, so I'm now sometimes embarrassed by it because it contains a fantasy of seducing the president, which in our country, that subject has played out in a very silly way. But it also contains a British character whom listeners here may know, so I don't know if people will agree with me that this person is of some sex appeal. An Idle Thought. I'm never going to sleep with Martin Amos or anybody.  At twenty one, I scotched my chance to be one of the seductresses of the century. A vamp on the rise through the ranks of literary gods and military men, who wouldn't stop at the president. She'd take the Pentagon by storm in halter dress and rhinestone extras, letting fly the breasts that shatter crystal. Then dump him, too, and break his power broker heart. Such women are a breed apart.

That resulted in that little high woolly voice that some people have. You know, older folks are old school teacher, you're ladies, you're old school teacher, man. I don't know, you might describe me something. Oh, this would have been wonderful. Here he is. nineteen twenty eight. One period continued with the Great Law. This is from the Son of Women. What does he say? The Love was never made for man and woman to crack between them. So he loves and loves his sons and loves as he pleases. But there is a great law.  over him, which that is as it is, the wind blowing, the mud spots on the coloured surface, the face reflected in the glass, which as you advance, the features disappear, leaving only the hat. As you draw back, the features return, the tip of the nose, the projection over the eyebrows, the cheekbones, the bulge of the lips, the chin last. So he's playing tricks with his mind all the time. Yeah. Yeah, really put the tricks on the perception. And so that would give him tremendous depth. Whereas everybody else is walking around in a world already solid.  He's dissolving them with all this funny, perceptual subtleties. Yeah. And then trying to write them down. Yeah. I'll make a big, serious portrait of my time. This is twenty eight soon. Yeah. So, to continue the anecdotal aspect of this, um, see, I had a, I did an interview, did wrote the interview off. I get the, the only things I remember were, I kick your eye and the eye of a doctor. The answer to my questions is to give yourself to a doctor on the board.  The fact that he wrote any time in between patients. If he hadn't thought he might in between patients and so in a waiting room and patients coming in and out and he was always ready. Then I wrote it up and the guys from the Labor Labor Patterson Press edited it and chopped it up some very insulting. I wrote up something that was flattering I thought and they cut it and rewrote it and so I was ashamed to send it to him but it was a full page long.  I'll have to go find it again. But I still didn't quite understand what he was up to because I didn't get it. And then that same year he gave a reading at the Museum of Modern Art in nineteen forty eight. So I went to see him at the museum and he read I think he read the pure product of America to go crazy. And I understood that immediately. But the one that really got me that I guess unlocked it all was.  The clouds. The end line at the end of the let me have that. The last, the last verse of the last page of No, I don't have that here. Do you have that here? It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this. It's about this later than this later.  The last one, but he was on the stage at the Museum of Modern Archery, giving this regular reading. And it's a poem about the imagination, which I was construing as you gotta bring your imagination down to the ground and ground yourself, so to speak, otherwise we get any kind of fantasy monster, monsters of reason, monsters of imagination, irrelevancies, plunging the imagination, plunging on a butterfly, a fizzmayer, a motha. And he ended it, but he ended it with this gesture of butterfly, a fizzmayer, a motha.  Oh, I see he's just talking. His poetry is no different from somebody actually talking for real. And the reason I hadn't been able to read him is that my father's poetry and all the poetry I'd ever read was supposed to be somebody talking not for real or a different style than real conversation. Like it's a sonnet or it's a literary sound or it's a pun on somebody else's poem or it has some stale wash of another poem over it. But this was just absolute straightforward conversation.  I guess, or a declaration of speech, but the poetry was identical with intense fragments of spoken idiom, as you might hear it when I say it yourself. And that was the first time I'd ever heard of such a notion that the poetry could be real, or that reality that there could be somebody talking for real instead of making up a poem like or making up making it up to look good. And I don't know what it was that I could I don't know how if I could even now describe what my idea of poetry was before, except it was supposed I didn't, I just never thought of it.  But it had never occurred to me that it could be identical with actual speech. And once I understood that, then I could start reading him. And I began reading him, and that really blew my mind. Then after that, I think it was he read the pure products that America would go crazy, and that was very moving. Because I finally understood his fifty, I thought about the Arsenal of the Sun of Sky, and we created freezing, which was questionable. And then the interesting thing was when he had to make an imagination of heaven or what he desired, it was a real downturn.  Earth is very common while the imagination is golden rod. Deer going strange after deer going by and feels of stuff. Golden rod and stuff. Somehow it seems to destroy. No one to witness the justice. No one to drive a car. So once I once I got the idea that he was talking for real and then he said something as straightforward as that we gotta eat shit and we wouldn't want that the way we wouldn't.  We are living, it's like we're eating shit instead of desire. That seems really radical to me and amazing that anybody would be seeing anything so interior and frank and realistic, just like you think to yourself when you're alone in bed at night. And somehow that change turned me around completely as far as what poetry was. Just before that I've been writing rhyme first.  Community to Thomas Wyatt. I see that sense of your obviousness that it's not simply a depressed state of mind, but it's a sense that the resources or the determinations of the common world have really been disappointing to put it mildly in the sense that their use has been nothing one had hoped to use to either act to effect and or hope might otherwise might prove the case.  We've just been talking a group of not that comparatively younger, but of undergraduate class rehearsing the political events of the last of yesterday, particularly, and then disposition. For example, Allen had a piece from the Boston Globe which has been doing an intensive investigatory business on the sources of information of the FBI. The FBI had obviously had pulled back from using its own people and covered illegal information.  And apparently it's got a whole sort of almost one wants to say a subculture of eager beavers or voluntary people. Vigilante? Yeah, vigilante groups that are effectively doing the same investigations for all the legal but not constituting federal developments and determinations. Anyhow, we're talking about this and talking about the Sandinistas and could one think of it as simply good guys versus bad guys? Alan had seen the graffiti in the bathroom just a few moments ago that said if you like Cuba, you really love Nicaragua.  I'm saying that, you know, would that the Nicaraguan government would have simply sweetness in life. But in fact, it is a very, you know, it's a very one party government, very determined attitudes, and very real senses of social conduct being either for the camp or against it, so that. Yeah, really, really very determining of social conduct, as I was saying. Then we think of other things of the Israeli palace, the Palestinian business. But I was thinking it's bleak indeed these days. It was obviously bleak in Williams' time, equally to think of what you could propose as a viable.  It's a consequent world for these maginations, and or the practical lives of the young, it's only worth that. I felt that at one time, apologized for these two visits, that the world was not a better place. Yeah, felt that he and his peers had really fucked things up, you didn't use that expression, but that was mid fifties. That was mid fifties. That was mid fifties. Well, he'd been sympathetic to communism a little, I bet. Yeah, well, I think the reason of Russia, you know, you're going to be married, you're married, you're going to paint churches. Yeah, which is good.  He doesn't say pink without, without a relationship. Payoff is, again, this is the time when he writes that poem, so I think it's, I remember it being published in the late forties, or forties in any case, early fifties. There was a chat book that Richard Worth Emerson published called Pink Church. And this was a time when the whole definition of fellow travellers of the pink holes was very active in the public book, Canada, so you hardly write a poem called the pink church. Especially when you said, come on, you communists, so and so members, you know, drunks, surreal.  Is there something there? It said the ends with Milton singing among the rest, like a communist. Yeah, Milton the Enlightener singing among the rest, like a communist. And it's an incredible terrific poem. The pink church is literally a woman's grave, but it's, yeah, he certainly had. Then his good friend Fred Miller was specifically, specifically Marxist. There's always some person in relation to Williams, as Mike Uber years ago pointed out, who's crucial to him as a scientist.  Not as a gopher, but as someone who almost works through to get a ground, much as McDonald's. This angle of McDonald's is actually taken away from him by HDM Bryan. I have to see if there are a couple other little things I remember from other visits. Yeah, here. One was what was his fight with TSLEO? Yeah. He went to a local poetry society like the Ramapho County Poetry Society and their invitation.  at somebody's private house, so he took me along, so we had a meet or a date, and he said we'd be like, okay, so it was just a little, a little small poetry circle from local Jersey, which you'll see. And I asked him, first I asked, was asking him, for a long poem, what kind of rhythm, what kind of rhythm or what kind of first line, what kind of measure for a long poem. He said, all different kinds. It was sort of like in Flanders and more like what he did in Patterson, and what he was doing then in Patterson.  Olson did, which was some rhymes, some prose, some triadic lines, some short, short lines, ballads. But he was saying for a long time in the twentieth century, a great number of different verse forms broken up, you know, like a broken collage rather than a monotonous single verse line. Then I see, what is it, why don't you like this Elliot? What is it? Because he had said, he'd written it, and I said that again to me, that Elliot was such a genius that he'd said multiple American poetry.  twenty years. What do you mean by that? And he said, Not bastards. No, that son of a bitch. He was really angry at him. The only time I saw him in Temporary, that son of a bitch, I met him. And we met a few years ago or something on some occasion, and Elliot came over to him, or they were introduced to me. Oh, doctor Williams, I do so admire your characters. Let's have more of them. Oh, gosh. Characters. Characters, meaning you like the character of the Happy Warrior. Little descriptions of people like the portrait of a lady, you know, the Elliot.  I don't know, portrait of them or Madame Sosasteros or whatever. So I do so admire your character. Let's have more of it. And William said he was so condescending without knowing it and presumptuous and deliberately using all that English stylistics on me when he knew what my interests were that that that he wanted to put my little my poems into the category of Johnsonian character Johnsonian.
Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09	0.0	356.79	 That joy lasts as long as your walk through the city and dissolves when you return home to your work to how far there is left to go with it. In the fall of nineteen ninety seven I moved into a two bedroom flat just up the street from my previous residence, though here everything was different. Now I had one roommate instead of three, which meant I could occupy the living space less anonymously. The reason I at times experienced certainty that I started this book in the summer of nineteen ninety eight is that through the window of this new bedroom I saw my friends.  I was struck by what I thought was an anomaly until I began seeing this type of tree all over that unique city. Within the first few sentences of the novella after that you will find the concrete tree outside my window written quite simply. Years later I would have to rewrite that passage as too many people unfamiliar with the concept concrete tree worried of its incongruous presence. A few months ago I addressed this concern by changing the text to the trees outside my window are the first in a series of architectural leaps intended to beautify this city, these saplings protected by the city.  cylindrical holes of concrete. To those of you who also lived in this great cement city, I apologize for such an overt description, but there are certain things one cannot understand if one has never seen them. For instance, it never snowed in my previous city, the city of the novella, yet today it is late March in my new city, and flurries blow past the window. I have called Cheby to tell her this, and she sputters what what? wrapping her mind around the concept. This is what you do when you are editing, isn't it? You move texts around, you delete something that does not have the anticipated effect on your city.  You write down somewhere that you have deleted that thing, then you put a question mark beside it. How many times have I been thrown into confusion when explaining to someone the cuts I've made, that person being different from the trial reader, and that person has responded with a violent shake of the head, pressing the point, I totally understand that, put it back in. The number of times I have done that matches the number of times I have run to a nearby park, thrown myself on a bench, and fallen over with my head in my lap, my hands scraping the ground with the smallest of smiles on my face. Confusion is a gift, I have always thought.  Similarly, when I am in the midst of an overwhelming sadness, those moods that have no identifiable cause, I begin to marvel over the ability to have such feelings. I write something down, usually on a loose sheet of paper, thinking the feelings too fleeting for my diary, and give that smile again, buried in the typical frown of sadness, because what I have written is beyond me. Eventually one comes to know what belongs in a book one is writing and what does not, and eventually one changes one's mind on all of this. I finish the final version of the novella after that.  Late summer two thousand three, after two extensive rewritings and probably two less intense reworking and countless line and paragraph edits, plus two shelving and one almost utter shredding, and then I ran outside. The relief, I felt, was tremendous, though ultimately short lived. You have finished your novella, I told myself. You have made a place for it. I was in my new city when I said this. I had changed cities because I could not stand to see the demise of my old one, though I was aware that I had been living in its entrails for some time. But I do not think I need to reiterate my reasons for blindness.  myself to that reality. As it goes, I moved, many places at first, then finally settled on this new one. Why am I here? I asked myself, walking among its thousands of ghosts. I could not find an answer, but in the interim I met a girl and became enamored with her, she will be referred to as M. I showed the novella to M once she had read my other work, and upon finishing it, she said, Hmm, studying me. We were in a very large park. I think she turned her head to see if this park mirrored the one referred to in the novel. I didn't write it here, I explained it to her.  To believe me, well, people will think what they want, it is their right, I suppose, but after that could never have been written in this city. I wrote it in a place of perpetual sun, a place that never rose above thirty degrees Celsius, I've given up Fahrenheit in protest of the government, and never sank below ten, a place of crowds that did not overwhelm one as they do here, a place whose incomparable ease explains the near flatness of the writing, this flatness which I could never alter and always haunted me. That first summer in my new city, the sensation of my own flatness was very strong. With Em in the park.  I was struck by the persistence of it. This feeling, which I thought I had rid myself of by simply maturing as a person, had never left me. It had just taken on another form, manifesting itself differently, yet deeper with every subsequent book. It strikes often at the end of the day when I am reviewing some work I have just written, and I find myself thinking that it is not writing that I have done, it is speech or error, plain error, it is zero, it is a gesture, a sign, an indication of writing, but not writing, not at all writing.
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76	0.0	350.16	 Nowadays I'm more or less content to let a lot of things take their own courses, like amiable rivers, making blue lines down the map of history. I'm not saying that some things don't infuriate me, they certainly do, but I've learned mostly through stupid repetition, the same patience I apply to my own works, moving them out of range of good and evil, is applicable, in a romantic way, I guess, to things natural and unnatural. Outside myself, I'm on better terms, though still able to bear grudges, with most things and people, more socially amiable, no longer stand in a corner at parties, facing into the wall, smelling the school like plaster getting plastered. Now I talk it up, and even when down, never talk.  I've learned to like winters more, but hate the end of same, feel relief at spring, crave sun on body, enter through the lobby of annual depression, have greater sense of personal comfort, expanding horizons, ability to survive, and know how far I'll go to do, in this year of famine and pestilence, have learned to keep my mind and ear cocked like a gun for the true poetry of the language to go off, and fill the sky of the mind with angels conversing, and have enough memory left to remember and write the angels down, without pinning a single body or wing. I have finally returned to the cheerfulness I had when very young, before the bubbles in my personal life.  Consultor had gone flat, when the fingers of school, having opened my thinking cap, kept the bottle open long enough to let the fun out, amidst a multitude of others asking one way or another, Whatever happened to you? You were such a cheerful kid. And there I am. Wiff. An evening spent talking, spent thinking about what my life would be if I'd stayed with a particular girl or woman I went with, what would be, if I'd have been accepted to and gone where I applied to a different school than the one I did, where I'd learned different social graces than the ones I have, where some of the material values of the American dream had rubbed off enough to make me live it.  If I'd settled down and settled for the foundation on a house for future generations instead of assuming immediately past generations my foundation to mine, if I'd have been a little quicker to learn what was expected of me and wanting to please, pleased, going on that way through all eternity, I've probably been saved from mere routines by a streak of stubbornness, by a slow mind and tendency to drift, by an emotional development that requires my personal understanding before happening, feeling out the implications an emotion has in form of expectation before trying out an after awareness. I sense a willingness to tell someone I know and like and sense the same thing.  from anything they'd like to know about me, and at the same time have a vast sense of privacy, which means there's no way I'll wear out my personality and its sense of continuity, although sometimes I feel empty. But talking to someone I like and trust and sense the same from, I feel way up, and after a long evening of talk about this and that, feel wide awake and feel the world wide and awake around me, and have a visual intensity in memory that in near memory dulls and throbs and grows vivid as hell. When I bring it to mind some time from then, what my life would have been like under different circumstances would have been different, with its own attendant ifs and its own what might have been.  to follow and cast my vote each waking day in, I avoid the possibility of taking the past too seriously, or feeling any bitterness or sadness. This way, when my ship comes in, I'll have passed out of mind beyond the sight of land, and won't hesitate for a second to look back on all this with fondness or remiss. The air'll be clear, the moon'll be there, and you, whoever you are and hope to be, will be here with my love. Ninth Street. Old people, old people, large clouds high, with expanses of high blue, palm front huts, white buildings, blue trim, sea green.  Everybody walks slow the same. The women have the same white sweater. The men have the same white shirt, bellies, very green grass and palms. Everyone has a hunch. They're moving their life into the road of the shoulder of life. Water cool enough to refresh, thigh deep out far from the lighter green to the darker green. Head for the green blue. More women than men. No smiles. Visions of the endless end of life. Visions of holocaust. How easy it is to have. Visions whited buildings, growing whiter and pulsing in the blue in the white pulse of the sun. Visions of the beginning and end of work. Visions of palms waving goodbye and the sky reading the upward waving palms. Light gray pebbled streets.  Highways and big hotels, big and little white curves, yellow light the same yellow as light through window shades, only no shades, blinds, jealousies, cool breezes blowing through the moisture from the sea, very little talking, only talk, fervent deals and wheels, emphatic gestures into tubby waistbands, temple chants grazing my temple through speakers as some misters and a missus pass the microphone, visions of vegetable stands, movies changing three times a week, lavender blue hair, blue gray hair, gray green water with a middle layer of hazel green, staring up at bridges, cars, trucks, buses, fishermen looking down straight in the deep and reeling the lure in, visions of curves and angles going every which way.  way, keeping me awake longer than usual each night, till sleep takes me over, over the water with deep blue lights, through memory of the land with puffs of light green snow, laid out neatly as far as the eye can see, over the shoulder, visions arriving over the shoulder like gulls, visions sitting and waiting for the beach to empty, and the sun to enter the lost and found. And this is the last poem. We are in a strange country. We are sitting in a room full of strangers having a meal.

But it all gets even creepier still, pumping my disturbance with phonation, days go by, open vowels, not generating much future sound, losses, where all this will have happened, any commonplace strung out on death.  being still produced, disfigure gently now my ratcheted dejecta, his leg becomes my fluted stump, my lip his anal spur, missing tongues insert the word whose shock force grives resistant, salvage, ours, being squandered in advance, we molt in network fibre, having traced the place of future action what can't be named in a field of roots, so come inside my fjord of mannered lights, now watch the eyes peel back, so pasted to the blazing.  Tailbones poking through our faulty huts. Even if you don't like housework, you may still, he says, court tendencies to overdo things sometimes like sucking cock in corporate coffee booths, bunkers, unprotected city parks, remains no civic foundation. Yeah, I like that. Recombining activities to beat the system with money saving coupons we could organize and shop for two or more if we could only share some of this.  He seems sincere and I wasn't thinking anymore about the war or the local hunters who'd love to take us bone fishing any time can really help you unwind.  So the only thing I'll mention before I get underway reading this narrative section called Reconciliation Under Duress is that the word galaxy appears midway through and I'm referring to the car. Where once a history, now these collective fantasies of feeling obtain. Maybe that's all it ever really was, he says, a residual film of imputed consciousness linking skinny necks of land.  Personal reflection, this mutilating gruel. Craven still with his limb in my mouth, siphoning trace nourishment from what particles remain to be negated, this endless operation. Digging deeper still for concrete elements, our loss has been preoccupied. Look how I'm becoming catacomb and worm, he says triumphantly. These recurrent conceits, achievements conditioned by the apparatus itself. Secreting a second film or residue, then becoming nature. That's us inside some.  Currugated flag, waving pictures of the building stones, one hundred little heaps, the girter scrap, as if there were nothing nothing true still lurking here, bits of cellophane, the macadam and tin, what clings to our skin as we cling to this, it's as if each temporal element were replete with its own affirmative moment. Imagining the rumored place, sensing devastation from the fringes of a lake. The time of this conditioning and the terror in this.  So where's this rumored place? he asks. And I'm pointing out beyond the docks, out to rock on the horizon, as if the thing out there were already in here with us, screaming something I'm not doing there, oh there, beneath which all our tenses buckle and our phrases all give way. Unable to document anything but my own mute evacuation, and failing even that, the emergent crowd, in which our aims remain embedded. Grace radiates from my particle.  And I extend this to you for use. Something's reaching back to us from where the event will have taken place, now a bit further, still unable to document anything that's happening, alluding to uneven strata in production, whereby these fissures and coherence through which untimely events to come. But unlike this sense of weakness, our radical need for these endless negations, the fashionable propensity to not to is a formula in the logic of our own inaction, now expressed faithfully.  by the apparatus itself. I is my own little fuck, a little parlor prance, an organ strained through too much concentration.
Halsey-Alan_Complete-Reading_BUS-MFA_Boise_10-15-10	0.0	395.85	 There is no arguing with vain terror and negligence. I am very unwilling and not obliged to write my history of melancholy, but to let madam do what unhappy fancy that confinement and fetters, too ugly to kiss Doctor Shanson, would not trouble too much with the lives of the poets, in unmerciful nights and great want of company, sadly broken, but one of the most fervent and eloquent prayers.  I think Johnson's History of Melancholy has got to be one of the unwritten books we most regret, because I'm not sure what it would tell us, but it's bound to be interesting. And the only person who'd come anywhere near him in promise of books which he'd ever wrote is Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In a way, writing these little poems is what I have to do all the time is to look for the specific density of a poet's language. And once you've found that, the rest of the poem is there.  And with some poets, even quite difficult poets, you can find that specific density quite quickly. With Coleridge, you've got to swim through an ocean of words before you even get any sense of it. And so, in many ways, the Coleridge life is by far the most complex of these. Half awake and half asleep dreamer of ugly things and little tales, in a rage for a sunny corner and Bowles' sonnets, my illegible unchastities.  of tenacious memory in Henley Pesthouse, with a perfectable scheme of Cottage Dell and Brother Southey, and to marry the woman I, Watchman, love best of all created beings. These poems and a flaming prospectus. A father transpierced, Brother Poole, I have read almost everything, while Wordsworth and his sister and myself afloat in a sort of reverie. To feel what I now feel, Laudanum alone gave me repose.  This silence and hipt my poor muse and keynote pain, scribbler ghost until nature in her long entrancement, a bulgy black drop precipice blended, ebon her name ebon, and if on my cheek I conjure lazy bed shadows into Azra, echo upon echo twelve drops an eighth part of what I took at Keswick, dreams as my life I dread to write and sleep, my pocket books the history of every error, most shocking pandemonium of grief.  Shame. Lancinations of jealousy. W. The Bed SH. Cancel. El Pizermine. Mammia pulcherima aperta. Cancel. I, that dire poison and delusive thoughts cruelly crowd for a time. Darling passion, or tyrannic, that spider webbed steel in which my soul flutters, contemptuous silence, and W's no hope of me whirled about, a chasm, claw like consciousness, a shadow which tells us what we are not, an immedicable nothing, but contradiction around it against new terrors, that full uncurtainment.  of the imagination, pioneer to my work on the Logos, again and again through the magic glass and meditative excess, unity in many, unmeaning, blank in a wilderness of sleep, poor Heartley whirling, drowned soul fleeing, feeling all the talk, half dream, half phantom to actual. Geraldine was talking about living in Sheffield, which isn't really notable for its poetic tradition.  And I think the best known poet who ever lived there was a man called Ebenezer Eliot. He was known as a corn law rhymer. Because most of his work, in fact, his poems dedicated to the abolition of the corn laws, which were a particularly iniquitous tax of the early nineteenth century. Basically a tax on bread. It was a way of ensuring that poor people starved. And it took thirty years of effort by people like Eliot to get it revoked.  Devil's dull son, then doubtful whether man or maltworm, flitting to Sheffield with eight or nine children in a cart. His feelings hammered cold short will snap and fly off. Our corn law rhymer, whose pamphlet, printed by order of the Sheffield mechanics against wilful men, who taxed our cake, and took our cake away. His mouth, his alphabet, whose grindstone and garden, ranter, scavenger, preacher.  Is this famine life of England so lovable, the souls should return? I think we know the answer to that. I'm a lighter, no. I have a great liking for the parson poets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They're quite wonderful. I think they kept poetry alive for about one hundred fifty years. Sort of sat in their rectories writing poetry which nobody's ever read. He's one of my favourites, Charles Turner, who in fact was.

They both were fighters, my mother and father. I remember him pulling the tablecloth off the table when his breakfast didn't suit him. What a mess. And the time she threw a meat cleaver after him and it stuck in the door jamb inches from his head. He stopped and she says he turned pale but he left. Time and again he left and when he came back it's called coming back home after a few months or whatever time they'd get along until they didn't.  All over Texas, never more than six months in a place, usually it was closer to three or four, and they fought wherever they were together. So I never made any friends that lasted, and everything was various depending on whether it was just my mother and me, or whether my father was there, and whether they were trying to run a restaurant together, or whether my mother was working as a waitress. Do you know that breakfast shift, dinner shift, swing shift vocabulary? There was once when she worked in a candy factory coating chocolates and putting the identifying little swirl on top. What I remember most often is that we were just the two of us living in a bedroom in somewhere.  And my mother's salary would run ten dollars a week, and the room plus board for me and the landladies looking after me would run seven. I don't mean to make this sound pathetic. At some time during that, when I was five, I started school, and I was a whiz. I went through the first and second grade the first year, and I went through the third and fourth grade the second year. And the third year when I was seven, I was in the fifth grade and broke my arm twice, so I got slowed down.  My father was with us then and we were living in a three room house with a yard and honeysuckle on the porch at the bottom of a hill that's notable for a line of twenty foot high block letters filled with regular light bulbs that in the night glared out welcome toward the highway. I loved that sign. It felt like being in church to stand at the base of those letters. Just to finish that part of the story, the next year we went to New Mexico and I went from being a whiz to passing the sixth grade conditionally. I was a kind of house dummy thereafter. I don't remember whether I had any notion.  of what went wrong. It feels like years of chaos. My father finally truly left around then. We sat in my Aunt Thelma's house south of Albuquerque and he roamed in the night around the house yelling, Nora. And my uncle Everett would yell back, Nora doesn't want you anymore. And I've got a twenty two here. And my father finally left for good. But while I feel like that has to be told somehow, these few pages going the way they've gone, what I really want to mention and it took me until yesterday to get it into the air is that all that time and right from the first reading.  was my darling pleasure. There was a running set of lies that got handed to me all the time I was growing up. Whenever issue number one came up.  All the women's faces changed and all the girls were lied to. I realized it was a conservative and protective device, but at my end of it, it added up to a lot of confusion. For instance, my fourteenth birthday was marked by my first visit to a dentist. Dentists are on hard times in West Texas, where the water has natural fluoride. My mother's nearing sixty and has had three fillings all her life long, and she got those because she moved away from Texas. Anyway, at the time I'm talking about, we were living in York, Pennsylvania, to be near my stepfather before he went off to war, and it was my fourteenth birthday.  The boy, a boy who was maybe sixteen, was going to come to the apartment later and formally ask my parents if he could take me on my first official date. They had agreed that he could ask, so it seemed likely the answer was yes. While I was at the dentist's, my mother started to show Dutch the presents I had got from my friends, three or four small things, one of which was the classic five year diary, which fell open when she laid it down. But what I had immediately written in on receiving it so as not to forget, the entry was the week before in the movie house with my friends, I had kissed Dutch.  boy who was due to arrive around four this afternoon. It was there in black and white with ecstatic exclamation marks. That entry proved to be the first and last of that possibility. one thousand eight hundred twenty four days down the drain, precluded by stupidity. I had taken the abstraction of my diary as an allowance, proof against getting hoisted on the hook because you wrote it down, the power of a defined occasion. And I learned the way it really was when I got back from the dentist and faced those two faces, me the birthday girl and then the tribunal.  There was no doubt that I had made a mistake. My mother took me into the kitchen to talk to me. Kissing in the movies is vulgar, but worse than that, and she rang the shift on me. No girl should kiss a boy until they're engaged. I couldn't believe it that she was saying it. I looked at her, and she looked as solemnly back as if she meant to stand by that statement against come what may. I just lost my place. I couldn't believe it. I mean, she came off a fall.  And when Aunt Myrtle's baby came, seven months after she was married,
Howe-Susan_04_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_11-6-94	0.0	355.04	 Cries of love and alarm on the soundtrack fade into an air raid siren, factory whistle, or is it the whistle of a train approaching? We are as real and near as cinema. A little girl half turned away, holding her doll, smiles shyly. When the ambiguous siren or engine wails its warning, she turns directly towards the camera. Medium close up, her expression changing to a mixture of astonishment or terror. This child isn't acting. Perhaps she knows what the young actor in Ivan's childhood pretends he knows. Her look pierces the mask of Western.  Almost forty years later, in june nineteen seventy two, a terrified Fan Thi Kin napalmed in era by a South Vietnamese bomber will come running naked down a road, having torn off her burning clothing. She is running towards the camera's single eye. A man without wings swings slantingly into view through free space, mute sky. One, two, three, four, five, six seconds of silent soundtrack before liturgical music through fading to a certain point, then tapering.  Getting wave notes risen from years of other powers. Balancing and hovering, he is swinging in a basket, as if reentrance is easy. Swings in again, coming home, so it's a picture projected through time, subtler than poems or a letter, because he is working on it. Found footage shown at slower speed, here is power. A tremendous stratosphere spinnaker, so weightless after the weighty Spanish evacuation sequence, hovers, preparing for liftoff well he needs no map to return, if fiction, angel, astronaut, returns.  to home base, as if he merely floated out of sight for fun, as if reentrance is possible, and surely there are to be anchorage mooring, helpers waiting. Starboat USSR resembles a light sail of great speed, used on yachts when running before the wind, spinnaker, because a yacht called Sphinx carried such a sail in eighteen sixty six. Utilitarian loveliness, a huge bubble of nylon pulling tons of boat through water, but sometimes relentless swinging and thrashing shakes the rig out of her tug in.  Drawing now the long chase ahead. Coming next will be other newsreel footage of young soldiers slogging through mud and shallow water, not doing well exhausted, though one or two smile wanly at the camera. I wish you could see this film. Sometimes I recognize you inside it, so scared and young, always among those Soviet soldiers who were crossing Lake Sivash. Why should there be twice as many sick as wounded? You float back to me everything inexpressible. Aerodynamic repair experiment for the freshly washed white stone.  USSR, getting ashore to let you sleep well. Light sail of great spread used on yachts when running before the wind. Once you could cover my hand completely with your palm. A huge bubble of nylon pulling tons of water through sky water, swinging and thrashing, relentless threatening to shake the rig out, now tugging water, now touched by science, now drawing silence inside the long chase ahead. Scenes like this, men use. Clinging vine method to hang on, filling out, running before the wind.  But here there is no yacht, and open ocean is air. The effect is the same, flying jibout astride the small boom so spinnaker to get north. Smaller balloons circle and touch the mother one, as satellites do. Then sacred chorus, singing sanctus, sanctus, all is well, melody for a while. Melodies antedate languages, they do not grow old. A peaceful, weightless, wingless furlough, one or two other balloons revolve around these smaller powers after peace. One aerialist soldier, attached by a string to a satellite balloon, floats.  Floats in and down across the screen from right to left, where are his supports as child attached to a mother? As if he were returning home again, a crowd to watch and applaud, so from heaven he smiles. Where are you, systems of planets around us, drifting out of sight, away out of the frame of the screen behind the wings? Annihilation is the deep chaos answer, sheets and white film turmoil. It's a separation wish to be carried out also as if to silence of ether. Irrationality of speech to surrender the beauty of ether.  This voyage without baggage to shed earth because our fathers have not kept their word. Artivisers and builders convey to one another someone was thought to be worthy. Colorless prefigures a connection when the unconscious mind mirrors love partners who are in absolute contrast but by early influence that the child had had time, if ever there was a way, to translate the feeling of image juxtaposition in these words moving from left to right across this sheet of paper.

It's just So, you should say, just look, see what you've got. That's a reverse. It's not a reverse. I know, but see, I'm so messed up. No. No. I believe that that's our first one. No. No. It should say fit her feet of her.  Oh, damn. This is what we have in this, this was the, this was in the broken projector in that order. What have we done? We've done something more than that. All right, well anyway, let's try, I give up. I mean, darn, get what No, see, two are missing. Two are missing. It must, they must have gone down. Okay. Go back. All right, we just got to skip that beautiful palm. I'm sorry.  It's gone. No. Oh, wait a second. That could be the expression. There it is. This is recently being spelled by Amherst. Oh, that's so expressive. Believe me, this is it. Just an unknown thing. Okay, now can you get the one on the other side there? Yes, yes. There. Okay, somehow this is obviously fading fast. So this is a poem continues. It's unusually long for her. Okay, so you open this.  Now, you open the sheet and this is what the situation is on a sheet of, you know, two sides. Okay, but the poem doesn't end till that line. All right. This line at the bottom, here's one of these two line things that to me are very important. Again, I mean, I don't know if she ran out of paper or could she have said, why did she not say, well, I ran out. She does line things up very carefully, but why does she not start? He must pass the crystal angle over on that page and let this.  What decision, where that decision comes, but whatever has happened, you are left with he must pass the crystal angle that obscure her face, which to me is a completely fantastic line of two lines and break. And it's a he now remember her sweet home, her sweet turn to leave the homestead. He must pass the crystal angle that obscure her face. And then up there, he must have achieved in person equal paradise. And then all those variants.  And then that's the end of that poem. But he must pass that the crystal angle is just I can't get to the bottom of that line. It is revelations, obviously, some reference to revelations, but I think that it's very important that there's a cross over the word angle. Now you can go back and figure out in Johnson and show you what should go there, but I don't to me that's not important.  Let me just think now, first, distance be her, oh, distance be her only motion. Is it beautiful? That's another. Now, you see there with these crosses, I don't know, distance be her only motion. Don't you feel that there's some, I don't know, there's some like an accent or something. That's what those crosses are. Yes, that's what I'm thinking. Consistency there. No, I don't think they are. See, I don't think I mean, I think if you're looking for any kind of answer or consistency, you'll never find.  She's again, that's what she's completely against. And that demural, all the things that demure. I mean, a demure woman, but a demure is both refusal and, you know, okay, I will do this. It's two different things. The whosoever, she repeatedly used whoso and whosoever in this classical. And then there's this short poem after it. He has an element of blank. One of my students wrote a really interesting paper on.  on Dickinson's use of blanks, of just blanks in Dickinson. And blanks has been charged things. And I mean, I think that this way of printing the poems and looking at the poems really very much shows, I mean, that's true. And that's really, then I love that new periods of pain. And then day, the word day, because you know, when you're terribly depressed, you wake up and it's another day. It's just another, you know, it seems I think that it's beautiful the way that day is just fitted in at the bottom.  And then the line kind of spreads along after it rather than really under it. The three little crosses at the top were made by someone else, you know, as a marking. Another student, I had this minister who was in my class at Temple this year, and he made this wonderful statement, work of Emily Dickinson is covered with crosses. And I thought that was just gorgeous. And it is. I mean, not only are this covered with these crosses, but it's covered with crossings and crosses that you don't know where you are or what you where you should be.  Anybody want to say anything about any Yeah. They're really, I mean, they're very different and they're not just plain dashes and sometimes commas look like dashes and sometimes the top of T's like up here. This is like these are sort of like seen to continue those. You see what I mean? And then they, when you start really, I don't know how you would add it differently because when you start worrying.  See, how much space she leaves between phones becomes a big to me, it becomes a big issue. And then I wonder, am I just, is this silly? I mean, is it an issue or isn't it an issue? And then, but the worst issue is the dashes. And I just, I think that you are really the way to do it. The ideal way to do Eddie Dickinson would be to put a palm on one side and then a printed transcription on the other side. But I think you would run, you know, you would try to match those dashes in the directional pull the way she does.  I couldn't really anyways, you'd miss something. You could never, you see, you couldn't cross teams like that. And this little mark here, you couldn't think. Well, here's, this is the net, we're sort of like, so much summer is on the, that would be, that would be on the end of this series that I've just been talking about. Have the truth, but they both jammed in. Okay, no, you just don't, I wouldn't dare try anything else. But look at this poem here.  I'm sorry it's so dim now, but look at the cross T's on this one. So much summer, me for showing illegitimate. Illegitimate alone on the line there. With a smile's minute bestowing too exorbitant to the lady with the guinea. This is one of these poems.
Jarnot-Lisa-and-Laynie-Browne_Complete-Reading_KWH-UPenn_4-22-14	0.0	482.22	 Feels like home to me. I'm really grateful to be here and to be reading with my friend Lisa. Can everybody hear me all right? Okay. I'm going to read in two parts. I'm going to read first from the new book Lars Parkour Psalms, and then I'm going to read some new Amulet Sonnets. So this book, Lars Parkour Psalms, is just out in France, and it's a dual edition in French and English, the separate books, but out at the same time. And in the title, Psalms within Psalms, Alms is in parentheses.  And about parcours, I just wanted to say that it's an activity or practice of moving rapidly, usually through an urban setting, as would a stunt person be moving. And so this seemed to me as an apt metaphor for thinking about the risks involved in contemplative practice, and just considering the psalm as a poetic form. So beginning with an epigram from Joanne Kaiger, the place we are going is the place we are going.  Place we were before we were born. Psalm undone. Rushing to contain and not complain, what is sung, do this without assault, therefore exist everywhere. I will make a character and one of my characters, not a letter nor a frown, will be undone by a new landscape.  Missive Psalm. How to be truthful to one's woods or were they? Never have seen such a text, sudden eruption, scribes of erudite biddings ask, To whom shall I send my? Vanishing Psalm. I can vanish every minute of every day, but to where shall I go?  Your pleasure is in choosing the vanishing point. If you are accomplished at leaving the world in this manner, at what are you accomplished? Apothecary Psalm. I am so open to you, who do not exist, except in dream. And you always reply, just as I like, from your book of dream. Uninscribed Psalm.  The hours I have forgotten to inscribe are written in silence. Where speech would rather summon air overrun with visitations, the hours belong to no one. We stand or recline to incite them. Obligatory murmuring or rushing words are as nonsensical as refusing to greet your beloved. There is another way.  form which does not appear or cling to the house you cradle. And what is the third way within which appears no argument, meaning all imperatives become transparent, illustrating the argument as a skeleton which impels movement so you don't complain of it or even remember this inner matter as you lift a cup to your lips? Insistence, Psalm. What are you leaving? A body for thoughts of a body?  Incessantly going is a type of insistence and invisible leaning. You walk this way because your legs carry you. You allow yourself to expire because each morning you awaken. Psalm for expectancy. Success is also a sudden barricade from accomplishment. In cities, as elsewhere, we live only so long. I am just a visitor here, speaks the Rebbe.  as to his modest abode, a cot in a single room amid piles of books. This is just a text meaning nothing is recoverable except your recovery. This one I'm dedicating to Lisa. Psalm for conspirators. Conspirators awaken on their pages in cabinets and fences in states of such I have never seen or states I have loved as dearly as delirium.  They key or call variously, where I am taught, they flag, without such pulleys, levers, trance, and delicate nets, I'm lost. Psalm in a foreign language. Jade's is J, my souvenir well, vying festoon, or sacrament tour of the heart, a tout with vines consulting beauty of mesh genomics, armor, or trove as injury, O sorcerers.  O miser, O heroine, this voyage of moon treasons accomfit your taut joint and tankers of fate. Song for monumental. In an airless, airless, airless room, why are we using their definition of success? What is monument, monumental?  Beneath the place of sorrow is another place, so minuscule found, grown larger by minuet. To be presentable is something beneath the scene, seen and seen. How is loss perfect? The lost psalm is not yet internally known. To write it again is to unlatch, to transmit. Any poem is constantly written to verb and not to noun, constantly transmitted and continuously translated. Rapid transit makes us dole.  pulling and dismissing our most.

The first funeral tells us this in long hair and soft bodies folding one over another, imagined rain in an unstilled grief. Everywhere in the house, garden beyond it, there is measured time and space, and a calm in the cool stone cool lovers. I, too, move my naked and immense hands and feet through the old high wooden rooms and then out into trees filtering summer sun onto other forms, other statues outdoors, and rest my long arm as in the kiss  on a slab of the unworked stone. There is a raw desire in the cool but sunny day. Thus I find my way back into stone, its certainty. The garden behind the house, its light and shadows on statues bring memory out with them into the brighter, open air. In the museum itself a woman sits sketching a woman lying along her stone bed. On a bench in the bright sunlight a woman lies beside the figure of another reclining like a cat, stretches and sleeps again in the sun. They both look equally alive.  One asleep in flesh, the other eyes closed, awake in stone. I'm going to read a few new things, which you may or may not notice, but they're sort of different because they're, oh, let's see, eighty six. Where are we now? This is twenty ten, so it's sixteen years, right? Huh? twenty four. Thanks, yeah.  Anybody listen to car talk? Yeah, so they told this joke about somebody online and it's at the supermarket and it's like ten items or less. And the person has all these items that he's unloading onto the conveyor belt and the cashier says to him, you know, either you're from MIT, which means you can't read, or you're from Harvard, which means you can't count. Yeah, well. Not from Harvard, but anyway. All right, let me start with my newest piece.  It's a great way to see if a poem works is to read it aloud to people. Now I have to, again, give you some backstory here. There's a film that came out in New York. It appeared at a couple of theaters and it had a short run a few months ago called an unfinished film. The occasion of the film was that some footage from the Warsaw Ghetto was unearthed no one knew about. I'm forgetting the name of this director utterly.  She took this footage and put together this amazing film with voiceover and so on. And so this is a poem about watching that film. Now, let me just tell you, if you don't know about the film, it's not like it's not like the film footage of Therenstadt. And maybe some people don't know what Therenstadt was, but during World War two, the Germans created a fake or a mock, not a fake concentration camp.  filmed everybody there and people looked well fed and they were doing interesting things and they were happy. These were the Jews who had been brought from elsewhere in Europe and placed there. And it was, you know, it was kind of like a propaganda thing, you know. Well, an unfinished film, the person who devised this film had something very different in mind because rather than just have it, well, I mean, I think initially they wanted it, the Germans wanted it to be for publicity, but they kind of went a little too far or they really got too involved because it's clear from the found footage.  And by the way, there's like a second camera and there may have even at certain points been a third camera. So like the second camera will show the first cameramen filming the inhabitants of the ghetto who are being made to act in certain scenes that have been orchestrated. And in fact, one of the cameramen was found and was interviewed for the film. And there are people who survived the Warsaw ghetto who are also they're filmed watching the footage and then making comments about it. And so the scenes are and this is like early in the Warsaw ghetto.  So there are people who have been brought there from all over, you know, and some of these people have more money than others. And, you know, so I mean, you see, you see bodies lying in the street. It's not that the Germans are not trying to show that, but what they decided to do was to show that and then show the way people reacted to that kind of thing. So they'll have people, they'll, they'll do twenty takes of people who are sort of well dressed and also poor people walking around a body that's lying on the sidewalk or a bakery and there's a couple of things in the window and they'll show the, the really raggedy people looking at, looking through the window and then they, they parade.  The well shod Jews in, you know, as if they're going to buy something. And they do the, you know, you see one take after another. So I think what happened, you know, the surmisal is that somebody eventually realized that this film was was a little too revealing. And it does say something about what, you know, perhaps a need to shame people rather than just, you know, kill them, you know. So anyway, this is, this is my poem about that film. And it, I don't know if anybody knows the poetry of Hugh Sydman, but he writes these.  Very terse.

From the gaming table to the early opener, the risk of needle stick not obvious with the first mescal, though sex traps skirt the dance floor and I its centre, a lavender swirl opaque with dry ice, a paradox of people cloistered in the wild, the state of nature realigning, the recognition in a drama of substances, the solitary actor holding the cup high, projecting his voice at the light etched ceiling, calling for more, the recognition inadequate, a ploy, a foil.  This is a poem called Echidna. Echidna is a porcupine like animal found in Australia. It's a marsupial monotreme. It produces eggs and suckles its young in the pouch. So it's a strange combination of creatures that has a duck. I mean, it has a kind of pointed nose that's quite bony and strange. The closest animal to it is in fact Platypus, which has a duck like bill and is also a monotreme.  There it are, for reasons which will be obvious. Rhythmically burrowing up on the top road in the graded remainders, the swampy contours that look good for digging that you'd like to get amongst and smell, those substratas more than dirt and roots, rhizomic agendas of the feeble eyed, uttering up refrains from where compactness and density are demarcation and territory, where decaying melly root or corpse of storm felled wandoo tan the leathery bag of muscled fluid, the flow of ants as white as Moby Dick, as determined against storms.  the pulpy hull of trees as against the gridded surface. Down here, where the highway is sensed in the movement of sand particles, the erosion is tri cha, determinedly sits. In English, hedgehog excavates. At risk, this bristling heart litters the road with dedication, symbols of the national psyche left to bloat in the sun's blistering, blistering prosody, inseparation that mimes mechanics on the surface by heart, that without footnotes is still recognised as the source of oxygen.  I consider as memory tracking an Echidna with a farmer in jam tree country, locating the spirit of place, as if its being curled in a tree hollow might validate the vast spread of open tillage. But struck by a kind of amnesia, we wandered in a circle tight as a fist, exhuming the deeply choric question of rendering our meanderings into prose, into idle chatter to accompany a few beers in the pub that night, the portfolio of our imagined data presented with detachment as the slow movement.  underminer of our confident lyrical selves, fed ravenously deep in the heart of the forest. I'd like to read something very different now from The Undertow. It's from a long poem written a number of years ago called Syzygy, which created something of a controversy in Australia when it came out. two.

Kyger-Creeley-Hewlett_Complete-Discussion_Location-Unknown_06-19-72	0.0	412.28	 Well, we'd love to get Goldenberg to make this. Design, an appropriate design. Well, you know, like, I hope somebody's gonna really think about the landform of the ponds, 'cause I mean, it really could be special. Yeah, true. Technically, you know, the parameters of technical requirements are really wide, you know. So you can have any, as long as you have a volume, you can have any shape in the ponds. Yeah, and the placement of where you put the ponds is really open. So they'd like to be able to walk among the ponds. They're really incredible numbers of birds.  Oh, that'd be true. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Just the place. I mean, you should, the person that thinks of it has to take more like a part. Where? Yeah, there's a part. Yeah, there's a crawl well there. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Yeah, no matter what you say. Where do you got it? Eugene, when when will it be available for public sale? I don't know. I don't know. It's a really good place to be. I guess I'll be able to take next spring. Do you think the bond issue's gonna bad? I don't know. I think the water's gonna bad.  Like an old tax. Anybody have a cigarette? I don't know. I'm just getting to try to get this vision of cigarettes. But yesterday, what happened? There was like a time where at one point, Flowery said, Okay, Joanna. That's your sound. And you can get by tax. So you get a group sound. And then within the group sound, you have like a series of individual things happening. But the group sound is the basis out of which the individual then gets to and that's his ground.  To say that people are kind of not, I mean, they're not thinking to respond, but they do. I mean, for example, if you have, when children grow up, you recognize as a parent, or as a person that's involved with them, that their language and loads of language change with incredible intensity and rapidity. I mean, the fact, for example, when one of my sons was very young, he could, it wasn't that he could learn in the sense, put his mind to, but that he absorbed, let's say, the ability to speak French within, you know, very short time. And then when we shifted to Mallorca, where the people were speaking Mallorcan primarily, he, for example.  six months was out on the street mocking a French tourist with these Mallorcan kids, not as a social attitude, but because now he was in their language habit. And he factually the French friend came to visit and all the Mallorcan kids would dance around him mocking his way of speaking and David among them. And so then this French friend, knowing that he'd seen David six months before in France and an impeccable French, said something to him in French and David had literally forgotten it. So what I'm trying to say is that the that that advent of sounds or modes of speech all the head is like an endless puppy is like a you don't have to try to.  I mean, you're always writing in terms of the quote of the context in which you live, you know, not merely socially or psychologically. Sure. But physically. Yeah, okay. Like a cross in the air, you're writing them there and it's just I'm still back on, like, uh, the actual voicing of it, which is, um, I mean, certainly you've gone, I don't know how many poetry readings, I mean, you must have gone to end with some of them. And they usually they come up, you know, fairly flat and demanding a certain amount of concentration and some for the sound in it. To me personally, I'm just trying to get the feeling like there's like, uh, music is that rock music.  People are aware of like how you can get off the sound and like a poet's now trying to like use part of that is like It's trying to make the tone or the sound of poetry really start to move a lot more than like a translation from the page. It goes too much like that. It goes back from you get it, you write it down and then your voice in an effort to make it come back to life again but the voice like can it's like a reading voice to all of you. And it just sounds like the voice isn't the voice of the person.  I know, so like when Tom could slow down last night. Right. And pull out some of those, I know they must have been ringing through his head in that strange manner. Right. When she really pull out, didn't you have? Didn't you keep part of that team? Yeah. Well, remember, for example, Bobby and I were reading this radio play together about a few days ago and one paradox that she noted. I came out saying, well, what do you think it sounded like since she has the so called professional knowledge of that whole thing? So I was saying, do you think it was okay? I mean, should we just mail it and I don't wanna listen to it again? So, you know, anyhow, she said, yeah, but she and she noted what was curious with her was that.  There's a section of this play in which one of the people speaking is reading production notes for the actual performance of the so called play. And that's part of the play is reading these notes. And the point is that I was I was reading those notes and she said it was funny was that when you were reading those notes you were you were like you sounded like someone not merely reading notes but your voice became very relaxed and personal and actual as though you were reading notes to me. When you were reading the parts that were proposed as conversational interchange those were the parts that went peculiarly stilted and not that you you know fucked them up entirely but those were the parts that didn't sound.  And one again, one damned dilemma as a writer or as a poet more accurately hopefully is that how to get the context to be that intimate in what you're reading so that the voice comes through in that same way. Because reading something is an intimate possibility as opposed to, you know, otherwise. Yeah, well, I realized that you're reading that that it got into that cozy sense. Well, see I would not be just being read to. Yeah. Which is very soothing and relaxing. I love that sense. I suppose one of the real imprints on my own so called consciousness would be the being read to as a kid, which was a beautiful moment. And also the sense which I've always been shy of.  But I've always truly hungered for is the reading where you're reading to four or five six friends. So that the resonances are completely clear, not clear, but they really have a real you know that.
Lauterbach-Ann_Complete-Reading_SUNY-Buffalo_10-17-01	0.0	378.95	 It'll tell you a little bit about when I come up against impediments, which is often, and then what I do about them, or at least how I did about them in this case. I hadn't written for a long time, and I had wrote a thing, a text, words on a page, and I thought it was appalling, sort of dead and uninteresting, and I was sort of insulted by all this reference to nature, which doesn't seem to be very appropriate anymore.  self lacerating space that I live in. But I was desperate to get something new, because one gets very tired of one's work. So I needed something new. So I did something which was I'm interested in, as I said today in Charles' class, I'm interested in the idea of language as a set of examples, and that its best way of proceeding is by.  coming up with one example or another. And I guess I think of the example as something that is both possibly typical or common in common and something that's also equally an exception. So one of the places, of course, one of the very best places to find an example is in the dictionary because it's full of all these definitions that you didn't know that. So what I did was I have this wonderful little concise OEM.  that I've had for at least twenty five years. And you know how what the dictionary I'm really giving you my secrets here. You understand this. You know how you'll have a word and then it will just show you the way it's used but they won't say the word again because it would take up too much room. So they just give you the example of its use. So what I did was in the process I took this narrative thing that I'd written and I started breaking it up and what I did was that there was there would be a word and what I would do is find these examples and sometimes keep the word and sometimes erase the word.  Everyone's leaving. Is this sort of tiresome? Bye. What can we do? You don't know anything to strangers. Well, we could always lock the doors. Freight edges.

Here find the linear broken below a human form, hard shell of certainty, parody and reverence braided together, tiny beats of the heart, traced back to that other plan eternally existing, the young doing such a thing, the big what's the big cabinet of curiosities, what you may be looking at, unexplained. Now I am newly sad, although my house is fine, a silver pencil, a distinction, a thing for him.  In the gap between sadnesses, a man is talking, and I will come, it is probably a shame, and you are a pattern of tact, come to deceive us, but I, I cannot the infinite, as a child, no harm, but I'll try aloud, not guessing, I would have telephoned thirty miles much, well, highly, over what I have said, so thought abraids first proof.

The dream ascends its microcosm making not sense, and the atavistic goons clash at the edge of the park, sky sky plumed, all prepared for the haunted baliwick of strangers trailing incognito across the tile.  But the light seems musical, lowered against the ridge into extremity. Shift, shift, shift. News of the earth. The fabulous knee deep in mud, fist green, tinsel dripping by degrees, blue shoe left in the meadow, the sentence elongated and drafted onto the unsheltered war zone. It could have been dark, theatre of dark, the unsheltered sentence bloodied, the sky opaque, the glassed in record, the will to rise. Call it the person. Things will go then to sleep as if forgotten, and the difficult will seem easy.  Show the precarious struts, set off bombs from above. There will be no one to count, no two to include, no three to beg for mercy. The trail of time will be easy to follow. Good old oaks, billowing lilies along the roadside, no four to divide, and the valley is incrementally cold, down up, down, down, mediated by the memoirs, fake torture, and the one way war, panic of recognition, dangerous evident sun. But in the slovenly, small eyed dream, surely one of us is victorious, our kisses stamped into wet clay, our harrowing ended in song.  Hurrah, while the small struts of tomorrow fall to ground, and the tears come from afar in new boxes. This is called Marjorie and Forrest in Moscow. I went to a reading, Marjorie Wellesh and Forrest Gander. Marjorie and Forrest in Moscow. Trickily absorbed into ecphrastic juveniles.  Shot from the hip, think I'll listen to Emmy Lou, before the fervor of the Andante. Shostakovich plural and harmonic, but repeated over here in the mud, with the young boys with their tools, their faces sweating with boundary, old goat with his belly, lust for the worldly arena. O woman of emendation, man of domestic glass, come speak to us before our trip, upbraid these vague hems and such quotidian enunciations as the Tao, beyond what we might have witnessed in the early homespun riot before the colossal carried us off into infrastructure.  Inverting the usual designation of boy girl trails, she would track the insignias of thought, thinks the bleachers will hold, he would open each flower, blossom heart, in the applet of a kindly disciple. Moses, one shoe off, rises to the tinsel bush recursive, belonging to her own edition, like a good logic, marries Myakovsky to the sublime, submits her throat to the ear, his entreaty to come through the door, impasto of rival concordance, dance of agreement, trot, trot to the beat.  It's going very quickly. I'm almost done. Let's see, I keep talking about whole fragments, but I really don't know what they are. This was called Fragment Oscillating History and Magic. That's, I think, a reference. I'm so ashamed. About the duty on wine, about the barricades, about the arcades. A mere as if the wine duty in the town gates sponsored.  Palpability, density, crassly and roughly omit, calling things by their names mere facts. But in what shall I believe, now that the sanctions are lifted? The sky was bewitched easily the first time we saw it. Remember, do you, do you, now that it is overcast? Snow fell, yes, stuff kept above, as in a studio set, so that the hero dies, but does not, and the girl radiant beyond, and the girl radiant beyond nature, and the river a blast of withering cloud cast upon the old, captive blue. Will the blue come down to us?  paintings along the V cut into a country road and explained on the wall. So in my computer I have this thing called drafts, poetry, drafts, you know, poetry, drafts, poetry, not drafts, finished poetry, they get sidled over. Maybe you all do this, but I have this long list of drafts. So in desperation I looked in the drafts to see what there might be. Is there drafts that I can draft into, you know, the other condition of the non draft?  So I found this. I thought, oh, this is sort of vaguely interesting. And usually, I mean, again, this is, you know, a confessional moment. Because I don't know in any way what to title any poem, I usually just say what month it is that it's being written in. So, you know, there's a November and there's a December and so this is April.Doc.April.Doc. So sad, really. So much pathos in April.  Oh.

Really bad soap scum. And the segue was like, it was incredible. I felt like I felt like Hannah Wiener was communicating with me and had a kind of clairvoyant moment. It's like TV, you know, can be great sometimes. Melt after Stein. You can see the movement of them to be obvious. Somehow one simple, innocent doesn't move.  that no longer exists. The speaker, writer, is probably between things and words. A chocolate bar from a dispenser. It's about distance. A triangle in the distance, a jet plane overhead. I wonder what it says. An amalgam of things the word has taken you in its craft. Sometimes listen to him who are certain. Too much rain made of trees, a single tax. The idea of the story is very often the same. Something to complete our capacity for escape, in particular to wend names spoken together capable of moving, the role of silence is to restore objects.  So much useless suffering. All there is of a fist is a question to adopt. A whole soldier, any whole soldier, does not mean paper. And making a choice, taking care of themselves by themselves and not helping them. So comforting that you are compelled to bring to a righted place after the disturbance of a phone call or disjuncture. What's worth what? The measure of force enters the form of the whole thing. Slashed nostril, paper black. The nervous system, from North Dakota to an eternal conclusion.  It makes a difference if I send this page through the dominant coalition of interests. Look at that apple colored luggage. Look at that tawny port. Purple clouds to Bruce. From purpled foreheads, speechless, over the broken human bodies, the night is bending, decomposed, fled. Make mistakes in psychic income, justice, encoded antinomy. This isn't about inheritance of world self. You find problematic a capitalism of aesthetic agency.  Rampant in the formalism, too much logic is lemon, postmodernism versus the color pink. Out of the purple speech filled night, bodies bending beneath income, problematic as pink lemonade is sweet, stolen car parts decomposed, the formal logic broken. I am the voice, I am the pronunciation of my name. Whoever hears these pronouns, unemployed persons, the slow work and its occasional light lives of another shelter from snow.  wind. A vertical light without shadow, like those everyone had known. Points of landing which were never filled. It says, This essay was once a liquid, light rain in Central Park. A little man made of stinky cheese, golden eared, coiled, resembling a gnat. These senses twist upon or around themselves. They are shaped like an old fashioned sandal. They digress, delay, deviate from the normal. Do they? A varietal identity, epiphetic, not parasitic. A simple melody, a symphony, mothering. How would they know these?

The bondage of karma, the dripping branches breaking out of the carriage and looking up, tansegrity, tangled, we might be sin, we live without. Shooting in a big, bad baby bird sky. It has gotten hard to say dynamite, anything. We eat too fast for arguments, geometry, evidence.  Silence equals brute force, cropped images amplified, I agree.

I'm going to read just one poem from a newer project called Love Kills Hate, in which I spend a lot of time sort of looking at things that are going on in Latin America. And I don't know if any of you caught G Jack on Democracy Now last week.  But he actually had some issues with people looking at Latin America and said, you know, whether you're looking at Venezuela or Bolivia, we can't use what's happening there as a model. And I said to my beloved spouse, Jen, I think that that's a really simplistic argument. And she said, I'm going to write to Jijak and tell him that you think he's simplistic. So in any case, I'm still going to go ahead with the project. And I'm going to read one poem that's a translation of an excerpt from a book by a poet named Florencea Wallfish, who is a year older than me.  in Argentina, and she went to Oaxaca in ' ninety seven, at the age of twenty seven, and was really struck by the melding of people from different cultures and living in what she perceived as a harmony. And then, of course, between ' ninety seven and two thousand four, when the book was published, all kinds of very dramatic things were happening in her home country of Argentina, which I imagine influenced this text. Oh, and the book is called Soup of Garlic and Mezcal. The mirror, disrobing anterior memory, not redundant.

Where she says that she must say newborn, tentative, or animal, she puts her lips to the pain until she pulls the body slowly from the root. Where she says she must hold a great aim, the presence of which does not yet exist.  She must say the body of herself that reappears in the center of her name she releases. Where she says she must say she is not consumed. Where she says that she must not say that. Where she says I kissed you all over, she must also say I always loved you. She wants to bankrupt her skirt of its creases as if she could possibly. Creature shouts in the middle of the dark. Stumbling over shadow falls.

The deliberate spacing of the fence posts was as plain as the apparently undeliberate spacing of the clumped wild iris, the iris in the field that the fence kept the sheep from. But this was when the fence was new and is not what the fence is, bulged, where the sheep have leaned, not one of the posts straight, broken in places, the regular spaces in abstraction.  The rectangles are untrue, and through the holes the sheep have passed from one field into the next field, cropping the wild iris, and lessening the apparent distinction between field and field. It is dangerous to say, with the words rusting as the old wire fence red where the galvanizing has worn off, whether the fence has suffered a kind of death, or whether the fence stands, askew and broken, as a sign of separation.  the death of separation, the fence inseparable from that place between field and field. THE NIGHT SEE Under the rain the trees like crow feet scratch, tangling the spittle's sky. These are the elements that give my heart ease, and make its watch run regular as the rain, solemn as the crow, its claw grip into the wet returning wind. The blear watering face is washed and smeared  The ditch running ruinous page, One page for each year of my age, And each caw of the mind is the watery rage That my tears pay for my tongue's release. But never again for time telling heart ease, Or the song that fills the true shape of a pain, For the heart is struck by the frog spearing rain, And is washed away, Without feature, or the mere fire that dropped on its first birthday. Night flooding fog at the eaves of the year, All unwilling inward.  It quenches like fire, drenched in a hulk sea smothered and swallowed, towed under the wave, stowed safe home again from the wakening rain, that freshens green crests of the scudding hills, rakes the clean air, launches crows from the field. It is under the night sea, the uneasy grave of sleep I am sown, laced in a jacket of ills, bedded naked and wheeled down the shafts of the swallowing sea, to wake once more to the rap of the heart speaking rain, in the spittle dawn, aged in the old  birth of the first day, and I thirst again for my cold death that spoke me oblivion, paid my wage that my tongue should speak. It was deceit, deceit, wind riding like the hurly burly crow, shadow falling upon shadow in the field, the yield picked clean, not a grain but green caught before its spring. Damp rot in the husk reeks, no rainbow nor fathering of the swinking sun can raise what was laid down in the mothering mire, but picked clean  before, oh, an eternity before its first day's dawning. And the husk can rattle in the rambling wind, swim in the streaming seas among islands of crows, but it goes blind and mindless under the coffin nailing rain that sands the husked house thin, as the bony, starved crows clod to the fence. They have eaten the silence. The fig tree.  The leaves, large for so small a tree, moved one against the other in the deep green air, and the light, amid bays and inlets of the leaves, rippled, where the ripe figs hung, purple in that green pool, almost bursting in the cool water of the air. It was fearful to plunge, although all summer's ripeness hung there, in the deep pool it moved, rippling in the muscular light and shade, and it was fear in its multiple same figs.  The rank ripeness of the fig swelled of an abandon fearful to reach to. Heavy and filled, the burst figs fell at intervals in the afternoon, and I saw in your eyes, still in that pool of air, the livid bruise of the same indifferent fall. The hawk's cry from the tall sky fell.  But my hazel eye Against a blue and lidless eye Was set, my stare Went only into blue distance, wastes of air, Each augury of hell Invisible to my sense. There was an eagle, set On a moulding book in the attic Full of moth holes he was, Yet terrible in my childhood. I pulled his feathers, but they stuck, And dodge as I would, His blind glass look Spoiled my young luck. Wife and child brought new eyes to feathers.  flesh that had grown wild in the high wood of a green world.

Of course, she had last minute revisions here, of course through the age of imaginative memory I may be creating a clearer picture of Helena than I actually saw, or perhaps even overstating my first impression of her. But it remains that over the course of my life I have encountered certain faces that, unlike the other millions that pass by, form a clear and permanent image in my mind. A few such faces belong to people who I only met once, others to strangers, and then of course still others to my closest friends. I can still see Helena's face as though she were sitting right here in front of me, questioning me with her.  the look she wore so often. I never saw this look, nor the essence of her face, captured successfully in a photograph, for it was her movements and changes that made her remarkable. She was, it turned out, exquisitely dependent on the transient energy of an animate life. Whether I knew this the first afternoon, whether I knew that first afternoon she would soon inspire me to great imaginary acts of life is unimportant, for in the realm of the possible ideas are unstable, and the only comfort is, finally, your belief that they are true. Helena's faraway demeanour was always somewhat present.  The poems she brought to class were complex enough to send the rest of us into an unusually lengthy, if full, silence. These poems, usually ten to fifteen lines long, looked clustered and smeared in their small Xerox typewriter face. She signed them in pin as though she were a ship, HM Bennett. She had a peculiar vocabulary and sense of poetic narrative, and as she read I thought I could hear each word weave and twist into the lines and stanzas. Scratched beaks spit in sullen ears unhindered, Thy hands turned newly brittle and to bone.  These lines from her poem Odin's Rovins are the very first that struck me. The hard sounds of the brittle beaks and bones, mixed with the mythological allusions, sent my mind into a whirl. When later I looked up Odin, comma Ravens of, in my Edith Hamilton, I found this The nurse god Odin, unlike Zeus, is a strange and a solemn figure, always aloof. On his shoulders perch two ravens. Each day they fly through the world to bring back bring him back the news of men. One raven is named Thought and the other Memory. The implications of such discoveries made a little wedge in my psyche.  tiny aperture through which uncharted thoughts had a new point of entry. On this recent threshold, thought and memory met up with a barely distinguishable mass of desire, and from then on worked together to perceive this new beauty of created forms. The possibility that poems could be much more than inner feelings began to unfold in my mind, and I saw the poem as a made thing, thought out and constructed no less than the pattern of intricate tapestry. As when I held in my very first snowflake, I was stunned with disbelief to look down and see, out of one frozen drop, the most perfect crystalline form. So my new understanding gave me the clarity I needed.  to write a poem, as Robert Duncan wrote so beautifully, that is not mine, but is a made place. That is mine. It is so near to the heart. Okay. You can tell I'm from California that I just held my first nose like very recently in my life. This is from the second chapter. It's called Echo Oom, which is the secret of hidden intelligence. In this, I'm jumping back into my past. I discovered the duplicitous nature of language quite late in my life. In my family, correct English was possible.  My mother and older brother Robert had a fixed idea about words which were either right or wrong, correctly used or unforgivably misused. Using this strict principle, they created elaborate vocabulary contests to try and catch each other in the middle of an unintentional malopopopism. They sought out obscure words and used cleverly planned conversation topics to showcase these words. My mother would trap my brother and then he would return the favor. As I watched from the sidelines, the two of them turned a large vocabulary into a finely honed tool of intimidation. This vocabulary weapon was compounded when my brother Robert obtained a two volume set of the condensed Oxford English Dictionary.  through a mail ordered book club offer. It came in a blue cardboard casing with a magnifying glass in a long thin drawer at the top. He would sit at our dining room table underneath a wrought iron Mexican chandelier and scan slowly slowly down its pages, chuckling to himself. Then he'd get my attention by saying, Hey Jen, a response to which would inevitably unleash a question such as, Are you a nymphomaniac? It was the continuation of a relationship based on his knowledge and my lack of it that had begun on the day I was born five years younger than he. I was about nine when I finally caught onto the perils of this information imbalance.  Robert had decided to tell me that an orgy was a party where little girls play jacks. I got into big trouble when I asked my mother if my friends and I could have an orgy on the kitchen floor. Growing up thinking language was full of booby traps, so for the express purpose of revealing my ignorance, like a dress that could at any minute fall away. One would think it unlikely I would eventually become a poet. I suppose I must have become addicted to the unique humiliation and constant insecurity, actually growing to love the unstable ground of lingual trap doors, or at least I found a method of navigating through them sufficiently fascinating to outweigh the peril.  My friend Katie and I co founded a good word club, of which we were the only members. We never clearly defined what quality made a word good beyond our simple agreement upon preference for it. How the word sounded was, however, a huge factor in the word good for acceptance into our pantheon and all the ensuing privileges of favored status.

A female will to hide the most evident God under a cover, surely infinite thing. Surely infiniteness is the most evident thing.  Is it the courage of women to assume every burden of blindness themselves, intruders, carrying life, the young women, carrying life unaided in their arms, in the streets weakened by too much need of too little, and life seeming to depend on women burdened and desperate as they are?

We saw the old farmhouse, propped and leaning on its hilltop, on that island where the ferry runs. A poor lobsterman, his teeth were bad. He drove us over that island in an old car, a well spoken man, hardly real, as he knew in those rough fields, lobster pots in their gear, smelling of salt. The rocks outlived the classicists, the rocks in the lobstermen's huts, and the sights of the island, the ledges in the rough sea, seen from the road, and the harbour, and the post office.

This called Power the Enchanted World is a series of five very short terms. Streets in a poor district, crowded, we mean the rooms. Crowded, they come to stand in vacant streets, streets vacant of power, therefore the irrational roots.  We are concerned with the given that come before the swallow dares, the winds of March, black winds, the gritty winds, mere squalls and rags. There is a force we disregarded and which disregarded us.

And they're very French in the sense that, you know, it's kind of like French theory. You're like reading along, what? Can you run that by me again? And I liked the way this quote was similar to a lot of the pieces in there in the sense that symmetry in math, a symmetrical equation, it's the same in both directions. You go through all of these procedures, and it's the same. So nothing actually happens, but all this stuff happens, and so you start out with the same.  at either end. And I was interested in that idea. So it's a kind of stasis, and then symmetry is a kind of stasis. But it's a kind of quivery stasis that isn't really stasis, because it just then it sort of collapses, and then you have a kind of antistasis. So this quote seemed to do that for me in a way that was interesting. And the only thing that I think that you take from it is a sense of symmetricality and that persistence in the situation. And that relates to my reading of David, which is to say you just have to stare into it and persist. So I was just interested in Nuvo.  It doesn't seem very explanatory as a quote. It seems anti explanatory. And yet it seems kind of to have a nuance to or, you know, a numinous quality to it that I liked. That was very clear informative what you just said. Oh, good. You know, I'm thinking that's wonderful. So things change only through some collapse of the stasis of symmetry? Well, yeah, symmetry, as you point out, symmetry and not symmetry are the same. So symmetry assumes lack of symmetry.  How do you ever get to change? I mean, how does one get how does one how does one think that through so that how can one articulate that statement so that change is so that the fact of change is encompassed? Think of death. Yeah, I know. It's change. I mean, there's there's somebody and I was just in Buffalo and somebody said asking me a question and it was what's your position on change? Do you think change is good or are you against change? And I said it just you way don't have change.  And it just sneaks right up on you when you just least expect it and changes. And when things are bad, you think that change is good because things are bad and things will change. And when things are good, you don't want things to change because things are good and change will be bad. But you always want something else, so you want change because you think things are going to get better. Things are not going to get better. And it's amazing that we think might as well. That's true. If the newspaper would review them, they'd call them bleak. Well, if you don't think things are bleak, you're not really grasping what's going on.  Yeah. Well, that kind of brings up for me the question of this one might call the social imaginary of using a counting system. For example, David, you've been using ten lines and you're inventing this sort of combinatory twenty cones, ten lines each, various combinations. Is there anything that you attach to of larger social import to the use of that sort?  of counting structure other than merely as a means. No, absolutely. Everyone counts the same. Everyone in this culture counts the same. So, I mean, we're agreed on ten and twenty and how you get there. So, because, well, it's hard to single one book out, but certainly this book was concerned with epistemology and how when the words never mean exactly the same thing for any one of us, nonetheless.  Society is possible with it. So I was looking for things like I was thinking of things like teaching children to read, teaching children to count, and how that is there as some kind of outside to each one of us, although it's inside us. That's why it's outside there. It's inside us here. I could say more about that, but it seems more useful to keep responses to it like a paragraph. When you said everyone counts the same in this culture, I thought, boy, that's way not true. Because I thought you meant No, no, but they should. Some of us are more equal than others. That's right.  Yeah, but that's also, but that's the way you heard that statement is also correct for this book because I believe there's quite a bit about social inequity in this book, although it's not called by the usual terms, just that they because they're limp. Now they're limp, limp after being so long engorged, they are now limp. One of the things that I find really fascinating about this whole process is that it allows me as a reader to watch each of you as a writer cackling.  A not exactly parallel, but the closest thing to it, project in essentially the same space, reading the other's work and then constructing something to say out of that process. And I'm intrigued that both of you, to one degree or another, I would say flirt with narrative in as though it were behind or related to the text, you picking the film that I take it David has not ever seen, even though, you know, which is so symmetrical since the filmmaker has also not seen the film that his film was based on. And I think David does that as well.  Suggesting a narrative he never spells out with funds and marriage and cemeteries and actually never bringing it to the surface but then going back to it on multiple occasions which actually seems closer to the relationship to your text actually and it's relationship and I'm very intrigued at the kind of parallelism.
PhillyTalks3_Complete-Recording_01-21-98_UPenn	0.0	384.95	 So, to me, it was particularly telling and why I find it a compelling argument, because it does challenge in some ways and initiate a bit of a rupture with a poetics of desire and a libidinal economy, but it also initiates this act of pointing, which I see a lot of in work of my contemporaries who are spread out, not located geographically in any particular area, that their work points to particular social facts usually that are disgusting, or not so much of the facts are disgusting.  that people are disgusted by the facts. They're disgusted by their economic situation. They're disgusted by in Canada how, following the fifth term of Reagan administration, America Canada has to mock the same thing and how arts funding is being stripped away and essentially a gospel of facts from the right has been initiated that a debt, a national debt cannot be challenged in any way that the gospel of we can't spend because there's a debt. We have to somehow get rid of this debt before there can be any social.  Any social services left again. So I was interested in it for its ability to make some sort of challenge and rupture, and also because it articulates this movement towards pointing at and registering disgust and anger with these social facts. Having said that, I think that it's also a contingent poetics. I don't think a poetics of disgust, if it gets taken seriously, if it gets picked up by and discussed by anyone, and I hope it does because having spent the time editing the issue, I think it's a really interesting collection of people.  I think it's a contingent poetics, which is something that I see emerging across many different communities, where the kind of larger plans that lead to larger works are being shunted aside in order to have a contingent poetics that's based on a more momentary set of social relations. And then we could again invoke the homology of social relations in the text there, where if social relations have spit up, then one's poetics aren't going to be locked in. How are you going to address a rapidly transforming social sphere with a static poetics? So I see this as a move.  from desire to discuss, but also from a more stable long term plan, which Michel Deserteaux would register as a strategy towards a shorter term tactic of the contingent. I feel it's a bit of a presidential debate sort of here. It's quite interesting. I'm just waiting for the commemorative coins actually. Very, very nice. Oh, it looks so great painted on plates. Yeah. I mean, it sounds.  This is going to be crude because I haven't read the issue. And of the people you mentioned in that issue, I think I know some of the work of all but one of them, but had never thought of them in terms of a collectivity, which is, I think, actually one of the constant sort of underwriting issues that goes on for poets of my generation looking at poets of your generation. Steve Evans today in this poetics email discussion list told me to change my song.  And I responded that I will when it's warranted. It sounds to me from the description as though, having reinvented a Brechtian poetics, there would then be a positing, and I'm not sure exactly where, sort of the inverse, an identified arto, and I don't know who that gets to be, whether that gets to be people of my generation generally or a specific phenomenon.  And it feels to me, in that sense, invariably problematic, because of course, I'm one of these people who tends to think that you want Brecht and Arto sort of constantly talking to one another at the same time. Well, listening. And it seems in that sense to me problematic. It also seems problematic to actually think of the tactical as an advance. And some of what you say in your piece, especially towards Brecht.  at the beginning of that one letter about historical inhibition. I mean, this is a question I think that goes on in society in a variety of different fashions. It shows up again as the five terms of Ronald Reagan in the sense that the fall of Eastern Europe is like this very odd phenomenon. No leftist I knew in the United States, with the exception of about ten.  real sort of retro nostalgic CPers ever imagined that the Soviet Union, the good old Soviet Union, was anything other than this massive deformation of socialist discourse, which also had the funds to subsidize enough people in any given country to screw up their.
PhillyTalks5_Complete-Recording_03-03-98_UPenn	0.0	436.96	 All the texts in the book somehow took place in a space that he defined as the Middle East. And in fact, many of them really didn't or don't in a mental space or even in a physical space. And part of what I was up to there was to include the sense of those spaces in wherever I was. And this is something that I've found to be extremely difficult to do under, again, American circumstances.  Very few writers who are able to do this. And I got permission or instruction, permission in the sense of Duncan's permission to enter a meadow through the wonderful work of Etel Adnan, the Lebanese writer, who, as she says, now writes in English and paints in Arabic because essentially she grew up without a language or with many languages. These are things that can be seen as advantages or disadvantages depending on how you look at it.  atmosphere with displaced parents who had several languages, which were not the dominant languages, et cetera, et cetera. She ended up writing in English and somehow placed herself in American English, but brought in all of this experience. And to me, that was something that was very instructive and something that allowed me to try to think about ways in which places could be themselves and not at the same time. Because I think there's a privilege given to place, which I have tried to somehow control.  test at the same time as I invite it and embrace it. So where I am exactly in all of that is extremely difficult. I mean, there have been a number of years in which I've simply worked in translation because I didn't know where I was in terms of where I would begin my language. That's good. I mean, that's a good answer. How about if we read a little bit and then?  Open it up to discussion. Would that work? Yeah? Can I ask you a question first? You certainly may. No, just I'll repeat it. Speak. I'm actually, this is such a simple question. I'm just wondering what you heard that made you say that's my voice. Oh, well, I didn't, I don't, are you asking that of me or of him? I'm asking you, yeah. Oh, okay. This was a question about the answer that you gave. Yeah. Right. Well, voice is a word that is so burdened with voice.  Theoretical, quasi theoretical, poetic, quasi poetic overtones that I did use. It was the specific word I used when I described this before, but I think I want to back up and try and say that a little differently, because the idea of voice can very easily be confused with the idea of a person or poet having a voice, which is a way to eliminate talking about that person's work and style and method and the results thereof and so forth, pretty much, at least in my view, or for me. So in a way, the question is, what did I hear? And was it a sound? Because the first thing it was, was a sound.  It was a sound of a thought, of a way of thinking, okay? So the phrase that I used that you heard me read at the end of Absent Sensorium, we will crush the arrogant kingdom in our days. That's right from the liturgy, essentially. And there are actually many other things in that that are a way of my trying to bring forward the liturgy. Now, the liturgy, I'm going to take two minutes on this. The liturgy is actually a place where it's an anthology.  And the liturgy that is the standard liturgy of the tradition I grew up in, which essentially is conservative Judaism, which means Orthodox Jewish liturgy, translation okay, is a residue of the rabbis around the turn of the common era of the first few centuries. And then again, another layer from the Safed Kabbalah, especially around the Sabbath. All of the liturgy around the Sabbath is from a lot of it is from the sixteenth century, from the town of Safed, where a lot of Iberian Jews wound up.  sort of very intense, mystical and messianic body of thought that finds its way into that. So what I was hearing, I didn't know that actually at that. I mean, the point at which I heard these sounds, I did not know what this stuff was. I didn't understand I was hearing history, or people, individuals, or an anthology. So for me, what I heard was a sound that sounded like the way I would think. And then when I went and started to look into it, and by no means am I a scholar, and I don't like to pass myself off as one, I'm not, thankfully, which means I can stop reading it when I feel like I know it.  If you know what I mean, I don't have the responsibility to be a scholar. But that's what it meant. What it meant for me was to act what it turned out to mean for me was to actually hear a group, a bunch, a succession of people whose individual intellectual work and poetry, because all intellectual work in that group of people, in that historical group, was poured into this. In other words, they weren't doing science. They weren't actually writing secular literary works.  So that this work that they did that was collected in the Midrashim and in the Talmud and so forth is all of their impulses of thought poured into a single vessel, which makes it extremely rich, at least for me. Just to add to that, there's a phrase some of you may be familiar with Nathaniel Mackie's phrase of music as wounded kinship's last resort, which is something that I've come back to again and again. And it's, I think, an amplification of an idea that.

The first may simply be showing sensitivity to a formal context. The second creates a context. In everyday practice, truths are detected by apprehending cadences. These are confirmed by a kind of subliminal sounding that employs aspects of vision and touch. Charm furthers propagation. They can interrupt or stop anything but true celebration. Celebration, cerebration. Could this have been the first time?  Act of mental freedom. Pierce the membrane between philosophy and poetry, and something starts to leak, then flow. Happiness is always conventional. Irritation, surplus stimulation. Wisdom, does it consist of little more than accepting how long it takes for something to actually happen? If satisfaction is the measure, this is easy to see. Perfection is a kind of surface. Wholeness must be bounded by a shell or skin. To be a unit is to have an outside and an inside.  Place your bets, then laugh, and the game comes to an end so soon. In case you might forget, exaggerate. Adhering to the world by means of glue, ideas are useful mainly when they're wet, but the dry remains fascinate. Reality is like a sea. The world contains many thoughts and few images. Okay, I'm going to read to you.  A few more of these journal selections and then Bruce Andrews is turned. seven thousand one hundred and eighty eight In order to live at the pitch of contemporary life, we acquire the ability to forego the intervals of time that are actually needed to consolidate and make part of ourselves what we have already experienced. Because of the multiplicity of life's possibilities and demands, there is little time for this. Thus, we gradually harden ourselves to accommodate reality and even further forget what it is like to imagine really digesting something.  seven hundred and thirteen. Time out of time. The more I am heard, the more I must resort to silence to be heard. The faster I go, the more stealthily I must move. seven hundred fourteen. The imagination forthrightly encountered can never betray and will always reveal. For this kind of encounter to be open internally, however, is as difficult and consequently as rare as in external encounters. seven hundred eighteen. Life presents itself to us all at once.  All times in its entirety. seven hundred and twenty one. Is it possible to surface unconscious aspects of the identity making mechanism and thereby experience the nexus of the percept coloring process? I think this is done and can be done again and again in new ways by reading and writing poetry. What makes us what we are is determined by what makes us see what we want to see. On a social level, the gradual assertion of the rights of individuals is determined in part by the value the society places on the individual. This value not only determines what a society can do to protect the individual.  But what contributions individuals can make to society? If all individuals are equal, are all individuals then equally expendable? On the other hand, can an individual shed society and thereby transform it? The determination of the value of protecting the individual is also fostered by the concept of genius. It may be that genius is fostered by a mutation of a society's ills with its strengths. Genius has a way of affecting society deeply, although it is always the product of an individual. Another aspect of genius is that it is an idea that returns to all individuals a value by demonstrating that individuals are individuals.  can make a difference in helping reshape society. Just as importantly, the age of machines has intimidated human beings to the extent that they demonstrate the immense potential power of not individualizing equivalents of mass produced parts. Society is tempted to imitate the powerful machine by making its members conform to their ways of producing so uniformly. Of course, the individual soon realizes the value in learning what are the aspects of non reproducibility which are of value. seven hundred twenty six. Anxious, embattled, same thing. seven hundred twenty eight.  So long as a limiting and controlling reality that I'm weary with thinking of it like this. I need new images for time. I am tired of being pushed in front of it like a child being urged to take its first step, or like a pet being dragged along its staccato steps, lurching forward one moment and then seeming to drag on forever, locked in a room, waiting for its chance to get out. I can learn to accept a concept of time that is inexorable, leading to one inescapable outcome, but I can never accept a mechanical view of time that allows for no individual experience. eight hundred seventeen. Every place has its elsewhere.  Not yet completely known, its strange part. We think of the known as the conquistador of the unknown. Two vast terrains, each pitched in darkness, one advancing on the other and the other in grave retreat. Probably a more apropos portrayal, such as may exist between two people, let's say, allows for a more dynamic yet webbed relationship than that. And partly because the two sides are exchanging something vital to both, like a hot potato that neither completely wants, yet neither can completely get rid of either, over time the relationship transforms both. At the boundary point between the two.  There are leaks, clusters of origination, that might erupt briefly but frequently at this peripheral zone, then melt away.
PoemTalk-198_On-three-Larry-Price-poems	0.0	361.88	 And the whole personification that happens within your work, and especially there, it's so that whose monologue is it, so to speak? In a monologue, any one idea stands on stage for seven seconds, as though the idea has somehow become the presenter of the monologue. That's right. I mean, the question really becomes, why are we writing? Who is it that's writing? Why did that start writing? What started writing? What is writing to what? And so on. I mean, there are all those questions.  Is it, you know, an eye? Is it an eye? And I'm not so sure that I want to invest everything that I'm doing in any particular place, one place, because I think, you know, time and space are always going to be complicated. And I don't think the writing comes out of any one place. I think it comes out of this, as I've said, this molange of debris, forces, factors, operators. It's, you know, it's complex. And so, yeah. But I'm really interested. But curiously, here, you then, but you and I are here now. Well, I love that.  Trying to bind. Right. I mean, you put it's an address, you know. To the supposition. I love I'll be, Andy Warhol, I'll be. In other words, we're going to try some identity on for size. I will be, and you will be. Okay, everyone. You be. You be. You be. Oh, I guess you were talking about like Walgreens or something. It's an over and I'll be. Oh, sorry. That's over. Kicking at a bee. This is what we get with Bill, with the nice rest. That's right. But it's not I'll be George Patton. I'll be some solid character. It's Andy Warhol, of course.  actually a mirror, you know, whatever Andy was not interested in identity and selfhood. And so if you and I are here now, seems like a solid social sociality, you know, an agreement that we can be meaning, we can make meaning together, we can co create this thing that's happening here maybe in this poem. And then in doing so, I'll be Andy Warhol and you be everyone else. What we've established is a persona that is an anti persona. And set against that is a kind of an entire audience, maybe everyone who reads this poem or who is sitting in the crowd.  It gets to be everyone else, but it's not distinct from the I, because I will be nothing, and you will be nothing. Anti Ted Talk. Anti Ted Talk. Say a little more about anti Ted Talk, because I think Ted Talk, I don't think that Larry was thinking of Ted Talk, but that is everything that's wrong with speaking to an audience. Yeah, I think it's dislodging monologue from like its authoritarianism, and it's making the poem's existence is an invitation for connection between audience and speaker. So it's inviting the collaboration of both parts that create the occasion for meeting anyway.  You listen. I know you don't. It says, which comes in parts of certainty the monologue doesn't have. It's certain because of the relationship, not because of what the monologue is saying. That's right. Before, we were talking about the eye, and I was disowning the eye. But at a certain point, you actually have to own up to it. You have to say, all right, I'll take this on for this moment, just for the absolute fact of connection. And that's not ironic in the least. That's actually quite seems undercut ethical. Absolutely, it's ethical. But is irony unethical? I don't think no, it isn't, of course. Yeah. But the problem with TED talk ism is that.  The implication is we need more than fifteen minutes of fame. We need to have a serious conversation, and I've been through this, and you're an audience who's listening to me, and it's usually very personal and very philosophical. But it's in fact fifteen fucking minutes of fame, a TED talk. You're trying to get through you want to get to a place that's more than that, I think. Absolutely. And I mean, yes, I can't say anything more than that. I mean, I really agree with what you're saying. I think that, again, we've got.  Lots of straw people around, and they walk around looking and sounding very important only because we elected them. And we can just diselect them, I think. And when we do that, we get to take up altogether different roles in some kind of cooperative. In this case, it's all stages of drama, but obviously, you know, it's everywhere that we are. So Bill, another thought on this piece before we turn to the third one? Well, Eamon, I love this typical inversion that we get here between a crowd and an empty stage, or a stage and an empty crowd. That's kind of unfortunate, isn't it?  I mean, I didn't want to imply that the crowd was empty, altogether empty, but I think that there's a possibility that a lot of times it is because the crowd comes with expectations that invest the performance with more solidity and importance than it actually deserves. And to me, all that does is empty the crowd's expectations onto the stage where those expectations didn't act out. I don't want that. I want complete contingency. I want the accident, the unpredictable. I want to feel that there might be all kinds of encounters that happen at any given time. We just need to be open.  And embedded in though in that.

Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09	0.0	487.93	 I had a question about for Laura Smith about her talk, and it's a follow up question in relationship to what John Ratellik said about the some of the problems with rapture, rapture, or the troubling nature of using those two when you're looking and thinking about not just the relationship between bodies, the violence done to bodies, the history of bodies in relationship to one another, particularly since you were doing your piece on Akeelah Oliver, and since she's specifically invoking the issue of not just the issue of slavery, but the instruments of torture done to bodies through slavery.  Um, I don't know, you know, um, Sydia Hartman's scenes of subjection in which she talks about kind of, not just the kind of rupture in relationships of bodies, but the pleasure, right? I mean, that kind of, the dangerous forms of pleasure. And I'm wondering if you could speak to how, obviously you couldn't do that in a very short presentation, but how, because I know this is part of your work in a larger project, how does your work deal with when you put those things together in conversation? How does it deal with those, with the troubling dimensions while at the same time not abandoning your interest in exploring Oliver's work in this way?  I mean, I think that my answer to that and my response to the link between rupture and I'm sorry, rapture and its religious connotations are the same. And I think that this is what I'm so interested in in what I see as Oliver's repurposing of the idea of rapture. It's still embodied in her version. And I think it's secularized. And I see this I've been seeing this across such a lot of queer and trans work that I'm seeing these very radical trans bodily identifications.  that are very located, very raced, very gendered, very specific, very aware of boundaries while they transgress. And that's intensely paradoxical, but I think that and I do think that there's this crux about transcendence that that work is thinking about and thinking about something that feels very paradoxical between locatedness and relationality. But I do think that the metaphor of rapture gets local, it gets secular, and it gets involved.  Now, I wanted to notice something and maybe have some people comment on it. I was curious in my notes on Jones talk, which may not have been the segue in Jones talk, I have written down alterity within the self, and the next thing I have written down is reciprocal alterity. Now, having alterity within the self has been commented on by Natalie Randall. Body stuff full of mine suggests alterity by Trish, including in the last comment about Trish.  And then going towards transcendence to solve the problem of the alterity within the cell. And by Ronaldo, in a way, in one of the acquaintances, leathered fishnet. And so I was wondering how when you have alterity within the cell, which is patent and like being played out and commented on, one also can produce a reciprocal alterity with the other. Because it seems as if the players have multiplied. That is, if every cell has alterities of various kinds. And the ethical goal is reciprocal alternate reciprocal.  Cyclical alterity. There's been a morph into a polyvalent space. This is very, very interesting. And that's what I noticed in the terms of a relationship among a lot of the things that have been said. And I wondered whether, if anyone else noticed it, they would like to comment on it. That is the echo problem, the cyclical alterity when one is fissured in a variety of ways. Just a small mathematical question. Subject other, subject alterity within the space.  subject and subject other abject. And I think that, you know, with regards to the Labynasian question of, you know, the feminine and the other and that then becoming confounded with women and the question of whether women then occupy the masculine relation to the feminine, this sort of framing what is left out of that is actually and in between a sort of destroyed ground which might be the enemy, the Palestinian for Labynas. It might be it might be the unmarked, the unreclaimable body. And so for me, the ethical question has less to do with.  The constituent of misrecognition between our own alterity and others, which is an asymmetrical landscape, and we're negotiating, but the further violence of an unmarked terrain, which enables even flouting self other. So putting the third animal is really putting a third space, Patrician Quiddian, which is actually not a dialectic, but it's some other space.  With what's just been said, I think that the moment one recognizes alterity in one's self, one is recognizing the reciprocity of alterity. Alterity is not only about others outside of one's self, and I do think that the vectors of alterities go in many directions. That in itself is not a very full statement, but it leads to a question.  or raises questions of the nature of practices within a world scape where you can be mapping reciprocal alterities rather than mapping us then alterities. I have a question about that, Darren. I think on the one hand, it makes a lot of sense that that is how we get there. But I think I'd also like to say it's possible to recognize good things within yourself and not relate to still being.  to bring together and not monopolize. Not move in that way that we have the ideas of ethical relationships. So one can say, you know, I recognize this and that you and not you. You know, for sure. I wanted that to be done. No, I think it's, again, I think it's one of those necessary but not sufficient matters. But that you certainly can recognize otherness within yourself.  But in order to begin a dynamic of precipitation.

I saw the dog a hundred feet away, a burly fellow, half chow, I thought, half German shepherd, shaggy hair plastered with mud. The dog saw me too, and came running towards me. I walked on, afraid the dog would bite. I could hear the nails of his paws clicking on the pavement, but he passed me, never looked at me, and ran along as I walked, ten or twenty feet ahead, ten or twenty feet behind. I did not like his looks at all.  The heavy brow, the square jaws, a shaggy, dirty fellow. The road was as lonely as ever, marsh under the blazing sky, and the motor cars went speeding past. I could see the pavement of the street on the other side, and the bright blue sea. It would be cooler there, and I might be rid of the dog. The dog looked up after a while, saw me on the other side, and came towards me straight through the traffic. I stood stock still, waiting for the dog to be hit. Sure enough, the second or third car struck.  and sent him sprawling on his back, squealing. The brakes of the car screeched. The dog leaped to his feet, was knocked down again, and then came running towards me. You dope, I said. But I was touched at his devotion. Now we went on side by side, the door close to me, and I no longer afraid. Now and then we came to a stairway leading to the beach. Below other dogs were running about on the sand, and the dog was eager to go down. But he stopped, waiting for me at the head of each stairway.  The street turned at last, and we were back on the highway. Now I was afraid to cross, for fear the dog would be hit. He stood beside me, looking up at me, watching my hands and feet, ready to spring forward. At last there was a break in the traffic, only two cars coming. I could cross easily, go part of the way, let the cars pass, and then cross over. But I was afraid the dog would rush on and be hit. No, I said, oh no. And we walked along the edge of the highway without crossing. As the dog ran on beside me, sturdy and true, I thought it was.  Lifted face, the deep brown eyes watching mine. Yes, I should like to keep him, walking so together. We came to some houses. These were at the sea, cottages, refreshment stands, even a small merry go round. I stopped at a stand. What should I get my dog to eat? I asked the pleasant girl behind the counter. She smiled at me and leaned over the counter to smile at the dog as he stood beside me wagging his tail. Hamburger, she said. Dogs love it. All right. One or two, two. She took the fresh dog.  Cakes out of the ice box and put them on a square of wax paper. I walked to the corner of the stand. The dog followed and I put the meat down. The dog looked at it, his tail drooped, his eyes were glazed with fear, and he was off as fast as he could go, bolting over the sandfills.  I think as you heard the young lady read some things I call testimony. Now the first two I did with this name were in this by the waters of Manhattan. Now they are based the testimony are all based on cases in the law reports. And this is the first there that I used of the two. The company had advertised for men to unload a steamer across the river. It was six o'clock in the morning, snowing and still dark.  There was a crowd looking for work on the dock and all the while men hurried to the dock. The man at the wheel kept the bow, kept the bow as you held the launch against the dock, the engine running slowly and the men kept jumping from dock to dock, from dock to deck, jostling each other and crowding into the cabin. eighty or ninety men were in the cabin as the launch pulled away. There were no lights in the cabin and no room to turn. Whoever was sitting down could not get up and whoever had his hand up could not get it down. As the launch ran in the dock.  Darkness through the ice, ice cracking against the launch, bumping and scraping against the launch, banging up against it until it struck a solid cake of ice, rolled to one side, and slowly came back to an even keel. The men began to feel water running against their feet as if from a hose. Cap shouted one, the boat is taking water.
Richards-MC_Complete-Recording_Indre-Studios-Philadelphia_5-5-97	0.0	500.54	 A big evergreen tree stands outside my window. Its roots mumble under the surface. A long concrete divider. Steps three at a time. Sky cloudy and heavy squeezing a thin layer of light against the city. The first red leaves of an otherwise green shrub. The sisters are gone from the convent. The dancers are gone from the hill. Morning has come to its end.  It's noon. The hide of the tree has grown rough scales. The trunk bends its hip to the left and shakes its disheveled branches to a secret music of release. The trunk bends its hip to the left and shakes its disheveled branches to a secret music of release.  Now there's another poem about the morning. Morning prayer it's called. Yes. I'd like to read this morning prayer since it's a kind of call for help. Morning prayer.  Help me, I murmur, as if I knew to whom I speak or what I'm asking for. Sitting in my nightgown for coffee by the window, walking up Third Avenue, waiting in my studio by the clay bins. Oh, help me. And sometimes I hold my breasts and a stronger pulse beats upwards as if my words are both.  Both prayer and answer. Help me as if somewhere a great ear listens to our morning roar. An orbit swings open and the spirit of love like a sharp bite of acid etches the ground and I can lift my foot. Help me to feel your presence in grain and grape. Not to wander as if lost when I am not lost.  Sweeten my breath from the fantasy I am not loved nor touched enough. For ecstasy breathes at the window where I wait, leaps toward me in little gasps of the cock's trembling comb, the hen's groan, the maple catkins hanging like green teats, the dawn's pallor. I am stroked by the darting dapple, Hopkins praised. Help me to feel faithfully your presence.  Riding under the surface in a mighty unwasted current. Jasper, you were asking me about Florida. Here's a poem called Your Name, Florida.  And it is just about that way with the ocean, too. The song rippling along, and the sea in stitches, nipping and tucking. And the river, yes, it is that Indian lagoon, a broad leaf of blue, a vine narrowing and straying. There is that bird place stuffed, stuffed with wings, necks, heads, and outcry. And a thousand settle in for the night's dark needs. Oh, those elbows of birds, pouchy gullets.  Slow motion legs and necks like a shepherd's crook. What Egyptian mystery hangs by a feather on this egret here? And what alchemical right bleeds in the pelican's breast? Yes, that white ruffle of the horizon line, and the ginger sand, the pine poking itself outward in green fringe, hibiscus double yoke, and yoga palms stretched like flying fish.  Breathing deep, the shoreline fills to the clouds, the cliff, and soul drinks in the gale and the song. Heliotrope, sun turned, sun turning, sun, how you do do it here, yes, in this land of swelling air, water, fruit, and flowers, this place of fruitful sun.  Swelling? Yes, that's what it means. Your name, Florida. Now, let's dry out a bit with a piece called How to Rake Water begins with dry water. The pool of tines through sand rakes water into waves. Dry water.  Take the stream of time and rake it into ours. Let the dry flowing future slake the earth's thirst. Water wings whip the great shapes of flying and rake the buoyant water into circles. I am this water and this rake combing my ocean into piles of stone.  Water, spread thin, turns into rain, holds within banks the cup of seas, runs down the mountain's chin and foams in the green beard of trees.
Robinson-Elizabeth_Complete-Reading_A-Voice-Box_Pegasus-Books_04-13-08	0.0	442.71	 This is a morality play. It is preparation for departure. The 'he' and 'she' cause pain with their confusion, though it is unintentional. On homophonic terrain, 'which' or 'which' something trails along after them, slight but not dwindling, while the water laps at the lips now away and now open, one a portal and the other a spell. And this is a little bit longer.  I was certain that I was writing fiction, but I have been told since that it is not fiction. This is as close to fiction as I believe I can come. It's called Crow and Robin. Nearby, I hear the sound of wood planks clunking against each other, and through the trees comes the clack of hammers, sometimes a buzz saw. The man laughs and says, Have you ever murdered a man? His coworker makes no reply. The man begins to sing a song, but stops, interrupting himself with his own laughter.  At home, I sit at the kitchen table and look out through the window at the neighbor's garden. I think about you. Rather, I imagine that I am you. What would you make of the ragged peonies, and why hasn't the neighbor cut them back as they die? From inside your body, how do peonies smell? I am embarrassed by the limits of imagination that is, how my desire fails as empathy and settles into voyeurism. Have you ever deadheaded a peony?  I know not how the old felted browning petals feel, but how they feel to your fingertips. I wonder if I'd ask a stranger, as you must ultimately be, a question arising out of genuine curiosity. I wonder if I'd dare to trespass into my neighbor's flower bed and cut down her ugly, used up flowers. Across the street, Griffin is three and a half. He walks to the edge of the driveway holding a bouncy ball. He aims carefully and then sets the ball down to roll it.  Griffin's one year old sister totters carefully toward her brother on her new walking legs. The ball connects with her shins, bringing her to her knees. Her face bounces down and then off the ball. Griffin retrieves the ball and walks back to the edge of the driveway, starting again. Griffin, honey, calls the babysitter. Griffin. I thought it was funny. Outside my window on the second floor, two birds squabble.  and the other looks to be a crow, big and aggressive. The robin is getting beat up, but stands its ground. A huge gust of wind causes the bough to move from due north to due east. The birds rotate before my eyes parallel with me. The wind carries the package of itself on the arguing bird voices until a pedestrian walks by and the crow, startled, slides off the bough and goes away. I wanted the crow to be ashamed, to leave the branch ashamed that it had forced itself on another bird's home. Then I realized that I am the crow and you are the robin, and a sense of adoration and admiration.  spreads through me like a new version of the weather. The crow comes back again and again, and I hear the raised voices of the birds merging with the bigger, agitated voice of the wind. Is it really wrong to look for evidence that will prove what you want to believe anyway? I often find what I'm looking for on the chain of continuity, the leading to or following from. Here, in the sequence of reason, proof that things may be connected off kilter, without their our realizing the link. This morning, as I was listening to the radio, I heard this story.  A semi truck is pulling out of a gas station driveway. Just as it pulls out onto the street, a man in a wheelchair rolls in front of it and gets stuck in the grill of the truck. The truck driver drives four miles at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour, completely unaware of his front loaded passenger. When the truck finally stops, the wheelchair is detached from the truck and its occupant is unharmed. He describes the experience as quite a ride. That was on NPR too. Could there be more to the crow than its obnoxiousness?  Doesn't it, too, have a right to be hungry, to need shelter? I watch it trying to get its glossy head into the bird feeder meant for finches and sparrows. Very smart. If I were to stand in for the crow, then could I convince someone to love me? I imagine watching you watch the crow, your good humor, but your sense ultimately that this bird is not subtle. A pest you think it should blow away in a summery gust. Coming home from work, I see my young neighbor Griffin running up the empty sidewalk, looking back over his shoulder. As though, I think, with amusement.  I am raking up the fallen mess of leaves and sticks in the yard when I notice that the woman next door is carrying sticks and branches out to the curb. We both continue without acknowledging each other. After a while, I see the man across the street sawing off a half broken branch from a tree, and then that another neighbor is silently raking up debris from the storm. Far down the street, some day laborers are talking animatedly in Spanish. Otherwise, there are no human voices.  In the middle of the night I wake up to terrified screaming. One creature preys upon another. And after the screams, quite near, the wounded animal takes up a desperate snoring breathing. I turn on the porch light and the breathing stops. It starts again, more irregular. I can't see what is out there even though the sound of it is so sharp that it's in my nostrils and on my tongue. I wish you were here to comfort me. But I make my fear correct itself. I would be you, the self at a loss. The invisible hand that rests on the porch light.  shoulder of its own body guiding it.

And I'm going to conclude with a prose piece that's pretty new, and it's part of the Grand Piano, which is a collective, what do we call it, an experiment in collective autobiography. And some of you may be aware of it or may have read some of it. It's an autobiographical work by ten poets who knew each other and still know each other, but who were working in San Francisco.  in the late seventies. And it's been coming out, we've been working on it since I think about two thousand. I mean, it's been almost ten years now, and through correspondence on the internet. And I guess about three years ago, we started completing it and getting it out. And it's been published in a series of small books. I didn't bring a copy, but they're quite beautifully designed. They're kind of nice pocket size. And each one has one section by each of the ten poets. And there will be ten when we finish, which will be with the next one.  And most of the pieces are our memoir. But everybody kind of approaches it from a different angle. And I've found that in doing it, I sort of have to reinvent how I do it every time. So I'm going to read the latest one, and this one, I guess, is just out. I haven't seen it yet, but it's part nine. And in this one, it's more of an essay about sort of the problematics of writing autobiography and thinking about memory and thinking about time, thinking about the time in which the story takes place.  which is kind of back in the day and then the time in which the writing has taken place which really has covered almost a ten year period. And in fact this piece was the first draft of this was written in about two thousand one I think and was published actually was published in the summer of two thousand in Chain magazine in their memoir anti memoir issue which was edited by Gina Osman and Juliana Sparr. The version that appeared in that magazine was pretty short and so as we were preparing a copy for this one I inserted.  A lot of new material, but all the original material is in here as is without any change, but there's a lot more in it now. Okay, so it's called Notes Toward a Phenomenology of Time, and it starts with two epigrams. Of course, when you're seventy three, there are a lot of another times.

The words come with letters pre inscribed. The letters are secure in their variously circumscribing words. The words represent a kind of packaged application of signification. The letters are elements in a toolkit for spelling words. Think about it. Train whistle leaves us speechless. Imagine letters. Imagine letters breaking the boundaries of words. Imagine words breaking open their envelopes, never to be the same.  into an eventually undifferentiated state. Each man is the child of his deeds, and each woman is the child of her deeds. All words are lures, all dreams means, some meanings lost, others mostly dross, the slim files of random data fragged and tossed, the lessons scattered at bus stops, forgotten angles on past lives, situations not right, solo entries onto barren plains, suggesting mighty stories savored late at night, collapsing in piles on hotel room floors, circulating high above commercial districts, emptying out into freeway sounds at night, standing for thoughts never uttered, eyes shut tight against material operations going on as if on their own.

And as some of you know, I've been participating in a group project with nine other poets who were active in the San Francisco poetry scene in the seventies. We've been writing about that time. And we started it almost ten years ago now on the internet as a correspondence. And then about three or four years ago, we started finalizing some of the work and putting it out as a scene.  And we've now done number nine just came out. We've done nine of them. We've got one to go. It's called the Grand Piano, named after a coffeehouse in San Francisco where a lot of poetry readings happened at that time. And as I said, there are ten people involved. Each volume has ten pieces, one by each poet. And a lot of it is pretty straight memoir with recollections and stuff, but they vary a lot from person to person and from issue to issue. But this is the last one that I've completed. And actually, I wrote it.  in about two thousand. And it was a version of it was published in Chain magazine by Jenna Osman and Julianna Sparr. But when it came time to sort of finalize it for the book, I added a bunch more stuff, sort of inserting it between existing paragraphs. So

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Reading_Buffalo_3-6-91	0.0	345.44	 The desert brush is burning. The cocoon of hammock or sack, which is the henned man, is carried by the boys. They're carrying the rabbed cocoon on poles. The earth before them is cracked. But above it it is lined covered by the heavy sky. They trot on it, sticks. It isn't being dead. The only paradise is not being dead. The henned man is, but the boys aren't. From above the lines and ridges of the brown desert, when one is flying, only when one is flying. It is a waste area, and in one's heart, as with an organ pumping blood, it is illuminated. A barren desert with tracks on it, a track leading to a vast lake.  which is a pale blue from above. If this occurs, it goes into it. At the moment it is seen. I saw it when flying. There is a haze of billows of smoke and ridges. Man who's risen by sycophancy is remembered for no reason as defenses. Yet one is continuing and seeing whatever occurs still. Cocoon's sack in which the henned man is swathed and carried by the boys is occurring. Their walking sticks on the cracks is manual. On a hot day rode in the cab across the city and the cab driver played hymns on the radio while singing a different hymn at the same time in a cracked voice. If he wasn't singing counter to a hymn.  He'd murmur about how we have to believe to it. I had the thought he can't be without this in the city driving, because it's occurring. Occurring is in silence, this hasn't happened before. The grasshopper is invisible, and the man puts his member into it, the halves that aren't seen, in the dark. These men who are cousins are construction workers who are nomads for the joy of it, to have a job so as to leave. It comes from this. This is a way of life in which there are no marriages or connections, though there are children. Catching up to the henned man whose head is hanging out of the sack, flickering head ahead on the desert, it's hanging from the cocoon, swaying on poles on which the stick starving boys are struggling.  There is no minute movement. Laying them out on a mat, dabbed to clean them, though the henned man is the one dead who'd been alive for only an instant and they, who aren't, wrapped him and are moving with him toward the billows of fire on the plain. That are spirals. They are not moving to one of these. The swans flap up honking or whooping as they're coming shimmering in a V on itself, so they're simply the thin topaz air. The desert is crisscrossed with a few roads from above. The man loving celebrities and the wife are in a car that has broken down on one out there. They get out and are standing beside it, which is pushed out and is burning in front of them and there's nothing inside them.  Movement is coming from some black robes blowing with no eye holes that are outside them. The man and the wife who's weeping with the burning car outside them. He's quiet, isn't jeering from inside movement that's in him, standing. The desert is outside them and the moon is. It's out in front of them so that it's in it. Bright moon is in front of them. In the desert that's on fire, the black robes are blowing out on it, not in the line of the spirals. They're going at a trajectory with no movement in them. I want so much to be where I was before I was me. Trying to be in the night as day, pushed out and so it is in the day when it is.  The moon is in front, it is on the plane, the moon is in front of me so that there is nothing in me, yet on the rim the girl spits on me for a flicker. The girl spitting on me, her being so immature that the friends stare at me, creating a conformity to which, if I object, I'm merely self serving, it is invalidated by having occurred in me. To be what I am before I am me, it is pushed out in the moon in front which is before rather than me. Looking at the dog lying in the gutter whose thin layer of sheaf of fat is seen on the ribcage which is open, the friends create this conformity which is limpid, occurring before.  They don't have faces staring. Why did one see them before? They'd say it is self serving to see this and so anticipating. Breathing in and out. The breath is in the moon that is outside in front. It isn't in me. So it doesn't matter if one is walking, it is in the trees that are in the blue sky. Birds go by. So the day is in the night at once. I felt joyful these events happen slowly before me. He's holding the tips of the ribcage like fins and the member put in the end comes. Had been on it. It occurs in the present, but before me. Seeing on the street the blue.  Burnished face banged up, walking. I followed him, who'd been on the garbage. He continues walking ahead. Being outside is simple. It's pushed out there. The tool is completely distorting, and having a feeling highlights that putting a lining under it, walking and is in it. This lovely moon that was out there in the day orbed in front of me, the henned man alive for only an instant, had never been alive, and so the breath is outside without the moon. This stick starving boy's trotting on the desert, carrying the cocoon, as seen in reverse. I couldn't sleep and yet couldn't sit up either.  my eyes closed from being tired and therefore immature. Communal is completely simple being outside, only with the moon in front of me, walking with no one there, is not doing anything what one sees inside. It is moving backwards or turned around, the hen and man alive for only an instant who has never been alive is it, and not being myself riding up the street a while ago, people coming out or standing,

A kind of pressing that kind of pressing that Bob was describing as the pressure of O'Hara. Like he wants to have a moment which is kind of big when you read it like on the page. Yeah. But yet as you said before in relation to the poems it like it occurs quickly as a perception but as recorded it seems to somehow want to perceive.  push the limits of what would otherwise be considered a moment. And you also use the expression resonance and duration. I think that that is sort of a kind of a characterization of this mode. Right. Well, it's the conflict between the fact that you can apprehend a huge amount, but you but in order to write that to say it is and the fact that you're unable to write that. It's impossible and also that your perception or your being in the moment, the moment doesn't.  It doesn't exist anyway. So it's attempting to realize that. In other words, that you've completely fabricated this in your sense of the moment. It has never existed and isn't there. So I relate that to that previous question of whether something's being nullified in a sense there is that. It has to be your understanding that you can only exist in the present but you're never in it and that it doesn't exist anyway. So you don't want to be limited by the boundaries of a coherence that itself is.  Right. Well, it's kind of as if if you had the moment as a frame, so to speak, if that made any sense, that you would, the writing will go past, it will kind of go past that boundary, and it will show you that it's past that boundary by being so big or something like that, that it demonstrates that tension of being inside or outside of something. Is it also illusory because it's an example of like what you've been talking about fabricating a sense of the moment or a construct of the moment out of the past, out of what you remember? Is that relevant? Is that relevant to you?  past the moment, you're still writing, that moment is past, you're in a sense remembering something or what it was like when that moment was taking place, which still is not possible. Yes, right, but you would always be it is simply that, but you would always be behind time, even if you're sitting right here. There's no such thing, because if you're in this second, it's already behind you. I'm interested in this whole idea of constructing.  of constructing some kind of linguistic surface or a poem out of the past, out of what's remembered. In a sense, the images like Hera are not nullified because there's still something left over and that is just a sense of what's been constructed out of what he remembers. I'm struggling with it a lot because I'm having a really hard time trying to articulate what I'm thinking about and I have been thinking about this a lot in terms of my work in the poetry of China.  Ashbury, which I think has a lot, which the discussion today of O'Hara's poem has a lot of resonance with. I see him as also constructing this linguistic web and working in like just extended long sentences and that kind of thing, especially in things like the system. But there's still a sense of even though the surface, even though it's highly rotten, rhetorical and superficial, there's still somehow something being remembered into the present of experience.  experiencing that text. And I was wondering if you kind of thought about, I mean, anyway, I mean, this is what, you know, that what I was thinking of anyway is like the work of Ashbury, especially like in his longer, more, you know, more meditative kind of work. So I think it works with O'Hara. Yes. I don't know. But I think actually in both cases, it seems to me, there is this sense of walking down Second Avenue literally wanting to render that present time experience. And the only way to do that is with this enormous background.  And then it becomes about that as well. Yeah, not too late reporting, but I think when we talked about Duncan's sort of Duncan and O'Hara crossed paths in terms of a sense of immediacy or something, I'm afraid I missed it. I didn't quite understand that's what we were talking about. Duncan's not reaching for something that's beyond the sense of its right. Is it impressive as well? Or am I this? Well, I was interpreting this as.  trying to read actual experience and that that is of he would use the vocabulary of saying that is in the heightened sense because actual experience is that. But in other words, it's not something that is removed from one that is in the nature of say of religion which is a doctrine which you learn and which you are distanced from God or you are that and you have to realize that. So you've said it's not platonic reading is God.  as a reflection of something out there rather than the important thing itself. Say that again. I've been thinking about both Duncan and O'Hara in terms of gay identities and poetry and thinking of them very different as interested in this point of intersection that you're talking about. And I've done readings of Duncan in terms of sort of a platonic way wherein experience or the material of what's actually.  going on is not as important as what it suggests in some transcendent realm. And that's always sort of not really work. And I'm sort of interested in more of the idea of hearing this experience. Well, that it's confusing because one doesn't know what transcendent realm or whatever. Because I think what he's trying to do in the HD book is to say, to bring it back to something that where the oneself, where all objects or all beings are the germ of.  What life is and that that is a that's the essence or quintessence of that. It's not abstract. That's what he means by the actual. But then that's so that's what's being read. That's what's being seen. It's the and that's what he means by words like magic or by it's apprehending that aspect of something in the actual being rather than moving it from oneself as a reflection on that as if it were as if more rather than being descriptive.  It's evocative in terms of writing. But that's the whole thing. I mean, it's very difficult to describe that. Just be Duncan, I don't think his impulse or intent is to translate the particularities.

The user friendly exhibit was installed on street corners along South ninth Street and East Pasiank Avenue and between Carpenter and Twelfth Streets. So the seven figures give a thumbnail sketch. Father Antonio Isoleri was an Italian immigrant who became pastor of the first Italian parish in the United States, Saint Mary Magdalene de Pazzi. His service as a spiritual and secular leader from eighteen seventy to nineteen twenty six.  six was instrumental in shaping the future of South Philadelphia's Italian American community. The church remains a worship site while maintaining its Italian identity to this day. Its former rectory serves as the Mario Lanza Institute and Museum honoring the tenor who used to sing the Ave Maria in his old church. Dorothy Allen is the daughter of West Indian and African American parents and was born and raised in South Philadelphia. She is the founder of the Barrett Educational Center in Point Breeze and worked to provide food, social services, job training and a safe haven for children and teens in the neighborhood.  Bill McIntyre formed part of the South Philadelphia community since the area's earliest days. By eighteen twenty, the area around South Street contained nearly three quarters of Philadelphia's African American population. Many newcomers settled west of Broad Street in Point Breeze during the Great Migration of the twentieth Century. Bill McIntyre was a longshoreman and a master welder for the Independent Pier Company. He marched as a comic in the Mummers Parade for many years before founding the Shooting Stars Fancy Brigade, the parade's first fancy brigade. He paraded with his neighbors on New Year's Day for seventy three years.  This back to mid seventeenth century roots. The New Year's traditions of South Philadelphia's first settlers, the Swedes, blended with the traditional mummer's play of the British Isles. After more than a century of informal merrymaking, the first official parade was in nineteen oh one. Fabiola Canto works as an accountant for Marriott Hotels. She helps organize Philadelphia's Virgin of Guadalupe celebration. She was also an active participant in negotiations to increase communication between the Philadelphia Police and South Philadelphia's Mexican community. This community established around the Italian market and is mainly from the state of Pueblo.  The Mexican population in South Philly has grown exponentially since two thousand one. This is due in part to migration from New York City in the wake of the september eleventh attacks. Frank Snock was the son of Polish immigrants. In the early twentieth century, he boxed under the name Johnny Coffee. The young fighter made enough money to open Snocky's oyster house, a neighborhood landmark that has thrived over one hundred years and counting. During the greatest influx of European immigration into Philadelphia, the Washington Avenue wharves were owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. They served as a docking point for ships to unload oysters.  food, finished goods, workers, and future Americans that would travel by train through the city and around the country. Bao Win is a Vietnamese refugee and a respected elder in South Philadelphia's Southeast Asian community. Active member as a volunteer, she teaches traditional Vietnamese cooking classes to young people and promotes health screening for aging immigrants. South Philadelphia has been one of the chief destinations for the Vietnamese immigration in the USA since nineteen seventy five. Philadelphia has a higher percentage and numerical population of Vietnamese than New York City.  Lebanese immigrant grandparents established the family's roots in South Philly, where they opened the legendary Middle East restaurant. An accomplished percussionist who learned his musical craft while working in his family business, Joe has performed across the United States, Europe, and North Africa. The Lebanese community in South Philadelphia dates back to the eighteen eighties. Father Isfahan Korkamas established Saint Marin's, the United States' first Maronite church in nineteen eighty seven. It's located at Tenton Ellsworth since nineteen oh one.  So I got confused. And it continues to play a vital role in the lives of Philadelphia's Lebanese American community. So that's the background. And whatever we feel like is a feel good event. So you can feel good about paintings that speak with their eyes. Feel good about Rome, even though it's far, far away.  It's something we can agree to feel good about. You can feel a poet as priest slash priest as poet. Feel good about smiles at the gates of heaven and Garibaldi as well. Feel good about the ballad of Antonio Isoleri. The icon's eyes have moved to guide a young man into spirit, to direct a poet from the smile of God and give a new father a mission. I am crossing Alps and ocean. Philadelphia awaits. La Superba falls from view from the parish windows around him.  world of faith in what there is to become. What is to become of Montrose Street but to be built as a beam between cultures? The church's saint, a mystical nun, her pastor, a temporal shepherd. On the feast day, her doors open to railroad workers walking the picket for justice. On Sunday, he rails against exploiting our children as slaves. You can still hear echoing whispers, Patria unita under tricolor, unita via the festa. Calabria, Sicily, Abruzzo, Malise, unita before him in marriage.  Shh.

A quality of light underneath the street lamp is how it dampens color, how color itself is a thing imposed as the sun imposes day. Day when it arrives, if it arrives, is layered and must be stripped, though never in the same way twice, if ever we are to discover the pulse at the core. What fiction, what nonsense.  Voices over in the corner, jabbering, with no thought of who listens. The line already is inherent in the upright letter oriented. Speech is not a given. The tongue is infected. It is very cold. Worlds hurtle through the night sky, where it is apparent that day is the exception, that it may even be a fiction, a creation not of light, but of desire. I want speech. Sky, air, wind, sun surround. For want of storm windows, we hung quilts. Birds shake snow from the lighter branches.  One doesn't so much sleep under all these blankets as one does cook. Pencil is a blunt instrument. In a coma, I am told, all evidence of palsy disappears. You yawn freely, widely, the way an infant yawns asleep. I shall not hear birds in these trees again. Words hurtle through the night sky. three. Stripped of furnishings, the familiar house became exactly what it was. An object, alien, a machine, each room a potential or function. There, in the leafless forest, we could see the huge nest high atop a poplar.  Here I can walk to the train, so much assumed in the instant. twenty five bones per hand or foot, three muscles roughly for every bone. Behind that wall, the low hum of the surface. After several days of warmer temperatures, the snow still has not melted, the last mounds dark and translucent, cakes of ice. Odd how, after thirty years, a phrase such as The Beauty, Wapiti, still rings in the mind. Oncoming cars, headlights shimmer dimly in the fog. At the road's edge, back in the streets, the deer watch us.  Without interpretation, the flower's knowledge of its own process is not counted as mine. I walk with each hand bald into a fist. Four. Oh yeah, you're one of the ones who can write in the dark. Thank you, Ron. So we have some time for questions. Molly's got the microphone. Who is going to be brave and ask the first question? And here we go, right in the back there, Molly.  Good morning. So I wanted to talk about the blog a little bit more before it gets too far away from that. And I was really curious, I mean, you talked a little bit about how it's a way to educate people without the filter of the university. Grotesque. Grotesque filter. You like that word. You said it. And I remember a couple of years ago when you disabled comments on your blog. And the reasoning you gave was trolling and flaming. And I know the Buffalo Poetics List serve kind of had the same thing a few years ago. And I mean, the first thing I thought of was a sort of generation.  because I think for the young people in here, we see YouTube comments or these kinds of things that, you know, you know what to ignore and you know what to listen to. So I was curious if you think there is any sort of general generational divide in language we accept, if there's a valuation of language in the discussion that kind of goes on on the internet. Well, actually, it's more a gender than a generational one, at least with regards to the blog. But I'll try and deal with both of these. As my job during the last twelve years ramped up in the amount of time it absorbed.  ability to police the comment section on a daily basis was beginning to extend further and further. There were a number of people, are a number of people, not just on my blog, but elsewhere on the net, who do seem to be completely unaware of the implications of some of their language when they use terms of color and gender, when, you know, there's the joke of the old Saturday night live routine, Jane, you ignorant slut, when somebody hears themselves called out on the weblog by somebody whose name they know it's actually less pleasant.  And not catching every one of those every day meant that I was having a reaction that was, I think, dividing my readership by gender so that my blog was becoming more and more of a male space. And with all the negative aspects of the male space.

Ah, swoony, queasy feel, as you squeeze lightly now my balls, the strong odor of his own urine. Standing over an open ditch in the pouring rain, think of the word gully washer. My bones are aching and my brain is weak. I think I'm standing on a stubborn street. Moment at dawn when the sky has lightened, minute before the first sun appears when all light begins.  True light, every color muted. Pieces of a music hidden in the mind by memory's collaboration with all other musics emerges now, emerges again anew in the middle of a dream, every song a new song, each now heard for the first time. Today I wake with a roaring thirst. We put the fab in fabric. All effects are special. You'll wake the birds. Two wakes, twin twenty five pound barbells resting on the rug implicit challenge. The roses have grown wild in the corner, rising high.  This compost is a small mountain, out of whose sides weeds arise, steam wisps over the lip of the cup, hot tea at the brink of a hot day. It's summertime, so that after an early evening movie the sun's still out, the day crowded with hours gathers at the horizon, an intricate dream in which I return to an old job site, peopled now by my current coworkers. Both move miraculously to a mining town in the Sierras. About ankle tiny sparrow chases huge vulture high over the freeway, zigzag path out by the way.  A walkway connects buildings over the street, which from twelve stories up, I look down upon. Old brick buildings of Larimer Square, all goo gawed up boutiques for tourists that stay open till nine at night. What is morning for? Form sets the reader's expectations, laying the ground for a happy or unhappy reading experience. A sentence late forgotten under the tree by the reservoir's edge. Bird in the dark this morning, my lip is blistered. Weight bends the sunflower, smell of fog. Imagination seizes power, but power buys imagination.  One bad habit is to leave underwear on the scale in the bathroom. Today a squirrel sits atop the sunflower pulling seeds out one by one. Fuchsias open, their pale pink outer petals turn up. That was a dream this is not. I'm not really traveling by submarine to a conference in Europe of paint stores. I'm trying to imagine what it will feel like when the surgeon cuts mine eye. Mockingbird imitates trio of crickets, then quiets once the sun rises. Standing, the blood rushes to my feet. Old familiar river. Notebooks, phones, forms. The day is warm.  Stain circles the shirt. In her private life, the old actress, now senile, was a surrealist. We pick our way through the cobwebbed residue of her home. Showers steam fogs my glasses. Lift the dead tree stump back into the back of the truck. Quickly the fireworks settle into a terrible sameness. The way a swarm of connotations settles in once you know the supposed to mean in the dream, where do I find it? Being a village explainer, I'm always happy to come upon a village. It's an old bus that travels between these small farm towns so far apart.  I disembark just to run into the store and fetch something to fix the zipper on the shoulder bag. But all my suitcases slow me down. And when I get back outside, it's long gone. Another not due for days. Often the dream dissolves instantly as I stumble for the alarm clock and light switch, leaving behind as a residue an emotional tone. I was being threatened, or there was a puzzle to solve, or I'd been abandoned by a bus. One difference with waking is that in dreams, I see clearly, sharply. I never wear a glasses. The one word I remember is Chadwick. It's not the details.  We're staring off into an amber horizon, trying to foretell the weather. Is a hurricane coming alongside three steamer trunks, each of which contains three bad guys unconscious, clad only in their skibbies. Then I wake up, a Roy Orbison song obsessively in my head, but the linkages between them offer no sensible verb. Suppress the impulse to name that tune. The two other people trapped in the elevator are a young man who's been in bed four days with the flu and an older woman who's a receptionist in a doctor's office somewhere in the building.  What spider could have spun a web so thick, so filmy, so strong? The first horizon of a sore throat, first burst of light that occurs over the kitchen over the bathroom sink is absorbed, refracted, swelling into the eye. Wind bends the brambles between the fence and the shed, a sound more like scraping than rustling as a train muscle hoots somewhere to the west. A solution thick as honey is poured into the eye, then the plastic cylinder inserted, standing upright in this base without actually touching the surface. A woman I haven't seen in fifteen years.  fifteen years, haven't thought of it in ten, a misshapen thing who wrought havoc in our political collective until we expelled her without, I believe, her even comprehending that that's what we've done returns in the dream as officious and anxious as ever. William Berry cheesecake right before bed enhances the effect.
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79	0.0	394.18	 five. Minor sentences can be divided into three primary and one secondary type according to clause structure. These are actually fairly important. five point one sequential sentences generated from compound ones. These sentences commonly begin with conjunctions such as and then went down to the chips. Marginal sentences generated from complex ones. In this two sentence paragraph from Plasma, the second sentence is of the marginal type. They blew the whole thing up and were presented with a fragment, an obvious mistake.  three elliptical sentences generated from simple ones, such as new mayor, no conflicts. And then non elliptical sentences with no clause structure, such as yes, no, or revolving door. There also exist four types of situations in tagmatic analysis, which also generate minor sentence types. Now the breakdown in the works I've read seems to me fairly arbitrary and in need of greater work. These are additions to statements, responses to questions, exclamations, and finally vocatives, greetings, calls, titles, and mottoes.  such as the Dodge Boys. The next question is how do sentences integrate the higher order units of meaning? The obvious first step here is toward the paragraph. And here I want to quote Valishinov one last time. In certain crucial respects, paragraphs are analogues to exchanges in dialogue. The paragraph is something like a vitiated dialogue worked in the body of a monologic utterance. Behind the device of partitioning speech into units, which are termed paragraphs in their written form, lie orientation toward listener or reader and calculation of the latter's possible reactions.  The weaker this orientation and calculation are, the less organized as regards paragraphs our speech will be. This classic these classic types of paragraphs are question and answer, where the question is posed and answer given by the same author, supplementation, anticipation of possible objections, the type cited in Willich and Warren, exposition of seeming discrepancies or illegicalities in one's own argument, and so forth. Very often we make our own speech or part of it the object of discussion. In such a case, a shift occurs in the speaker's attention from the reference of his speech to the speech itself.  reflection over one's own words. But even this shift in verbal intention is conditioned by the addressee's interest. If we could imagine speech that absolutely ignored the addressee, an impossible kind of speech, of course, we would have a case of speech with organic partition reduced to the minimum. Needless to say, we are not thinking here of certain special types of partition shaped by the particular aims and purposes of specific ideological fields, for instance, the strophic partition of speech and verse, or the purely logical partition of speech of the type premise conclusion, thesis, antithesis, and the like.  But we are, of course, thinking of exactly such things here. And I want to point out that the thing, the partitioning of paragraphs, the idea of a paragraph as a vitiated dialogue is something that is not radically different from the strategies you see in the work of David Brommage's essay poems, My Poetry and others. And David Anton, when he gave a talk over to Eddie Langdon Street, actually described his own work in exactly Evolutiono's terms as a vitiated dialogue. Rossi Landi, an Italian semiatician, focuses on that problem a little more closely. He suggests that the model of the above sentence.  Integration is classically the syllogism, such as in all women were once girls, and some women are lawyers, some lawyers are women. Logically, these lead to a third sentence or conclusion, a higher level of meaning, some lawyers were once girls. Literature precedes by the suppression most often of this third sentence, positing instead chains on the order of the first two. For example, here's plasma again. He thought they were a family unit. There were seven men and four women and thirteen children in the house. Which voice was he going to record? But this integration.  This assumption that all three of these statements are interrelated and, in fact, one would create higher orders of presumption about it is, in fact, just a presumption. In the next paragraph in Plasma, Watton plays with the reader's recognition of that presumptiveness. That's why we talk language. Back in Sephala, I'm writing this down, wallowing in a soft leather armchair. A dead dog lies in the gutter, his feet in the air. That third sentence has not much to do with the previous two. And the assumption that this is why we talk language is, again, the sort of thing that you can only integrate with the previous sentence.  By making that what I'm going to continue calling a syllogistic leap or a syllogistic movement above the level of the sentence. Two paragraphs before, the separation of the sentences in plasma is so large as to suppress the integration of sentences altogether. The burden of classes is the twentieth century career. He can be incredibly cruel. Events are advancing at a terrifying rate. Rossi Landi also gives us a final means of looking at the importance of the role of the sentence. In his work Linguistics and Economics, he argues a homology that language use arises from the need to divide the work in the community.  that the elaboration of language systems and labor production, up to and including all social production, are essentially identical. In this point of view, a completed tool is a sentence. A hammer, for example, consists of a face, a handle, and a cleaner claw. Without the presence of all three, hammers don't function. Sentences relate to their clauses in just the same way. Richard Stein disagreed with that. Only the manufacturer of hammers would have any use for disconnected handles.

But I stopped it there feeling the terms alien and culture extremely personal and felt the danger, the literal urge in fact to actually say something about micromanaged alienation and the experience of audience participation as portrayed in the soft porn novels of my own two tiered society. Nevertheless, this urge passed and was lost, was gone, was jettisoned, was judiciously diluted.  disearned and left out the lays of the intervenient chaos locked in on the smiling clenched dust revealed to me in that light thus spoke, or the sound of a footstep which unfolds which for it to be what it is for itself I give up and look up.

Sometimes Boober and me smoke pot. Other times, usually while banging, Boober has a twitch of sympathy.  But always for himself, and he calls the phone and it says anything, so he bangs on it too.

They themselves tended to live on islands, and thinking about what this meant had provoked them to think so much about this rising ocean level, and then to feel that the breaking off of the Antarctic Pine Island Glacier was all about them, or not all about them, but as having a scary relevance to their lives. King Rail. They often lived on an island in the Pacific, and they often lived on an island in the Atlantic.  These two residences of theirs as opposites, although both were places of great economic privilege and resources. Places that themselves consumed large amounts of resources and consumed more and more resources all the time. Lake Sturgeon. One preferred to think of itself as local and often in resistance to the United States. One preferred to think of itself as international and often as a center of finance and culture for the United States. Least bittern. One had a smallish city and one had one of the largest cities in the world. Least turn. One was six hundred square miles and one was twenty six square miles.  Both were likely to feel the effects of this rising ocean issue, although many of the residents of both were pretending that what was happening to the nations of Tuvalu, Kiribas, Marshall Islands, and Tokolau Islands did not really foretell of anything relevant to them at all. Leady's rose root. Often late at night to allay their worries, they tried to see climate change as just one more tendency of life towards change. Little Bluett. They tried to look forward to the new fjord that would be created by the receding Columbia glacier in Alaska, loggerhead sea turtle. They were fascinated by fjords, and there will soon be a new one to visit in ten years.  They would say to themselves, loggerhead shrike. Perhaps even new plants would evolve there, long eared sunfish. Or they tried to be comforted about how they grew up in a town that was located right at the edge of where the Wisconsin Glacier had ended its journey, longhead darter. And because it had ended there, the soil in this area was especially rich as the glacier pushed topsoil before it as it moved, then dumped it right where the town was now, long tailed salamander. For years, they had eaten off the wealth of the glacier as their family had lived in the hilly section of town and had grown a vegetable garden in the backyard and the rich topsoil.  Or they like to think about the scientist who claimed that in terms of patterns of heating and cooling on the Earth's surface, the Earth should be entering a new ice age, Masasaga. It is long overdue, he claimed, Moon Eye. Yet, according to him, this ice age has been perhaps counteracted by human climatic interference, Masi Valvata. So maybe we were better off, maybe better fire than ice, although who knew what gods or demons were being angered and what they would do with their anger, mottled Duskywing. They were not scientists and could not figure out what to blame or what the long term consequences might be.  They might not be able to figure this out. Mountain Brook Lamprey. They made no claim to answers. They just noticed things, mud sunfish. And the more they read, the more confused they became mud turtle. And at this moment in their lives, there was more to read than ever before, and it was easier than ever before to require it as it came through their computers. And all the time, the computers had newer and better search engines, making more and more specific information easier to find. New England Cottontail. They knew there were certain enemies in this story, such as Bush with his refusal to sign the Kyoto Accord and certain industries. Northeastern beach tiger beetle.  Also knew that the Kyoto Accord was too little, too late, northern cricket frog. They also knew that they didn't want to let excessive information paralyze them, northern ghost hawk or excessive guilt, northern harrier. So they felt that they had to say that they and they felt that they had to say that they knew that they were in part responsible for it, whatever it was that was causing this, because they lived in the place that used the largest amount of stuff most likely to cause this warming, northern wild monkshood. They lived among those who used the most stuff up, who burned the most stuff, who produced the most stuff, and other things like that, Olympia, marble. And even if they tried to live their lives with less stuff than others.  They still benefited and were a part of the system that produced all the stuff. And because of this, they had a hard time figuring out how to move beyond their own personal renewed commitment to denial of stuff. And yet their awareness of how they benefited daily from being a part of the system that used up the most stuff.

Heat ripples up from the noon street and from rusted car tops. The salt in the air stings my eyes. I lift a latch, step into a patio, bird of paradise in bloom. But approaching the window, I find peeled paint, cobwebs. It's dingy inside. I turn, wade into sleep. Do as you're told scumsuckers.  You're the reason there are hydrogen bombs yelled at the postal worker behind the counter. It leopards the body. Cringes at strangled ant eaters and raccoons hanging in the market.

Cars clunk as they drive off the ferry at Chinokele. You walk up the steps.  and find a double peristyle with a deep entrance porch filled with columns. At the base of the columns is an octagonal set of carved dragons, mermaids, and palmettes. You turn, stride down a dark and narrow vaulted ramp that emerges with blinding light into a large hall open to the sky. A continuous frieze on three walls has a central acanthus flanked by griffins and lyres. At the far end, roped off by string, is the foundation of an inner temple with steps that drop to a wall.  When you walk toward the sanctum and look back, you see stairs to the platform of Epiphanes at the rear. You gaze up to the top of a sixty five foot column, step up to the cord, but can't get near enough to see if the spring is dry or wet. You hunger for insight into the precarious nature of becoming. Gaze at the woman you love, whet at how passion is water from a spring. Realize that yesterday, exhausted, you are not going to come this far.  Day having come, you have sunlight in your hands. Because one stirred the entrails of a goat immolated on an altar. Because a magpie flicks tail feathers. Because blood rushed tulips bloomed on the walkway. Because one speaks without fear of reprisal. Because a man crushed in the debris of aluminum doors, steering wheel, dashboard, shivered windshield bleeds and moans. Because he had to visualize black petunias in order to spot black trumpets.  Because he slowly bites the back of her neck. Because an eagle glides over the courtyard with outstretched wings. Because a woman fasted, chewed laurel leaves, swayed in noon heat, stammered, the here is always beginning. Because she brushes her hair across his eyelids. Because bells tinkle around the necks of goats. Because the ruins of this moment are chalk white dust in your hands. Because a grain of sand lodged.  Because loss is a seed that germinates into all things are full of gods. Because a circle opens in all directions. Nine purple irises bloom in a triangular glass vase. A pearl forms in an oyster. She folds a prayer and ties it to a green cryptomeria branch. Threaded sponges are hanging in the doorway. A slug crawls along a railroad tie.  Upstairs suffused the house with longing. Silk tree leaflets fold up when touched. Waking out of her coma, she vowed, I will dip my hands in ink and drag them across white mulberry paper. A hummingbird sipping at a columbine darted off.

Torres-Edwin_Complete-Recording_Interview_Copp-Street_San-Francisco_9-7-90	0.0	434.83	 So I'm going to have these luscious sibachromes of almost abstract images because there'll be really dramatic blowups of only fractions of photographs in the magazines. But you could you'll be able to see like the glass rim of the vice president, just the corner of the glasses of the vice president, for instance, Alfonso Guerra, who is like Cardinal Richelieu. He's like a power in the shadow.  Or the sideburn of the prime minister, you know, that was very funny because when he was elected, he was still fairly young. He was in his early forties. And then overnight, his sideburns went white because, you know, there's a little sense of respectability and, you know, like patina of experience or whatever, you know, so that may be another one. Then you may see in another picture the earring of Franco's granddaughter, you know, who's married to a French antique dealer. Or the smile.  It sounds like a Gioconda smile of Isabel Presler, who is a notorious, a glorified courtesan that has been married first to a pop singer, Julio Iglesias, who was her first husband, then she married a count, and then she married Boyer, who at the time was like a superminister, he was the Minister of Economics and Finances, and probably the most powerful minister in Spain at the time, but the socialist government.  maneuvers herself into associating herself with, you know, the most powerful men at the moment. And so there's this The smile, because she has this really like the Gioconda smile, you know, she looks like a porcelain doll, she comes from a Philippine family, you know, from that time when the Philippines were a Spanish dominion and all that. And he's very cold and very elegant and but at the same time it's just pure slack, you know. Because that's another thing that has happened in Spain is that the politics and and commerce.  culture and the tabloid culture has all become completely mixed, indiscriminately mixed. But it's even more there. It's really amazing. I mean, you would buy a magazine that would be the equivalent of Time magazine or Newsweek, and it's just appalling, because at least these magazines, American magazines, that they may be biased, and you can read very clearly between the lines, where their ideology is and everything. But they still talk about serious issues, at least the main features, whatever happens in Newsweek.  You know, there's one international part that they may, you know, talk about, whatever. And then the national, you know, affairs and so on. But it never gets as low as what the Spanish magazines are doing right now. And they claim that they have to do that because otherwise people don't buy them. But, I mean, it's like they go to the point of telling you who's sleeping with what? With whom? You know, in the cover. I mean, you know, whose mistress is, you know, a science cell and it's just amazing, you know. I have like the national enquirer across Oh, yes. But the point is that, you know, it's not the national enquirer.  It's supposed to be Newsweek. And that's one part of the other part of it is the socialist government in an attempt to associate themselves with the most progressive and stylish and visible structures of society. They like to hang out with artists and singers and pop singers. So again, that also has helped that sort of not having a clear boundary where the party ends and the real serious business beginner after the Great Divine.  I mean, his whole thesis is that that's the signal of that's postmodernism. I mean, modernism was this division between high and low, and postmodernism was a lot of disintegration for that. I should I want to have you talk about what's going to happen in Cambridge. It's okay, honestly. I could always have it. And what I mean, the nineteen eighty nine Whitney biennial.  Controversy. Were you surprised by the controversy completely? I mean, I was blind that you didn't. Yeah. I was getting ready to fight a good one in Indianapolis. Because I thought that that was going to really do make a big stink. And nothing happened. It didn't happen. And the backyard, totally unexpectedly, then the thing just blew up in my face. And it was a total surprise in New York. Something like this was.  Do you, and I mean, as I said before, I thought that there were, had there been any long term effects from, I mean, I don't know what they would be. As usual in those kind of situations, you got a lot of actual free publicity, but more people found out about the beast than women found out about if that would happen. It's a double edged thing, because at one point I had to actually, you know, tell the reporters when they called.  That if they were only interested in the, you know, all the big scandal and everything, the fact that, you know, the two museums, actually three museums were, you know, involved in the whole thing. And they only wanted there to lean in, there wasn't interested, you know, that they were only going to get my, my side of the, of the story if they were going to, to talk about the piece, what the content was and, and to read the work, you know, the other thing is, I mean, you know, another kind of appropriation, every time you saw the image in these articles about the controversy, there was never the whole image. No, they didn't never include the screen.
Towle-Tony_Complete-Reading_Blue-Mountain-Gallery_NYC_2-8-86	0.0	495.97	 Well, I read the fort. Brief moments with Tchaikovsky. You are in for a rare treat. Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky is in a playful mood. Over here, he declares, pointing to the croissant, sitting atop what appears to be a raisin, is the extraordinary Pere Lachaise cemetery, with the magnificent Marc Antoine Charpentier far beneath its crust. You will have to imagine the sounds of the Baroque Concertino yourself, if you want to.  No, I think in my best moments I am worthy to nourish the same patch of ground. Or vice versa, he adds with a wink, biting off an end of the croissant, and leaving Charpentier exposed to the close air of the parlor. Any particular baroque composer, I inquire, whose Concertino I am supposed to be imagining? I didn't say the composer had to be baroque, Peter counters airily, only the work. What about Porcini? I had to confess I was stumped. The only composer I knew by that name was a local and rather inept butcher who somewhat resembled the results of his trade. My host, who by this time had finished off both the Pere Lachaise cemetery and the remains of Porcini.  Charpentier was looking particularly sly. What instruments are used in this Concertino by Porcini that you have in mind? I asked carefully. But I could see that I had waited too long, that Tchaikowski had entered the tunnel of self absorption and was already far out of earshot. I will enter the salon of the immortals so, he continued to himself, flinging open the closet with an elegantly melancholy flourish. Staring at the not overly expansive view, he mumbled aloud, I would never have tried to support myself by playing the piano while simultaneously reading a book in a Hamburg Bordello, like my cunningly controversial colleague once did. It was Brahms, if you want to know.  And I know what women are like, too. They're different and I don't understand them. He pointed indecisively at the further wall. See that promontory over there? A beautiful siren used to sit and comb her tasteless mass of tresses. Once I approached and the smell was absolutely horrible, but alas, I will never see her splendid face again. These are earlier, obviously.  Geological time particularly. Historical time. And the allegorical figure of Brooklyn. The allegorical figure of Brooklyn is right here, there, where you're standing. And here's how it works. The lamps go on and we walk through miles of parks. The rain and the sleet are brought on. We travel to Queens for two weeks of vacation. The sun returns, and the grass and farms, the villages of Brooklyn, continue to grow. And the spacious terrace and oily sand of Brooklyn breathe, brought slowly by the figure. And back toward home on the BMT, we smile at the tender.  figure and wave goodbye. North. The direction, not the poet. I didn't know him at the time. The green figures move forward and the objects grow larger. Explorers of the sky, exploring the earth immersed in water. nineteen sixty seven with its fatal look of artificial brevity. Your life as if an illusion putting you near the window and promptly all the winds and currents ruffle the curtains.  Surroundings, a transparent lizard under the leaves and stretching its rubber like plastic across the room, protruding with our European selves, show that we valiantly dig at the earth, poise on the brink of adventure, or blister the flatulent sky. In other words, you are held amused peacefully in the grass, O beautiful arts springing to mind as we are the supreme judges. Or perhaps you have forgotten an important, exaggerated phrase, and your words spread over the stones in a pure grove of the specific, and you speak only the names of the bellowing animals, plants and trees which blind you touch, ships, insects peopling the forest.  etcetera. The labyrinth speaks from its precipice, its outline shoots in a curve through the chemical air, in addition to writing the script. O miracles of divine reaches and words spinning from infancy, and whose business and indispensable references are not known, your story is truly a story to treasure, distilled and toxicant that it is, saying that I am a synonym for the relaxed and drifting universe, a mere summary holding my attention over the thundering firmament.  april twenty fourth. Each year our group holds a ceremony at the grave of some great poet, singing and paying tribute to his memory, to some great poems he has left to be read and remembered. Last spring, Edwin Denby, Kenneth Coke, John Ashbury, Jimmy Schuyler, Kenrad Elmsley, Frank Lima, Bill Burksen, Joe Travolo, Ted Berrigan, Alan Kaplan, Ron Paget, Dick Gallup, Larry Fagin, Peter Sheldall, Joe Brainer, John Jorno, Ann Waldman, Michael Brownstein, Louis Worsh, David Shapiro, and I chartered a bus and went to visit the Hard Crane.  Monument in Cleveland. We returned on april twenty fourth, refreshed, amused, and ready to write. The budding plants and flowers, after their endless absence during the harsh winter, gave us all the feeling of being in love for the first time. That is, after the harsh winter of white snow and cold wandering visions, as the windows rattled in the wind, when the floors creaked in the midst of our pondering memories and complaints, and from when the pitch of a snowy night, the furious wolf, dripping blood from the gaping jar of his mouth, pacing the shells and flames, reminded us of the terrible days of Hart Crane, when people were not as kind.  to poets as they are today. Notes on Velasquez for Irving and Lucy Sandler. My career has been spent as a courtier and as a familiar of the court and the king. I am Velasquez. It is difficult to explain myself.

Wisher-Yolanda_Complete-Recording_8-4-16	0.0	455.72	 Cross Ludlow, past the mailbox on the corner. Risque video, Dino's pizza, and the emerald laundry mat. The fruit trucks tucked into forty fourth Street on the left. House eyes shut with boards, fringes of children. Once we went into a store sunk into the street, owned by a Cambodian woman. She sold everything, from evening gowns to soup. Over to Walnut and forty fifth, where the Muslim cat sells this chicken wrapped in pita, draped in cucumber sauce. The pregnant woman behind the counter writes our order out in Arabic. We grab a juice from the freezer.  Some chips. I, the bean and sweet potato pies. Back into the hot breath of West Philly, sun is setting. The sky is smeared squash, tangerines in a glaze. Three girls and one boy jump double dutch. A white man hustles from the video store with a black plastic bag. We look for money in the street, steal flowers from the church lawn. The shit stain from the wino is still on our step. mister Jim is washing a car for cash. John is cleaning his rims to boujou bontan. Noel is talking sweetly to the big blue eyed woman. Linda on her way to the restaurant.  The sister in the wheelchair buzzes by with her headphones on. One night a man was shot and killed on this block, right outside our thick wood door, but not today. Today is one of those days to come home from walking in the world, leave the windows open, start a pot of black beans, smoke some Alice Coltrane, cut up some fruit, toenails, hold on to the moment, as if time is taking your blood pressure.  I have this feeling that my heart will break from the knowing of you. So every day I will hold myself to the fire of love and sing you the lullabies of my dreams. And even as I hold you, I will divine and fashion my heart for the letting go, imagining space without your scent, your newness. I will send the ashes of all the ghosts who threaten our feast to the winds that run counter.  This feeling that the deepest cracks in my heart will be cemented with joy. First poem at forty. Today I am forty. The years have added up. Virginia's slim sayings pepper the air. I wear my womanhood like a shirling on the subway. Royal minx in the bathroom of suburban station. I am here. I am still here. I have not been broken beyond repair. I am purple onion.  Red lemon, lead paint on the window sill, the web between toes. I want to write bishop poems about fish for the next forty years, and who will stop me? Who will stand in my way? Certainly not the ghost who visit in my sleep, certainly not some half formed girl of my nightmares, only me. I am the grind and the force, I am the turning wheel, the luminous walk of water along the river of a curb. I am Yavanda's daughter, and better and cold for it. The grandfather clocks are chanting songs about my secondhandedness.  My two headedness, my third womb, no gurus to pull out my teeth, no kites to hang my woes upon, I am the fray in the string before it splits, I am the break in my own heart, this is forty, this is forty, my love, you dear, gone baby girl, gone woman child, gone the old ladies who'd with me laugh about my lazy loins, Miss Y'all. THE PERFORMER.  You go fishing for strangers. You want to write something full of alchemy that'll make people sit up in their chakras and go, Make somebody remember you for ages when you leave the room. Not fight your way through the crowd but mingle and descend like tar residue from the ceiling. You want to leave a trace of yourself on the cotton of people. You want the band to know your name, the mic to know your mist, the poem to pull your strings and make you dance. Can you make a match strike behind their eyes? Can you make the walls wail?  Ailing from their beds, like a brother all in white, like a big woman spitting up rats and wash boards on the bandstand, bosom heaving with a bull weevil's song, you bring the belt that lashes the back of everyone's soul, and when you finish, everybody feel weary, everybody go home, think about love, or make it. My grandmamma's house is the EPA.  Call this place home, and there's hella pay. Shady lane banks still peep, or scribs away, Police departments acting like the KKK. Turn coach treat my prayers like a runaway. We rock the mask and hoodie like a gambo ray. But can't be no union when our black asses ain't okay. Shall we wait for the whiz to change the color of the day, While witches of doom rain on our hey hey hey? I'm just the black girl sipping ninety four due belay, Plotting over a mean double crochet, How to make my grandma's house the USA. Gonna wear my love like combat boots and berets. See them doctors.  This can't save you but your grandma may. See them doc, this can't save you but your grandma may. See them doc, this can't save you. Dido Mandingo grew up in the Bay of Montego. Child of martyrs said he'd rather be my hero. Reinvent me in the coves of Montenegro. Bilingual, he altered the way of my lingo. His tongue had a style so insistent.

I want to be another stumble of flesh glimpsed from a crack in the arcade's newgate facade. Can you see me without remembering my trimmed voice boiling in the cauldrons of rural drive ins, old cars quivering to a fresh line of mattresses ticking in the calcified vortex of ginghams faded dark, scuffed knee scuffed kneecap hand clamp refusals, derelict promises, unbuttoned scratches and sprawled whimpers, parish fandangos perishing before mainspring pouradahs?  A dented hubcap, a hoisted scalp, a tuxedo towel wheeled through a sieve of hoops, this laminated stem, that molasses skeleton, pummeled slot poured into a briefcase jug, lacquered lacquey with a slight tin verb, you know them all by their fame, their loss of glass proximity, these are the citizens whose matching hands are preserved in the corruptions of pearl cement, lost gallopers strapped to a bicycle of dimes. I was fresh from the ancient sewers of Berlin, when I joined the army of fish flopping toward the western citadel of cooling shores.  Lost ghouls we chimed, you are the Ohio overture of our fatal dreams. Inside your propane studio, its slate straps and northern light, a ravaged acne mop licks the vomit off your claws. I squeeze the ointment out of coy poodles, you muddle across the pores and boots of oil soak. A clock erases sod details rusting in the roars of our stiff rising. Phonograph daylight warps any chance for us to strike a splashy tune. Autograph clowns adjust their portable noses, hammer down their electric ties, raise the shades of their puttied hems.  The mold of a famished spire burns in me still, its tarred finger pointing toward the owl eye night. I want to scrape down these trays of crab slivers and molten crumbs, leave the ants to the rocks where they dance and prey. Can you lend me the shaping iron of your frayed stump? Or offer me a slab of cold soliloquy in paint's blackened tongue? Not ham on immaculate dread. I've licked that stout before. Will I ever become the residue of your mature simplicity? I want the sludge to harden into a circular map of my inside skin, the one whose face of  Inconsistencies, never debuts, debuts on the silver screen.

The one who says, I did not cross the line you drew in the air. I did not stoop to steal the air you buried in the air.  Had you known it was yours, you might have used it. Had I known it was mine, I might have saved it. Someone speaking into a tape recorder. Someone with a name that sounds like yours. Someone who claims she, or perhaps he, dreamed that they, there must have been two of them, were you, that they had your hair and hands, saw through your eyes, and did the things they did to someone else, someone with the names you wanted for your own. The voice that said, This is my story. This is the only one, and the ones who are in it will never leave the rooms I have erected around their hair.

The one who announces, You will not lift my dress over my head. You will not wear my shirt and shoes. You will not point that camera at me. You will not see me with someone else doing something that has no name. The one who answers back, When will you take off these buttons and swallow them like pills? When will you fill the room with shoelaces of seaweed and salt? And this is angel atropato twenty four. It was early October, a time of gathering insect husks floating on the pools of seaweed.  sleep. We were in an adjacent room, licking the last of summer's slime from our fur, a basket of roses wedged between our teeth. You were going to be the sweetened gum of something more one day. Once you could, a whiff of a chance, but now never is always.
