BUT MOST OF ALL SHE LOVED THE PARTICLES THAT TRANSFORM OBJECTS OF THE SAME CATEGORY INTO PARTICULAR ONES EACH DISTINCT WITHIN AND APART FROM ITS OWN CLASS IN ALL THIS SPRINGING UP WAS NO HINT OF A TIDE ONLY A PLEASANT WAVERING OF THE AIR IN WHICH ALL THINGS SEEM PRESENT WHETHER JUST PAST OR SOON TO COME IT WAS ALL INVITATION SO MUCH THE FLOWERS OUTLINED ALONG THE NIGHT ALLEYS WHEN FEW WERE VISIBLE YET THEIR STORY SOUNDED LOUDER THAN THE HUM OF BUG AND STICK NOISES THAT BROUGHT UP THE REAR TRUNDLING IT ALONG INTO A NEW FACT OF DAY THESE WERE MEANT TO BE READ AS ANY SALUTATION BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS BUT THEY STUCK TO THEIR GUNS AND SO MUCH WAS THEIR OBSTINACY IN KEEPING WITH THE REST LIKE LONG FLASHES OF WHITE BIRDS THAT REFUSED TO DIE WHEN DAY DOES THAT NONE KNEW THE WARP WHICH PRESENTED THIS MAJOR MOVEMENT AS A FIRM DIGRESSION A PLAIN THAT SLOWLY BECOMES A MOUNTAIN SO EACH FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT IN A NET AS A FASHION AND ALL EFFORTS TO WRIGGLE FREE INVOLVED HIM FURTHER INEXORABLY SINCE ALL EXISTED THERE TO BE TOLD SHOT THROUGH FROM BORDER TO BORDER HERE WERE STONES THAT READ AS PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THERE WAS THE STORY OF THE GRANDPARENTS OF THE VIGOROUS YOUNG CHAMPION THE LINES ONCE GIVEN TO ANOTHER NOW RESTORED TO THE NEW SPEAKER DINNERS AND ASSEMBLIES THE LIGHT IN THE OLD HOME THE SECRET WAYS THE ROOMS FED INTO EACH OTHER BUT ALL WAS WARINESS OF TIME WATCHING ITSELF FOR NOTHING IN THE COMPLEX STORY GREW OUTSIDE THE GREATNESS IN THE MOMENT OF TELLING STAYED UNRESOLVED UNTIL ITS WEALTH OF INCIDENT PAIN MIXED WITH PLEASURE FADED IN THE PRECISE MOMENT OF BURSTING INTO BLOOM ITS GROWTH A STATIC LAMENT SOME STORIES SURVIVE THE DYNASTY OF THE BUILDERS BUT THEIR ECHO WAS ITSELF LOCKED IN BECAME ANTICIPATION THAT WAS ONLY MEMORY AFTER ALL FOR THE POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITED IT IS SEEN AT THE END THAT THE KIND AND GOOD ARE REWARDED THAT THE UNJUST ONE IS DOOMED TO BURN FOREVER AROUND HIS ERROR SADDER AND WISER ANYWAY BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES THE OTHERS MUDDLE THROUGH LIKE {us / u. s.} UNCERTAIN BUT WEARING ARTLESSLY THEIR FUNCTION OF MINOR CHARACTERS WHO MUST BE KEPT IN MIND IT IS WE WHO MAKE THIS JUNGLE AND CALL IT SPACE NAMING EACH ROUTE

RESTORED TO GOOD HUMOR AS IT ISSUES INTO THE IMPERVIOUS EVENING AIR SO IN SOME WAY ALTHOUGH THE ARITHMETIC IS INCORRECT THE BALANCE IS RESTORED BECAUSE IT BALANCES KNOWING IT PREVAILS AND THE MAN WHO

AND AND BEGAN TEACHING POETRY TO STUDENTS AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE AND FOUND MYSELF IMMEDIATELY ASSAILED BY THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS POETRY AND WHY IS THIS A POEM AND WHY DO YOU SAY THIS is not AND WHAT IS POETRY ANYWAY AND SO THIS CALLED WHAT IS POETRY BUT THE TITLE HAS NO QUESTION MARK AND I do not THINK IT WAS PROBABLY VERY HELPFUL TO THE STUDENTS BUT IT WAS PART OF MY FINALLY BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS POETRY MYSELF HAVING DONE IT FOR A LONG TIME with out EVER HAVING ASKED MYSELF THAT QUESTION AND IT ENDS AS SO MANY OF MY POEMS DO OR OR RATHER THEY INCLUDE LINES OF B BITS OF CONVERSATION OVERHEARD VERY OFTEN WHEN WALKING DOWN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK WHERE YOU HEAR RATHER PECULIAR THINGS some timeS WHAT IS POETRY THE MEDIEVAL TOWN WITH FRIEZE OF BOY SCOUTS FROM NAGOYA THE SNOW THAT CAME WHEN WE WANTED IT TO SNOW BEAUTIFUL IMAGES TRYING TO AVOID IDEAS AS IN THIS POEM BUT WE GO BACK TO THEM AS TO A WIFE LEAVING THE MISTRESS WE DESIRE NOW THEY WILL HAVE TO BELIEVE IT AS

BOOKSHOP IN NEW YORK AND DECIDED TO KEEP IT THE NEXT ONE AT NORTH FARM WAS WRITTEN IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES AND ALTHOUGH NORTH FARM OBVIOUSLY COULD BE ANYWHERE AND I do not EXPLAIN IN THE POEM WHA WHAT SUGGESTED IT IT WAS {it's / it is / it has} ACTUALLY THE NAME GIVEN IN A TRANSLATION I READ OF THE KALEVALA THE FINNISH FOLK EPIC OF PLACED CALLED I THINK IT POHJOLA I do not KNOW HOW THE FINNISH PRONUNCIATION PLACE DESCRIBED AS BEING NEAR HELL BUT NOT EXACTLY IN IT AND ALWAYS WITH THE EPITHET LOOMING AND PROSPEROUS NORTH FARM AT NORTH FARM SOMEWHERE SOMEONE IS TRAVELING FURIOUSLY TOWARD YOU

ENOUGH THAT THE DISH OF MILK IS SET OUT AT NIGHT THAT WE THINK OF HIM some timeS some timeS AND ALWAYS WITH MIXED FEELINGS WELL THIS IS A FAIRLY RECENT POEM OF THE PAST FEW YEARS do not KNOW EXACTLY WHEN CALLED AT FIRST I THOUGHT I would not SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND I {can not / cannot} THINK OF ANYTHING I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WROTE IT SO I will not INTRODUCE IT EXCEPT I SEE IT HAS THE PHRASE THE UNRULY SUN OBVIOUSLY A THEFT FROM JOHN DUNNE AT FIRST I THOUGHT I would not SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT THEN I THOUGHT KEEPING QUIET ABOUT IT MIGHT APPEAR EVEN RUDER AT FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN BUT THAT SCAPEGRACE THE UNRULY SON INFORMED ME OTHERWISE i am IN MY HEAVYSET PANTS AND FIND THIS OCCUPATION OF BEEKEEPER CHARMING THOUGHT I HAVE YET TO MEET MY FIRST BEE WE do not KNOW IF I GET TO KEEP THE HAT AND VEIL TOO HOT HE SAID TOO HOT FOR EVERYTHING HE SO CARING SO MUNDANE TO HAVE YOU on board BULGARIAN CHOIRS EVERYWHERE STOOD UP AND SANG THE SONG OF THE RENT IT WAS LOVELY NOW I SHALL TAKE A SHORT VACATION PROOF THAT I AM NEEDED HERE NOBODY WANTS MY TWO CENTS any more I BELIEVE TO SOME IT WAS LIKE SKATING IN SUMMER A SMALL TURRET PERCHED OVER THE LAKE IT EXPLODED {that's / that is / that has} THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT PEOPLE TAKING ME OUT TO SOME NICE REPAST AND AFTERWARDS YOU GO HOME AND GO OVER EVERYTHING THAT WAS STATED I PREFER FLOWERS AND BREATHING THE NEXT POEM IS CALLED NO LONGER VERY CLEAR AND WELL {it's / it is / it has} NO LONGER VERY CLEAR TO ME WHEN I WROTE IT OR WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WROTE IT how ever I I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE PUBLIC RADIO STATION IN IN NEW YORK CITY WNYC HAD A BENEFIT CONCERT AND THEY ASKED ME TO CONTRIBUTE A POEM WHICH WOULD BE SET TO MUSIC BY A NUMBER OF CONTEMPORARY COMPOSERS OR AT ANY RATE THEY WOULD WRITE MUSIC SUGGESTED BY IT IF THEY were not ACTUALLY SETTING THE WORDS AND PHILIP GLASS MORTON GOULD TANIA LEON WERE AMONG THE COMPOSERS AND ONE OF THEM WAS THE COMPOSER JOAN TOWER WHO IS ACTUALLY A A FRIEND OF MINE AND AND COLLEAGUE AT BARD COLLEGE WHERE SHE TEACHES AND SHE TOOK TWO OF THE LINES AND WROTE PIANO PIECES THAT SHE SAYS ARE BASED ON AND THEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOING TO DO ANOTHER ONE TO MAKE THREE BUT SHE has not DONE IT YET
Ashbery-John_Complete-Recording_Attitudes-Towards-the-Flame_Territory-of-Art_MOCA_LA_83 A a 0.049 384.17 IT did not TOOK MUCH LONGER THAN ANY OTHER POETRY THAT i have EVER WRITTEN IT WAS THE THREE POEMS WERE WRITTEN OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF MAYBE I did not QUITE KNOW WHAT I WANTED TO DO I I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO WRITE POETIC PROSE THAT was not POETIC IN OTHER WORDS A P A A A PROSE POEM THAT REALLY DREW ON THE RESOURCES OF PROSINESS AS WELL AS POETIC SOUNDING LANGUAGE AND AND INDEED I TRIED TO GET AS MANY DIFFERENT TONES OF WRITING AND VOICE AS POSSIBLE I SO I GUESS I FAIRLY EARLY ON IMAGINED THIS WORK AS BEING KIND OF THREE LARGE OBLONG BOXES THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO FILL WITH SOMETHING AND I did not REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A AND {that's / that is / that has} FREQUENTLY THE CASE WHEN I WHEN I BEGIN WRITING I CAN SORT OF SEE THE SHAPE OF THE POEM BUT {it's / it is / it has} JUST AN EMPTY OUTLINE AND AND NO IDEA WHAT i am X GOING TO STOP GOING TO END UP THIS IS A PASSAGE FROM THE SYSTEM FROM IN ONE OF THE THREE POEMS IN THE BOOK THREE POEMS I KNOW NOW THAT i am NOT LONGER WAITING AND THAT THE PREVIOUS PART OF MY LIFE IN WHICH I THOUGHT I WAS WAITING AND THEREFORE ONLY HALF ALIVE WAS NOT WAITING ALTHOUGH IT WAS TINGED WITH EXPECTANCY BUT LIVING UNDER AND INTO THIS REPLY WHICH HAS SUDDENLY CAUSED EVERYTHING IN MY WORLD TO TAKE ON NEW MEANING IT IS AS THOUGH I HAD PICKED UP THE THREAD WHICH I HAD MERELY MISLAID AND WHICH FOR A LONG TIME SEEMED LOST AND ALL BECAUSE I AM CERTAIN NOW ALBEIT FOR NO VERY GOOD REASON THAT IT WAS THIS ONE AND NO OTHER THE SADNESS THAT INFECTED {us / u. s.} AS CHILDREN AND STAYED ON THROUGH ADULTHOOD HAS HEALED AND THERE CAN BE NO OTHER WAY EXCEPT THIS WAY OF HEALTH WE ARE TAKING SILENT AS IT IS BUT IT LETS {us / u. s.} LOOK BACK ON THOSE OTHER SEEMINGLY SPOILED DAYS AND REEVALUATE THEM ACTUALLY THEY WERE TOO WELL ROUNDED EACH BORE ITS SHARE OF HAPPINESS AND GRIEF AND FINISHED ITS TALE JUST AS TWILIGHT WAS DESCENDING THOSE DAYS ARE NOW AN INSEPARABLE PART OF OUR STORY DESPITE THEIR AIR OF IMMATURITY AND TENTATIVENESS THEY HAVE THE FRESHNESS OF EARLY WORKS WHICH MAY BE WRONGLY DISCARDED LATER NOR IS TODAY REALLY ANY DIFFERENT WE ARE AS CHILDISH AS EVER IT TURNS OUT ONLY PERHAPS A LITTLE BETTER AT DISGUISING IT BUT WE STILL WANT WHAT WE WANT WHEN WE WANT IT AND NO POWER ON EARTH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DENY IT TO {us / u. s.} BUT AT LEAST WE SEE NOW THAT THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE AND SO WE HAVE THE SENSE TO STOP INSISTING EVERY SO OFTEN UNDER THE GUISE OF SOME APPARENTLY UNRELATED ACTIVITY BECAUSE WE THINK WE SHALL BE BETTER SATISFIED THIS WAY UNDERNEATH THE DISCREET BEHAVIOR THE DESIRE IS AS IMPERIOUS AS EVER BUT AFTER SO MANY POSTPONEMENTS WE NOW realise THAT A LITTLE DELAY will not HURT AND WE CAN RELAX IN THE ASSURANCE OF EVENTUAL SATISFACTION THIS WAS THE MESSAGE OF THAT DAY IN THE STREET WHEN YOU FIRST PERCEIVED THAT CONVENTIONAL HAPPINESS WOULD NOT DO FOR YOU AND DECIDED TO OPT FOR THE ERRATIC KIND DESPITE THE DANGERS THAT ITS NEED FOR CONTINUAL GROWTH AND EXPANSION EXPOSED IT TO THIS STARTED YOU ON YOUR WAY ALTHOUGH IT OFTEN SEEMED AS THOUGH YOUR FEET HAD STRUCK ROOTS INTO THE GROUND AND YOU WERE DOOMED TO GROW AND DECAY LIKE A TREE NEVERTHELESS YOU WERE AWARE OF MOVING WHETHER IT WAS YOU WHO WERE MOVING OR THE LANDSCAPE MOVING FORWARD TOWARD YOU AND YOU COULD REMAIN PATIENT WITH THE IDEA OF GROWTH AS LONG AS THE CONCEPT OF UNIQUENESS THAT ONE AND NO OTHER HAD SHOWN LIKE A STAR IN THE SKY ABOVE YOU JOHN ASHBERY READING A PASSAGE FROM THE SYSTEM FROM HIS BOOK THREE POEMS FOR THE READER OF ASHBERY'S WORK ONE INITIAL OBSTACLE IS OVERCOMING THE EXPECTATION OF A LITERAL SEQUENTIAL UNDERSTANDING WELL IT SEEMS THAT I I THINK PEOPLE BRING THIS EXPECTATION TO ALMOST ANY POETRY AND ARE DESTINED TO BE DISAPPOINTED SINCE I do not THINK THIS CONDITION IS UNIQUE TO ME BY ANY CHANCE BUT APPLIES TO ALMOST ANY POETRY THAT I CAN THINK OF {it's / it is / it has} IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A COMPLETELY EXPOSITORY POEM IN MIND AND THEN SIT DOWN AND WRITE IT AND IT WOULD BE EXACTLY AS IT WAS CONCEIVED ALL KINDS OF STRANGE THINGS HAPPEN WHILE ONE IS WRITING WHICH DEFLECT THE ORIGINAL INTENT AND MY OWN WORK I GUESS IS JUST A AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF LETTING THIS HAPPEN TO ME IT SEEMS MORE TRUTHFUL SINCE {it's / it is / it has} A MORE COMPLETE R REFLECTION OF OF OF MY THOUGHT WHILE i am WRITING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMPOSER ELLIOTT CARTER WROTE AN UNUSUAL WORK TITLED SYRINGA FOR MEZZO SOPRANO BASS AND CHAMBER ENSEMBLE THE BASS SINGS A COLLECTION OF GREEK TEXTS ON THE LEGEND OF ORPHEUS WHILE THE MEZZO SOPRANO SIMULTANEOUSLY SINGS JOHN ASHBERY'S POEM CALLED SYRINGA MYTH OF ORPHEUS IS THAT OF THE LEGENDARY SINGER WHO BRINGS HIS BELOVED EURYDICE BACK FROM DEATH AN ALLEGORY ABOUT THE PRESUMED POWER OF MUSIC AN POETRY TO TURN TIME BACK AND STOP IRRETRIEVABLE LOSS EVEN BEFORE SYRINGA ASHBERY HAD LONG ADMIRED CARTER WHAT IS IT ABOUT {carter's / carter is / carter has} MUSIC THAT THE POET FINDS SO SYMPATHETIC TO HIS WORK WELL THE FACT I GUESS THAT {it's / it is / it has} SO COMPLEX AND YET SO CLEAR AT THE SAME TIME WHY SHOULD THAT BE GOOD WELL BECAUSE I THINK IT IT REFLECTS EXPERIENCE MUCH MORE ACCURATELY

THE X DU FRANCE WHICH I BELIEVE I DID FRANK I THINK DID AND DID THE TRANSLATIONS THOUGH COME ABOUT AT THAT SAME TIME OR HAD YOU DONE A NUMBER OF THEM FOR THE ANTHOLOGY EARLIER OH YEAH THAT WAS AROUND THE SAME TIME I I F I F I FORGET EXACTLY WHY I SENT THEM TO EVERGREEN REVIEW WHICH TOOK FOREVER TO PUBLISH THEM AND AND I HEARD did not REALLY WANT TO REALLY WELL SOMEBODY SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN

HOUSE OF LORDS AND COMMONS EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE BY J M W TURNER SOME THREE PARTS AT ONE POINT IN THE STORY THE RAIN WAS GREEN AND THE SKY WAS PINK SHOT THROUGH WITH PAINTERLY STREAKS OF MAUVE AND GRAY every one INCLUDING THE SERVANTS AND MAIDS WENT ONTO THE VERANDA AND BEGAN APPLAUDING IT was not YET EVENING EVEN THOSE WHO WERE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE NARRATIVE THOSE LIKE {us / u. s.} WHO HAD NO PLACE IN THE STORY WERE INVITED TO ATTEND THIS MOMENTOUS EVENT ALONG THE RIVERBANKS THE FULSOME REFLECTIONS OF FLOWERS BLOSSOMED IN EVERY IMAGINABLE HUE SOME COLORS FLOATED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SKY LIKE BOATS FERRYING THE DEAD TO THEIR DESTINATION TWISTED MAZES OF SPARKS LED THE WAY IT WAS A CELEBRATION AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF DREAD AND JOY WE WERE LOST WITHIN A SWIRLING STORM OF SERAPHIC COLOR DRIPPING WITH THE REVELATIONS THE SKY HAD FLUNG IN OUR FACES {that's / that is / that has} WHEN IT CAME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THE PALACE IS ON FIRE BUT NO ONE DARED CROSS THE RIVER AND APPROACH ITS GATES THIS WAS A DIFFERENT STORY ITS NARRATIVE PROMISING THAT THE CONSTRUCTION AND DESTRUCTION OF CIVIL ORDER WOULD OCCUR NATURALLY LIKE THE WEATHER NEAR THE FLAGS FLYING WITHIN IT THIS IS THE STORY NONE OF {us

SENSUAL ASIDES COULD UNFOLD with out INTERRUPTION ON THE SMALL SHELLS ON WHICH WE PRETENDED TO SLEEP WHEN VAST CONSTELLATIONS OF VILLAINOUS LITHOGRAPHY PROWLED THE LAND LOOKING FOR COMPONENTS TO EVAPORATE INTO BURSTS OF FIERY LAUGHTER WE realiseD THE WORLD WAS POROUS AND THAT WE WERE HANDFULS OF SAND TRICKLING THROUGH ITS OPENINGS INTO THE SEA WAITING BELOW HOW TO HOLD ON TO OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER with out THREATENING THE SEEDLINGS BENEATH THE SKIN IN THE BEGINNING WE TOLD OURSELVES THERE WAS AN EXIT SOMEWHERE FOR {us / u. s.} TO BEGIN MAKING UP WHAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD NEVER WOULD LATER WE TOLD EACH LATER WE TOLD EACH OTHER IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS A WINDOW WITH A VIEW OF PARADISE WE SILENTLY AGREED THAT THE WINDOW does not OPEN BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER THERE BUT THAT THE SHADOWS OF ITS IMPRINT COULD BE SEEN ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SOME DAYS WE SIT FACING THEM TRYING TO DECIPHER THEIR PROMISES BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WE LOOK THE OTHER WAY STILL

ALL AT ONCE UNDER A TREE TAKEN UP AND SHAKEN AGAIN PUT DOWN IN WEAK RAGE KNOWING AS THE BRAIN DOES IT CAN NEVER COME ABOUT NOT HERE NOT YESTERDAY IN THE PAST ONLY IN THE GAP OF TODAY FILLING ITSELF AS EMPTINESS IS DISTRIBUTED IN THE IDEA OF WHAT TIME IT IS WHEN THAT TIME HAS ALREADY PASSED SCHEHERAZADE UNSUPPORTED BY REASON'S ENIGMA WATER COLLECTS IN SQUARED STONE CATCH BASINS THE LAND IS DRY UNDER IT MOVES THE WATER FISH LIVE IN THE WELLS THE LEAVES A CONCERNED GREEN ARE SCRAWLED ON THE WHITE BAD BINDWEED AND RANK RAGWEED some how FORGET TO FLOURISH HERE AN INEXHAUSTIBLE WARDROBE HAS BEEN PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF EACH NEW OCCURENCE IT CAN BE ITSELF NOW DAYS ALMOST RELUCTANT TO DECLINE AND SLOWING DOWN OPENS OUT NEW AVENUES THAT do not INFRINGE ON SPACE BUT ARE LIVING HERE WITH {us / u. s.} OTHER DREAMS CAME AND LEFT WHILE A BANK OF COLORED VERBS AND ADJECTIVES WAS SHRINKING FROM THE LIGHT TO NURSE IN SHADE THEIR WANT OF A METHOD BUT MOST OF ALL SHE LOVED THE PARTICLES THAT TRANSFORMED OBJECTS OF THE SAME CATEGORY INTO PARTICULAR ONES EACH DISTINCT WITHIN AND APART FROM ITS OWN CLASS IN ALL THIS SPRINGING UP WAS NO HINT OF A TIDE ONLY A PLEASANT WAVERING OF THE AIR IN WHICH ALL THINGS SEEMED PRESENT WHETHER JUST PASSED OR SOON TO COME IT WAS ALL INVITATION SO MUCH THE FLOWERS OUTLINED ALONG THE NIGHT ALLEYS WHEN FEW WERE VISIBLE YET THEIR STORY SOUNDED LOUDER THAN THE HUM OF BUG AND STICK NOISES THAT BROUGHT UP THE REAR TRUNDLING IT ALONG INTO A NEW FACT OF DAY THESE WERE MEANT TO BE READ AS ANY SALUTATION BEFORE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS BUT THEY STUCK TO THEIR GUNS AND SO MUCH WITH THEIR OBSTINACY IN KEEPING WITH THE REST LIKE LONG FLASHES OF WHITE BIRDS THAT REFUSED TO DIE WHEN DAY DOES THAT NONE KNEW THE WARP WHICH PRESENTED THIS MAJOR MOVEMENT AS A FIRM DIGRESSION A PLAIN THAT SLOWLY BECOMES A MOUNTAIN SO EACH FOUND HIMSELF CAUGHT IN A NET AS A FASHION AND ALL EFFORTS TO WRIGGLE FREE INVOLVED HIM FURTHER INEXORABLY SINCE ALL EXISTED THERE TO BE TOLD SHOT THROUGH FROM BORDER TO BORDER HERE WERE STONES THAT READ AS PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THERE WAS A STORY OF THE GRANDPARENTS OF THE VIGOROUS YOUNG CHAMPION THE LINES ONCE GIVEN TO ANOTHER NOW RESTORED TO THE NEW SPEAKER DINNERS AND ASSEMBLIES THE LIGHT IN THE OLD HOME THE SECRET WAYS THE ROOMS FED INTO EACH OTHER BUT ALL WAS WARINESS OF TIME WATCHING ITSELF FOR NOTHING IN THE COMPLEX STORY GREW OUTSIDE THE GREATNESS IN THE MOMENT OF TELLING STAYED UNRESOLVED UNTIL ITS WEALTH OF INCIDENT PAIN MIXED WITH PLEASURE FADED IN THE PRECISE MOMENT OF BURSTING INTO BLOOM ITS GROWTH A STATIC LAMENT SOME STORIES SURVIVE THE DYNASTY OF THE BUILDERS BUT THEIR ECHO WAS ITSELF LOCKED IN BECAME ANTICIPATION THAT WAS ONLY MEMORY AFTER ALL FOR THE POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITED IT IS SEEN AT THE END THAT THE KIND AND GOOD ARE REWARDED THAT THE UNJUST ONE IS DOOMED TO BURN FOREVER AROUND HIS ERROR SADDER AND WISER ANYWAY BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES THE OTHERS MUDDLED THROUGH LIKE {us / u. s.} UNCERTAIN BUT WEARING ARTLESSLY THEIR FUNCTION OF MINOR CHARACTERS WHO MUST BE KEPT IN MIND IT IS WE WHO MAKE THIS JUNGLE AND CALL IT SPACE NAMING EACH ROUTE EACH SERPENT FOR THE SOUND OF THE NAME AS IT CLINKS DULLY AGAINST OUR PLEASURE INDIFFERENCE THAT IS PLEASURE AND WOULD THEY BE with out AN AUDIENCE TO RESTRICT THE INNUMERABLE PASSES AND SWIPES RESTORED TO GOOD HUMOR AS IT ISSUES INTO THE IMPERVIOUS EVENING AIR SO IN SOME WAY ALTHOUGH THE ARITHMETIC IS INCORRECT THE BALANCE IS RESTORED BECAUSE IT BALANCES KNOWING IT PREVAILS AND THE MAN WHO MADE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE IS EXONERATED THE TOMB OF

THOUSAND MILES AND WHEN IT IS DAY IN ONE IT IS NIGHT IN THE OTHER AS THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN TAIPEI MARVELED OVER THE ASTOUNDING CONNECTION THEY HAD JUST UNCOVERED THEY realiseD THAT THEIR TWO SISTERS WERE PROBABLY ASLEEP AT THAT MOMENT ON THE SAME FLOOR OF THE SAME BUILDING IN NORTHERN MANHATTAN EACH ONE WAS SLEEPING IN HER OWN APARTMENT UNAWARE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ABOUT THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD ALTHOUGH THEY WERE neighbourS IT TURNED OUT THAT THE TWO SISTERS IN NEW YORK DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WHEN THEY FINALLY MET TWO YEARS LATER NEITHER ONE OF THEM WAS LIVING IN THAT BUILDING any more SIRI AND I WERE MARRIED THEN ONE EVENING ON OUR WAY TO AN APPOINTMENT SOMEWHERE WE HAPPENED TO STOP IN AT A BOOKSTORE ON BROADWAY TO BROWSE FOR A FEW MINUTES WE MUST HAVE

WORK THEN IN A BOMBASTIC PRETENTIOUS STYLE RIDDLED WITH QUOTATIONS FROM FRENCH PHILOSOPHERS AND OOZING WITH A TONE OF CONCEIT AND SELF SATISFACTION THE LETTER WRITER WENT ON TO PRAISE ROBERT FOR THE IDEAS HE HAD DEVELOPED ABOUT ONE OF MY BOOKS AT A COLLEGE COURSE ON THE CONTEMPORARY NOVEL IT WAS A CONTEMPTIBLE LETTER THE KIND OF LETTER I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF WRITING TO ANYONE AND YET IT WAS SIGNED WITH MY NAME THE HANDWRITING DID NOT RESEMBLE MINE BUT THAT WAS SMALL COMFORT SOMEONE WAS OUT THERE TRYING TO IMPERSONATE ME AND AS FAR AS I KNOW HE STILL IS ONE FRIEND SUGGESTED THAT THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF MAIL ART KNOWING THAT THE LETTER COULD NOT BE DELIVERED TO ROBERT MORGAN SINCE THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON THE AUTHOR OF THE LETTER WAS ACTUALLY ADDRESSING HIS REMARKS TO ME BUT THAT WOULD IMPLY AN UNWARRANTED FAITH IN THE {us / u. s.} POSTAL SERVICE AND I DOUBT THAT SOMEONE WHO WOULD GO TO THE TROUBLE OF ORDERING ADDRESS LABELS IN MY NAME AND THEN SITTING DOWN TO WRITE SUCH AN ARROGANT HIGH FLOWN LETTER WOULD LEAVE ANYTHING TO CHANCE OR WOULD HE PERHAPS THE SMART ALECKS OF THIS WORLD BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING WILL ALWAYS GO THEIR WAY I HAVE SCANT HOPE OF EVER GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS LITTLE MYSTERY THE PRANKSTER DID A GOOD JOB OF COVERING HIS TRACKS AND HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE WHAT PUZZLES ME ABOUT MY OWN BEHAVIOR IS THAT I HAVE NOT THROWN AWAY THE LETTER EVEN THOUGH IT CONTINUES TO GIVE ME CHILLS EVERY TIME I LOOK AT IT

ENTERS YOUR MEMORY THAT {there's / there is / there has} NO PRESENT OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HER IS YOUR EXPECTATION every one BECOMES GREAT IN PROPORTION TO A SINGER'S SPURIOUS EXPECTATIONS LIKE SO MANY GOOD MISTAKES PARACHUTE ON THE DESERT BLUE WITH LIGHT ELEVEN SHEEP HEAD TO HEAD IN A CIRCLE ASLEEP ENJOYMENT AND SUBSTANCE IN REAL TIME INVOLVE CLEARINGS ABOUT WHICH PIVOT OPAQUE ZONES REAL IS A SPAN OF VISIBILITY IN AS MUCH AS YOUR FLESH IS NOT CHAOTIC OF A CONTINGENCY THE REAL THING SUBSTITUTES FOR ANOTHER {who's / who is / who has} NOT REPRESENTABLE AS HE GATHERS UP PARACHUTE AND DELIVERY IF I STAY HERE AND YOU MEAN SOMETHING THE PART IN COMMON IS DISJUNCT FROM WHAT YOU MEAN LIKE MY HANDS TOUCHING THAT {you are / you were} TELEPATHIC MEANS NOTHING YOU FACTS YOU {can not / cannot} KNOW WHICH STILL WORK IN THE CONNECTIONS OF MY EXPERIENCE A ROCK IN RAIN DISTRIBUTING WATER ALONG TEXTURE IS MY RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE INASMUCH AS YOUR FLESH IS AN INVISIBLE INTERPLAY OF DISJUNCTION NEEDED FOR IDENTITY FLESH IS TEXTURE OUR MEETING OCCURS NEAR A HILL YOU CLIMB EVERY DAY TO WATER TRANSPLANTED IRIS WHY do not YOU LET OTHERS DO THAT ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WISH TO SEPARATE FROM HIM NOW DUE TO FAULTS OF COMPOUND PHENOMENA BEING DEMONSTRATED IT SEEMS HE WILL DISAPPEAR FROM MY SIGHT AND HEARING THE BEAUTY OF HIS SONG DERIVES FROM THE FACT IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING TO SOMEONE ANY FAMILY {that's / that is / that has} CONCENTRATED IN SO FAR AS IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING MAY BE TAKEN FOR SOMEONE WHEREVER {there's / there is / there has} WAITING IS THIS TRANSFERENCE THE DANGER IS you will BE DECEIVED BY THE METONYMY OF MY TENDER FEELING SO LIGHT AND MULTIPLE YOU GO TO PICK UP THE CHILD AFTER SCHOOL YOU REMAIN A FEW MOMENTS TALKING WITH A TEACHER BESIDE THE LOOM WHY ARE YOU TELLING HER THIS GLORY FORMLESS SUBSTANCE CIRCULAR DAWN LIKE A {child's / child is / child has} DRAWING OF STARS OR SNOWFLAKES AND LINES EACH LINE CONNECTS SO {it's / it is / it has} THE SAME STAR FALLING LOOP TO LOOP AND EACH LINE BELONGS TO EACH STAR MY FRIEND THE WHITE RABBIT LITTLE MOUSE SQUIRREL IMPATIENT SHAKING OFF THEIR CLOTHES I WANTED TO WRITE A A POEM FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THE FERTILE AREA OF THE MARGIN BUT THEN WHEN I WROTE IT IT WAS CALLED NEST AND {it's / it is / it has} IN IN FIVE PARTS MY MOTHER TONGUE CHINESE HAS AN IMMEMORIAL HISTORY BEFORE ME I WAS INSERTED INTO IT A MOTIVE FOR MY LANGUAGE I LEARNED IT NATURALLY FILLING IT WITH INTENTIONS AND WILL LEAVE IT with out INTENT FOR OTHER CHILDREN MY MOTHER AND I SPEAK A LOCAL LANGUAGE AND some timeS OUR MOTHER TONGUE AS IN MY DREAM WITH ITS INTENT WHAT DO YOU INTEND IN CHANGING THE MOTHER TONGUE OF MY DAUGHTER COMPASSION NOT BEING ILL SLEEP IN WHICH SHE RESONATES DEPTH LIKE A BELL LOVING THE WIND IS EQUIVALENT TO INTENTION AS RHETORICAL SURFACE LIKE WRITING A DIARY ON HER SKIN NON COMPREHENSION TIPS AMBIVALENT MATTER AS IF THERE WERE TWO OF {us / u. s.} HERE ONE IS ONE IS MOTHER TONGUE HER MATTER INSERTED A MOTIVE IS ALWAYS SOMEWHERE ELSE EXITING ONE LANGUAGE ANOTHER with out INTENT TRANSLATED AS HEART I WANT TO TELL YOU {what's / what is / what has / what does} DIFFICULT TO ADMIT THAT I LEFT HOME CHANGE OF MOTHER TONGUE BETWEEN {us / u. s.} ACTIVATES AN IMMUNE SYSTEM MARGIN WHERE DWELLING AND TRAVEL ARE NOT DISTINCT THE ARTIFACTS THROW THEMSELVES TOWARD LIGHT with out BECOMING SIGNIFICATION TELLING YOU IS NOT AN EDGE OF THE LIGHT {there's / there is / there has} NO MARGIN OF A SHADOW TO IMPLY INTERIOR IN MY CHILDHOOD HOUSE WAS A DEEP PORCH COVERED WITH VINES LOOK PAST OUR SILHOUETTE TO SILHOUETTES LIKE SHADOWS OF GUESTS ARRIVING IN THE BRIGHT YARD LIGHT IN THE NEXT ROOM FALLS ON HER AS SHE BENDS TO KISS YOU SKYLIGHT POURS DOWN THEN COVERS THE MUD WALL LIKE CLOTH I OBSERVE THE LIGHTED FEEL THAT SEEMS TO HANG IN SPACE IN FRONT OF ME SPEAKING NOT FILLING IN A SURFACE INTENT IS LIKE A CABINET OF ARTIFACTS COMPARISON COEXISTING WITH INCONGRUITY MY ORIGIN IS A LINGUISTIC SURFACE LIKE A DECORATED WALL NO LITTLE HOUSES AT DUSK YELLOW LIGHTS COMING ON PHYSICAL MUTE ITS SIGNIFICANCE IS RECEIVED OUTSIDE HEARING DECORATING SIMPLY BY OPENING THE VIEW WHEREVER I LOOK IS PRIOR ABSENCE NO FIGURE RUIN ESCAPING AN AESTHETIC HAMMOCK ELECTRIC FAN GHOST do not QUALIFY AS GUARDS THE COMFORTABLE INTERIOR MY GUEST INHABITS IS A MOVING BASE STATES OF DWELLING THAT ARE UNDETERMINED WALLS CROSS HATCHED LIKE MOTHER TONGUES A FOREIGN WOMAN OCCUPIES A HOME {that's / that is / that has} IMPERSONAL LIKE THE NEST OF A PARASITE ITS VALUE IS CONTENTLESS BUT PHOTOGRAPH IN THE CONTEXT OF AN INDIGENOUS POPULATION TIPPING BETWEEN PHYSICAL EASE AND THE FREEDOM OF ANIMALS ACCUMULATING RISK WHEN THE SCENE IS COMPLEX I TURN TO THE AUDIENCE AND COMMENT OUT LOUD THEN RETURN TO THE ROOM AND LANGUAGE AT HAND WEAKENED BY who ever did not HEAR ME AS IF I do not recognise THE ROLE BECAUSE MY FAMILY MOVED IN WHILE I WAS AWAY AS TEXT IMPLICATED WITH OUTSIDE THE WALL IS WAVES SO I DECORATE IN NEW MOTHER TONGUE X
Berssenbrugge-Mei-Mei_Complete-Recording_Segue-DH_NYC_2-21-98 A a 0.154 439.929 SO YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORD FOR HAPPINESS THAT WAS FORMERLY INNOCENT THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM WHEN STIMULATED PRODUCES A CHARACTERISTIC SIGN THE SINUS EXTENDS ITSELF DURING STRESS AND COLLAPSES SO THE A AUTOPSY FINDS ONLY A MEMBRANE TOUCHING A WALL PRODUCES THE SOUND OF TOUCH ON ANOTHER WALL FEEDBACK BETWEEN HEALTH AND FATE UNFOLDS SO FAST {there's / there is / there has} NO WAY ONE STEP IN THE CHAIN CAN BE BASED ON THE PREVIOUS ONE AN ASSOCIATED SMEAR OR AURA REQUIRES HER TO BE IN A BODY IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS LACK OF CLOUD COVER CAUSES THERMAL ENERGY ON THE DESERT TO RETURN RAPIDLY TO THE SKY AT NIGHT OXYGENATING MOLECULES MAKES LIGHT LIGHTING THE ORGANS THEY TURN WHITE {there's / there is / there has} A SPACE YOU SEE SOMETHING AT THE FAR EDGE AND YOUR EYE GOING OVER THIS SPACE MAKES A HOLE LIKE WATERY MASS IN A GOURD THE FEELING OF OLD ORGANS NO LONGER CRUCIAL TO OR INSIDE THEMSELVES WHILE REMEMBERING PEOPLE YOU LOVED WHICH FLOWED FROM THE PHYSICAL ABOUT WHICH YOU MADE DECISIONS TO MAKE THIS WHOLE ANY OBJECT BRINGS INTO BEING SOMETHING NOT IN NATURE AN INTERIOR MEASUREMENT YOURSELF NOT YOURSELF BURSTS OF GROWTH WHEN YOU SLEEP HER BACK BLEEDS A SPRAY OF BLOOD ON THE SNOW SHE SITS ON HER HANDS PHYSICALLY PREVENTING HERSELF FROM SCRATCHING THE CHILD HER SENSE OF THE WORLD BEING CRUCIAL TO OR INSIDE ITSELF OF MEMORY AND SPECIFICITY LIKE SCRIPT THESE CELLS GROW FOR YEARS IN A PETRI DISH THE SICK IMMORTALIZED CELLS do not KNOW TO STOP GROWING WHERE YOUR EYE GOES OVER SPACE TO THE HORIZON MAKES A HOLE BUT WHERE THE SKY MEETS THE EARTH THE FRAGMENT IS NOT THE SAME AS A WHOLE DESERT FERNS COVERED WITH REFLECTING HAIR MAY INSULATE THE FRONDS RADIATIONS OF A STATE THOROUGHLY EMBODIED AND DISSOLVING ENCOUNTER REFLECTIONS OF LIGHT THERE IS AN ENGINE HE can not SEPARATE FROM THE LOVED PERSON TO SHED THE LOVED BODY SO THIS IS THE FIRST POEM I I WROTE SINCE I FINISHED THE FOUR YEAR OLD GIRL MANUSCRIPT IT HAS A MORE NARRATIVE STYLE {it's / it is / it has} CALLED SUSIE KIKI ANNIE AND {it's / it is / it has} IN THREE PARTS SUSIE KIKI ANNIE ON ITS OWN TERMS MY PROJECT WITH THEM DEVELOPED A GENTLE MOMENTUM THE VULNERABILITY OF THEIR SITUATION ENGENDERED BY AN UNASSUMING SPIRIT OF PLAY AND TOGETHERNESS ON MY WAY TO WORK i have HAD SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS STANDING IN A GROUP CLOSE TOGETHER I ASKED EACH ONE TO TELL ME HIS OR HER THOUGHTS AND I TRIED TO REMEMBER THEM ALL MY SISTER HAS JUST FIXED THE MOTORCYCLE OF HER FRIEND TOM AND { she's / she was / she is / she has} WAITING FOR HIM AMONG THEM A FOX TURNS TO LOOK AT ME AS IF IN NATURE BUT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DRAWN IT {it's / it is / it has} SYMBOLIC WHAT CAN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE MY SISTER ENCOMPASS ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL IF SHE WERE NOT MY SISTER OR IF I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORMAL RELATION A PROJECTOR IN THE DARK CASTS A LINE OF LIGHT UNDER THE DOOR ENERGY OF THE GAP BETWEEN MY SISTER AND THE STRATEGY THAT CONSTRUES HER AS PURE APPEARANCE DISPERSES ALONG THE WEB OF FAMILY INTERRELATIONS {there's / there is / there has} A STRINGENT PHYSICAL LINK BUT WHAT GOES ON INSIDE HER SEEMS CLOSE TO FREEDOM I KNOW AS MY POWER OF IMAGINATION SO STRONG IT APPEARS AS A DELIBERATE LOSS OF INFORMATION ONE FOX AN OPEN STRUCTURE EMPTIES LIKE A FUNNEL ONE FOX ENTERS THE WORLD IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE AN IMAGE {there's / there is / there has} A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM IN WHICH SHE IS INVOLVED WALKING BETWEEN ANIMALS ASLEEP AND LATE LIGHT LIKE BLOOD UNINTERESTED IN THE ALLEGED REALISM OF THE FOX WHILE SHE SEES IT AS ACTUALLY BEHIND THE SCENES THEY WATCH ME IN SUSPENSE THERE IS A MUTE PROBABILITY OF A RECIPROCAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING LATELY i have BEEN INTERESTED IN FAILING TO MAKE SOMETHING EXCITING EQUATING THE ACT OF WALKING FROM ONE TREE TO ANOTHER WITH UNDERSTANDING I TRY TO SPEAK TO HER IN A WAY IN WHICH SHE MIGHT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY AND ANSWER BACK THE SITUATION IS AN IMAGE OF HER GATHERING A TOY HORSE FROM BESIDE EACH CANDLE OF MY SISTER ON A WHITE HORSE OF THE HORSE STEPPING BACKWARDS IN WATER SHE STANDS THERE FOR A LONG TIME AND TAKES OUT OF HER POCKET ONE OF THE TOY HORSES SHE TELLS ME ABOUT IT AS IF I WERE ALSO A LOVER OF HORSES BUT I AM NOT AS SHE WELL KNOWS THE WAY IN WHICH SHE SHARES HER HAPPINESS AS A MATTER OF COURSE GIVES ME A SENSE OF GUILT BECAUSE I DO NOT FEEL THE HAPPINESS ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE STORY WHO EVENTUALLY DIE CONSIST OF TINY LINES SCRATCHED INTO REDDISH GROUND THE WHITE OF AN EYE IS SCRATCHED AWAY BUT THE PUPIL IS INK MANY APPEAR SLEEPY AS IF THEY HAD JUST WAKENED UP SQUIRREL LITTLE CAT FAWN SHE WEARS AN OILY SMOCK AND CLOTHES WITH A RUBBER DAISY ON EACH ONE LIGHT GLINTS OFF HER GLASSES AS SHE WAITS WITH AN AWKWARDNESS {that's / that is / that has} BOTH CONSPICUOUS AND NONCHALANT SHE FEELS THEIR PRESENCE IN THE WOODS AS AN A PRIORI MODEL LIGHT SUBJECT TO DECLINE HER EMPATHY MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO READ THE STORY AND SEE IT AS A PICTURE AT THE SAME TIME IS THIS STORY OF DEFEAT AND DISAPPOINTMENT UNCERTAINTY INTERFERENCE MALFUNCTION TRANSCENDED BY THE PRESENT SITUATION OF COMPETENT EMPLOYMENT SHE LOSES TRACK OF HER THOUGHT THEN RESUMES AFTER LAUGHING AT HERSELF THE HORSE TAKES A SMALL JUMP IN THE AIR AND HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARCH BACK I SEE MINNIE MOUSE INSTEAD OF A THIN GIRL IN A COTTON SMOCK THE AMBIGUITY RELEASES ENERGY NO ONE ENTERS THE FAMILY UNIT EXCEPT THROUGH THE MAGNETISM OF THIS ENERGY STOLID GIRLS SCOUT LIKE AN OLD MAN WILD GIRLS IN A MEADOW IN THE AFTERNOON ARE SUBJECT TO AN EVALUATION IN WHICH CHEAPNESS can not BE AVOIDED SHE MARKS TIME WITH HER HAND AND THE HORSE CURLS ITS NECK AND HEAD AROUND HER
Bervin-Jen_Complete-Recording_Contemporary-Writers-Series_Mills-College_9-28-10 A a 1.189 467.961 THE EXHILARATION COMES UP VERY CLOSE THE OBJECTS IN IT LOOK LIKE FAMILIAR THINGS IT HAPPENS AT TIMES THAT COME TO {us / u. s.} IN A DIRECT LINE AS LIGHT MOVING AT A PRETTY PACE PEOPLE IN DELIRIUM MOVE TOWARD IT IT HAS ONE OF NATURE'S FAILINGS LOVELINESS IS NOT DELUXE WHEN {it's / it is / it has} UNCERTAIN STRANGE WE HAVE COME BACK SO THIS TYPE STUDY IS WHAT STARTED ALL THE TROUBLE WITH ANY OTHERS COMING {i had / i would} LONG BEEN A FAN OF HER WORK AND HAD ON WEAVING AND KNEW IT WELL IT had not I JUST SAW IT DIFFERENTLY ONE DAY AND I WENT TO SOME LENGTHS TO TRY TO PUBLISH IT AND IT TOOK A LOT JUST WANTED TO COVER THE THINGS THAT I DO AND THAT THAT AND THEY PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHOR'S FOUNDATION WHICH OPENED UP A LITTLE BIT OF A PANDORA'S BOX BECAUSE THEY BROUGHT OUT SO MANY AMAZING THINGS WHEN I WENT TO VISIT I WAS THEN IN SO I STUDIED WEAVING AND THEN STARTED WORKING ON MY OWN LITTLE TYPE STUDIES AND I do not KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT WHEN I DO MONOTONOUS WORK LIKE HAMMERING AWAY ON A YOU KNOW A GRIDDED TYPEWRITER SPACE LIKE THIS i am ALWAYS LISTENING TO THINGS SO AT THIS POINT I WAS LISTENING TO A L REALLY AMAZING INTERVIEW WITH SUSAN HOWE AND CHARLES BERNSTEIN {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THE THE VERY EARLY LINE BREAK AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH BUT THEY JUST THEY HAD THIS STELLAR CONVERSATION ABOUT LANDSCAPE AND PAGE SPACE WHERE SUSAN HOWE EQUATES PAGE SPACE TO FREEDOM SALT AND SAND THIS IS ANNIE AND JOSEPH HAD BLACK MOUNTAIN COLLEGE AND THIS IS LAURA COUNTY LIVINGFIELD ONE OF {annie's / annie is / annie has} STUDENTS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE TO GRADUATE FROM BLACK MOUNTAIN AS I RECALL AND SHE TOOK THE WEAVING COURSE FROM ANNIE AND FROM ANOTHER TEACHER THERE AND THANKFULLY GOT LIKE TWO HUNDRED PAGES OF EXTRAORDINARY NOTES ALL HAND TYPED WITH LOTS OF DRAFT NOTATION AND DRAWINGS AND WHILE I WAS AT THE ELDER'S ARCHIVE OR ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT UP THERE AFTER I DIGITIZED HER ENTIRE FILE BECAUSE IT WAS DE DETERIORATING RATHER RAPIDLY AND MAYBE OF LESSER VALUE THAN SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THERE SO I SCANNED IT AND I HAVE IT AND NOW i am JUST WONDERING WONDERING WHAT TO DO i am going to GIVE A TALK IN A FEW DAYS ON THE ARCHIVE BUT LIKE OTHER PROJECTS IT TAKES ME A LONG TIME TO SORT OF GET FAR ENOUGH TO THAT I KNOW WHAT i am DOING WITH SOMETHING SO I JUST SPENT A LOT OF TIME LEARNING I DID TRACE THE TYPE STUDIES FROM BLACK MOUNTAIN BACK TO THE BAUHAU THIS IS A A WEAVING CLOTH SAMPLE BOOK OF SOME OF THE TYPE DESIGNS THIS IS MY favourITE BAUHAUS STUDY DONE BY HAJA ROSE OF JUST ZEROES AND LINES is not IT GORGEOUS SO {it's / it is / it has} A MILLION RANDOM DIGITS SEE I TOTALED THEM UP YEAH THINK JOHN CAGE USED THIS QUITE A BIT TRACK SOME OF THEM DOWN SO THOSE OF YOU WHO WEAVE OR MIGHT WEAVE WOULD KNOW THAT WEAVING'S ALL ABOUT NUMBERS SO EVERY THREAD EVERY INTERSECTION OF THE THREAD CORRESPONDS TO AT LEAST TWO NUMBERS SO EVEN THOUGH {you are / you were} LOOKING AT A VERY SIMPLE PIECE OF CLOTH YOU COULD REALLY DRAW IT OUT NUMERICALLY IN ITS ENTIRETY SO THE PIECE THAT I DID FOR THE THE BOOK WAS SIMPLY A TRANSCRIPTION A LOVELY TRANSCRIPTION OF THAT PAGE SPACE I WAS GIVING A TALK RECENTLY AND THEN I DID A LITTLE HOMEWORK ON ETYMOLOGY OF TEXT AND TEXTILE AND THEY COME FROM THE VERY SAME STEM TO WEAVE BUT I LOVE THE TEXT ACTUALLY HAS A EVEN A MORE FABRIC DESCRIPTION OF STYLE TISSUE OF LITERARY WORK LITERALLY THAT WHICH IS WOVEN WEB TEXTURE SO NICE THE WAY {it's / it is / it has} THERE SO THERE EARLY ON SO {that's / that is / that has} IT THOUGHT WE COULD OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS YOU GAVE {us / u. s.} HAVE PLENTY OF TIME i am CURIOUS ABOUT THE DICKINSON QUOTES I NOTICE FROM THE IMAGES THAT THERE WERE IT SEEM IT SEEMED TO ME SPECIFICALLY THAT {there's / there is / there has} A BUNCH OF SIMILAR MARKINGS BUT {they are / they were} SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DO THEY CORRESPOND TO A CERTAIN THING LIKE FROM THE WORK LIKE THE THE THE THE THE WAY THAT YOU SEWED THE FABRIC IN JUST THE PREGNANT DID IT LIKE HOW DOES THAT HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WHAT TO PUT WHERE RIGHT {it's / it is / it has} AS FAITHFUL A TRANSCRIPTION AS I COULD MAKE SO WHAT I DID WAS I SCANNED DICKINSON'S MANUSCRIPT BOOKS WHICH YOU YOU HAVE HERE YOU HAVE A FANTASTIC DICKINSON COLLECTION SO {it's / it is / it has} A TWO VOLUME BOOK OF THE FOLIO WORK THAT SHE DID AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY A A TON MORE MANU HER MANUSCRIPTS THAT are not IN THAT EDITION SO THAT ARE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL EVEN THE STRANGE THE LIGHT FRAGMENTS BUT I WORKED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT SHOWED THE VARIANT SYSTEM SO ALL THOSE CROSSES THAT YOU SAW EMBROIDERED PRECEDE WORDS AND THE WORDS CORRESPOND TO OTHER WORDS PRECEDED BY A CROSS WITHIN THE POEM SO {there's / there is / there has} THIS RATHER INTENSE SYSTEM OF ALTERNATE OR OTHER WAYS TO READ POEMS AND {they are / they were} VERY STRANGE I MEAN some timeS {they are / they were} CLOSE LIKE LIKE FURTHER AND FARTHER WHICH are not REALLY CLOSE AT ALL AND some timeS {they are / they were} LIKE LIKE THE LINES LIKE 'TIS IS 'TIS AS IF OUR SOULS ABSCONDED SUDDENLY AND THE VARIANT IS SOULS AND THE VARIANTS BELOW THE POEM ARE WORLD SELVES AND SUN OH OH SO EITHER ANY OF THOSE COULD HAPPEN AND THEN WHEN YOU START TO READ THE VARIANTS WHA BETWEEN POEMS SO SAY SOULS I IS A VARIANT MORE THAN ONCE THEN YOU HAVE A VERY COMPLEX WAY THAT YOU START TO GET TO READ YEAH X

AND THEN THE LAST SECTION IS AN ASSOCIATIVE DICTIONARY CALLED FESTOON DICTIONARY WHICH IS WHICH IS NOT ALPHABETICAL SO THE BOOK MOVES FROM TALES THAT ARE ROUGHLY ABOUT A PAGE TO THE THREE WORLD TALES TO THEN THE TALE WITHIN EACH WORD SO i will READ A FEW DICTIONARY ENTRIES CHECKERED CAREFUL IN THE OBSERVANCE OF QUICK FIRE AND CEREMONY SUPERSTITION THE SPINE OF A HERRING WITH THE RIBS EXTENDED HOOF THE QUALITY OF BEING STRIDENT WE STRUCK THE MAIN ROAD IMPETUOUSLY PLOW ANTIDOTE TO STIFFENING OTHER UNKNOWN SOUND OF CERTAINTY CRIMSON THAT PORTION OF FLOOR OF A ROOM ON WHICH A FIRE STANDS BARRICADE

AT THE MOMENT WORK IN PROGRESS SO STARTING WITH TWO QUOTATIONS FROM SHAKESPEARE SOME PRIVATE SCORPION DO YOU PONTIFICATE AND FROM SHELLEY A MIND THAT BROODS OVER GUILTY WOES IS LIKE A SCORPION GIRT BY FIRE SCORPION ODE I PRAY THE DICTIONARY I ASK PARDON OF DREAM I FEARED SCORPIONS IN THEIR SILENCE AND WALKED EACH MORNING INTO THE RISING MOUNTAIN I VOWED NOT TO BECOME THE NULLIFYING SILENCE BUT TO NULLIFY THE OTHER PARALYSIS BEING BORN TO SPEAK WITH THE ELEVATED PRECISION OF SILENCE FROM THE MARROW OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE LIVING ASPECT OF WHICH APPEARS SOLID BUT is not COMPLETE UNTIL WE HAVE LEFT THE WORD THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SCORPIONIC PREMISES DEPARTURE I SPEAK FROM ANOTHER VANTAGE THOUGH IT IS NOT MINE NOTHING IS ANYONE'S FORMALLY SPEAKING EVEN IF YOU WALK ALONG THIS PARTICULARITY OF GASPING ORDINATION A MIND IS MORE AKIN TO THE MOMENT IF YOU COULD HOLD IT AND WALK along side ME {i had / i would} BE SOMEWHERE DRIVEN TO THE PARTICLE WITHIN MINIATURE FLUCTUATIONS OF LIGHT NOT VISIBLE LIGHT BUT WHAT TURNS YOU AND PULLS YOU FROM YOUR BED ON A MORNING AS SUCH YOU WOULD RATHER NOT BE BIDDEN WAKEFUL REFRACTION IS THE MISSING TESTIMONY OF LEAVING WHERE ARE YOU GOING AND HOW WILL

Clay-Steve_Close-Listening_5-17-21 A a 0.035 373.768 A FASCINATING THING AND AND NOW we have BOTH HAD A CHANCE TO READ MORE LITERARY HISTORY SO SO WE KNOW GOING BACK TO BLAKE OF COURSE WHO WAS SUCH AN OUTSIDER AND PRINTED %bcack AND ENGRAVED CREATE HIS OWN ENGRAVING TECHNIQUES HIS OWN BOOKS BUT MOST L LITERARY MOST POETS EXIST WITHIN YOU KNOW MICRO NETWORKS OF PUBLISHERS OR book stores THAT PUBLISH THEIR WORK THAT CIRCULATE TO OTHER POETS AND YOU CAN SORT OF TRACE WHAT THOSE NETWORKS ARE %bcack AND i am NOT SAYING NETWORK IN A CONTEMPORARY BUREAUCRATIC SENSE I MEAN RIGHT YEAH YOU COULD TRACE THOSE CONNECTIONS BY LOOKING AT THE WHERE THE BOOKS F THE FLOW OF THE BOOKS YEAH OH YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND WHO PUBLISHES THEM SO {you are / you were} REALLY RIGHT AT THE centre SO WHILE YOU MIGHT YEAH {that's / that is / that has} ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING YEAH FOUND IT AND I COULD IMAGINE QUITE DIFFICULT BECAUSE DISTRIBUTION IS ALWAYS A A VERY DIFFICULT AND UNREWARDING THING none the less YOU LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE WHAT WAS GOING ON HOW THINGS WORKED WELL YEAH I DID AND I BUT I I WAS ALSO ST I WAS TRAVELING A BIT AND VISITING LIBRARIES AND {that's / that is / that has} HOW I WAS SELLING THE BOOKS THAT WE WERE DISTRIBUTING PEOPLE RARELY BOUGHT ANYTHING FROM A LIST THAT WE WOULD SEND OUT BUT IF I WOULD GO AROUND AND VISIT PEOPLE IN SPECIAL COLLECTIONS LIBRARIES YEAH THEY WOULD INVARIABLY BUY MANY THINGS MAYBE SO {that's / that is / that has} WHEN YOU GOT STARTED WITH THE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH SPECIAL COLLECTIONS AND LIBRARIES AND PLACING BOOKS THAT STARTED IT THE DISTRIBUTION AND THEN BUT THEN I realiseD WHEN I DID THE CAGE BOOK I I KNEW THAT IF I WENT AROUND AND SHOWED IT TO PEOPLE THAT THEY I WOULD BE ABLE TO SELL THIS YOU KNOW AND YEAH SO WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE HAVING THAT END POINT YOU KNOW THAT END USER POINT IN MIND AND {i had / i would} MET A LOT OF PEOPLE BY THEN I DID EARLY IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES I CAME OUT AND ATTENDED THE SOMETHING CALLED RARE BOOK SCHOOL THAT WAS A SUMMER programme AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY %bcack AND THIS WAS FILLED WITH ALL KINDS OF LIBRARIANS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND ELSEWHERE STUDYING ASPECTS OF RARE BOOKS AND THAT WAS VERY USEFUL IN BEGINNING TO MEET PEOPLE SOME OF THEM I STILL KNOW NOW ALL THIS TIME AND THEY WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR CAREER THEN AS WELL YEAH NOW M MAYBE A UNFAIR OR A STEREOTYPE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH R RARE BOOKS FOR SURE BUT FINE PRESS PRINTING APART FROM YOU AND CHARLES ALEXANDER AND A YOU KNOW A FEW OTHERS AND LEAVING ASIDE THE CHEAPER USE OF LETTERPRESS BY X BURNING DECK OR TUUMBA AND OTHERS would not HAVE BEEN INTERESTING CONTEMPORARIES ESPECIALLY NOT RADICAL INNOVATIVE POETRY THEY WOULD PUBLISH %bcack KNOWN WORKS AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE WORKS WERE PRINTED AND SET OR MORE CONVENTIONAL WRITING SO YOU WERE COMBINING VERY RADICAL POETIC CONTENT RADICAL IN THE SENSE OF UNCONVENTIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY %bcack VERSUS MORE TRADITIONAL RIGHT WORK YEAH {that's / that is / that has} WHY I WANTED X WAS I MY INTEREST IN THE BOOKS THAT WE WERE DISTRIBUTING WAS LIMITED TO THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE WORK AND AND AND THE CON AND AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CONTENT I did not WANT TO RIGHT X I I I LOVE MOBY DICK X A CHAPTER OF MOBY DICK X FAMOUSLY X GO DOWN ON THAT BUT YEAH THERE YOU GO X PROBABLY BE MORE THAN ONE BUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU MENTIONED {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A BEAUTIFUL THING TO BEHOLD AN X {it's / it is / it has} STILL NOT THE SAME AS DOING A JOHN CAGE BOOK OR OR ABSOLUTELY {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT YEAH EXACTLY YEAH OR OR OR OR OR JANE BRAKHAGE BOOK {it's / it is / it has} JUST {it's / it is / it has} A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING RIGHT RIGHT BUT WHAT i am INTERESTED IN DRAWING ON THAT FOR A SECOND IS YOU KNOW THE SYNCRETIC WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME IN POETICS IN YOUR CASE THE SYNCRETISM HAS TO DO WITH COMBINING ASPECTS OF A VERY TRADITIONAL FINE PRESS PRINTING %bcack AND KNOWLEDGE OF OF ANTIQUARIAN BOOKS WITH THIS VERY DIFFERENT CONTENT %bcack THAT YOU THAT YOU PUT INTO THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF {us / u. s.} I MEAN THINK ABOUT THE STUFF TH THAT I WAS PUBLISHING AS AS KIND OF A NONPUBLISHER PUBLISHER BUT STILL I MEAN X YOU KNOW WE TYPED STUFF AND WE XEROXED IT IT WAS FINE YEAH YEAH AND IT HAS A NICE QUALITY TO IT AND i am ALL FOR IT BUT X A LOT MORE PEOPLE DOING THE KIND OF STUFF THAT I WAS DOING WITH DESKTOP AND {it's / it is / it has} FINE THE REST LOT LESS PEOPLE %bcack EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO COULD HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID BECAUSE THEY JUST W would not HAVE KNOWN HOW TO DO IT YEAH YEAH THEY NO IT was not {you are / you were} RIGHT {you are / you were} RIGHT THERE were not THERE were not MANY MODELS REALLY I MEAN PERISHABLE PRESS DID PUBLISHED A LOT OF PEOPLE PAUL BLACKBURN ROBERT DUNCAN ROBERT CREELEY YEAH BUT HE DID IT HE DID IT IN A ONE HE DID IT IN HIS WAY IT WAS A VERY PERFECT WAY HE MADE THE IT IT WAS X VERY MUCH IN THE FINE PRINTING TRADITION AND I THINK THAT WHAT GRANARY DOES DID AND DOES WAS TO PUSH IT FURTHER AND TRY TO FIND A PROPER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALL OF THE MATERIALS OF TH THE OBJECT SO THIS BECOMES A KIND OF A CROSSOVER INTO WHAT YOU COULD CALL ART AS BOOKS NOW W AT WHAT POINT DID YOU BEGIN TO SEE YOUR WORK AT GRANARY AS THE PUBLISHER OF {artist's / artist is / artist has} BOOKS BECAUSE WE have not USED THAT TERM UP UNTIL NOW RIGHT X WE TALK ABOUT POETRY FINE PRESS BUT YET WE have not WE have not YEAH YEAH IF {you are / you were} LOOKING AT IT FROM TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THE FIRST THING THAT ONE WOULD SAY ABOUT GRANARY BOOKS %bcack THOUGH NOT THE ONLY THING IS IS THAT YOU DID {artist's / artist is / artist has} BOOKS YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT I I WAS AWARE OF {artist's / artist is / artist has} BOOKS IN MANY OF THE VERSIONS OF WAYS OF DEFINING THAT FROM THE SOCALLED DEMOCRATIC MULTIPLE X AND SAW THE WIT IN OTHERS THE KINDS OF BOOKS you will SEE AT PRINTED MATTER AS WELL AS %bcack POET PAINTER COLlabourATIONS

RELIGIOUS BUT BENEATH THAT AND ALMOST CERTAINLY UNINTENTIONALLY THE BROADER QUESTION BEING ASKED IS WHY DO WE ADJECTIVIZE AT ALL HOW DO WE COME TO SAY BAD OF THAT IT IS IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS THAT HE ASKS QUOTE BUT COULD I NOT JUST AS WELL ASK WHEN I SEE SOMEONE KILLED IS IT SIMPLY WHAT I SEE THAT MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON ME OR DOES THIS COME WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOMEONE IS BEING KILLED HERE END QUOTE YOU CAN SEE THAT I LEAVE HIM WITH CREDIT FOR HIS DOUBLE INTERROGATIVE BUT I {can not / cannot} HELP BUT WONDER WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES HIM EXPERIENCE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HE SEES AND WHAT HE

VALENTINE'S POEMS would not BE COMPLETE with out SOME MENTION OF THIS LUSTROUS SOCIETY THAT WE LIVE IN THIS IS CALLED CAPITALISM IN FORM THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE POORER along side THE POORER AVENUES TO THE EAST BUT {that's / that is / that has} o. k. {there's / there is / there has} MORE CHEAP BEER THE DIRT IN THE GLASS LOOKS INHARMONIOUS AND BLEAK SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT THE ADJECTIVES TO ANYONE WHO CAN OR can not SEE IF IT HAS NOT BEEN THE programme THEN IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE EFFECT OF THE WRITING OF THE QURAN BIBLE TORAH AND THEIR NEAR ACCOMPLICES TO LIMIT HUMAN NATURE AND TO DO SO ABSOLUTELY IT HAS SIMILARLY BEEN THE EFFECT OF SECULAR ARE THERE ANY LITERATURES TO REPRESS HUMAN NATURE AND TO HAVE DONE SO BY INSTILLING EXAMPLES OF THOUGHT AND ACTION ALWAYS some how SO MUCH LESS THAN WHAT WE MIGHT ACHIEVE BY APPEARING TO BE EXTERNAL TO {us / u. s.} LITERATURE HAS BEEN A FABRIC OF PEGS AGAINST WHICH WE JOLT OF ARTIFICIAL LIMITS IN THE POST PREHISTORIC PERIOD IN OTHER WORDS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HISTORIC THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A WRITING OF CONTENT AND EVENT OF ACTIONS NATURE IS THE EMBLEM WE WOULD PICK FROM THAT THE CIVILIZATION OF THE LANGUAGES WAS PRIMARILY A PROCESS OF THE OPENING UP OF THEM TO THE LOADS OF THE CONCEPTS OF TIME THE CULMINATED IN THE MYTHS OF ROMANTIC DISILLUSIONMENT A PERIOD WHICH IS JUST NOW FLAPPING ITS FLATULENT LAST INDUSTRY WAS ITS LATEST LARGE MOTIF THE WRITING AND ARTS WHICH ARE NOW STARTING LAPPING THE ROMANTIC AS IT WERE REFLECT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW AGE TO WHICH EVERYTHING WILL BE ABSENT IN WHICH PRETENSE WILL BE THE GENRE OF EVERYTHING INCLUDING DESIRES AGAIN SPACE WILL BE THE FIRST TO EMPTY TIME RIGHT BEHIND {we are / we were} TALKING ABOUT TWO THREE LIFETIMES
DiPalma-Lally-Andrews_Complete-Recording_11-10-77 A a 0.55 342.938 THE BEATS WERE ALMOST ALWAYS SERIOUS TOO I REMEMBER THAT GOT ME INTO THE LITERARY QUARTERLIES AND THROUGH THE X {writer's / writer is / writer has} WORKSHOP AND HELPED ME UNDERSTAND MY OWN DARK CORNERS AND SHARP ANGLES AND THEN ONE DAY I realiseD HOW MUCH OF WHAT I WAS READING AND OFTEN ADMIRING GOING ON AROUND ME IN THE POETRY WORLD WAS A KIND OF PICKING OF SCABS AND FLASHING THE OPEN SORES AND WOUNDS AS BADGES AND CREDENTIALS AND HOW O'HARA TOTALLY SIDESTEPPED THAT CONTEMPORARY TENDENCY BY TONE AND CHOICE OF VOCABULARY THAT CUT THROUGH THE HOPELESSNESS OF SO MUCH POETRY AND REPLACED IT WITH THE JOY OF WRITING A POEM WHAT A SIMPLE BUT WONDERFUL REVELATION THE JOY OF WRITING IT DOWN THAT WAS WHAT X THAT WAS WHAT IT SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE ABOUT IN A WAY THAT MADE ME THINK OF ALL I HAD HEARD THE PAINTERS OF HIS TIME WERE TRYING TO DO GET ACROSS THE ACTION OF THE CREATING RATHER THAN THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SO FINISHED IT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF THE ACTIVITY THE ENERGY AND SPIRIT OF THE ACTUAL WORK THAT WENT INTO IT O'HARA'S POEMS WERE LITTLE EXCURSIONS INTO THE ACT OF WRITING POEMS WITH THE KIND OF mind set THAT KEEPS {us / u. s.} TRYING SEX WITH STRANGERS AGAIN AND AGAIN THE HOPE THAT THIS TIME IS GOING TO BE GREAT GIVE {us / u. s.} MUCH PLEASURE AND SATISFY A LOT OF FRUSTRATION AND TOTALLY ANNUL THE BORING HORRIBLE DEADENING KILLING IN FACT EFFECTS OF LIVING THE MODERN URBAN EXISTENCE I THINK I REWROTE THAT PHRASE BUT I STILL could not RECONCILE THAT ACHIEVEMENT WITH THE PERSONAL REFERENCES THOUGH THEY WERE BECOMING MORE AND MORE FAMILIAR AND THUS LESS AND LESS ELITIST THOUGH STILL SOMEWHAT OBSCURE AND ONE DAY I WAS TEACHING CONTEMPORARY POETRY TO A COLLEGE CLASS AND TALKING ABOUT A POEM OF O'HARA'S I THINK IT WAS A STEP AWAY FROM THEM AFTER TALKING ABOUT THE POEM STEPS AND HOW IT OVERCAME THE SADNESS OF LOVE'S ENDING OR GOING SOUR AMID THE BIG CITY GRIND AND IN DISCUSSING HOW IT DID THIS MOSTLY THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF THE POEM BECAUSE BY THEN {i had / i would} LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MOVEMENT AND RHYTHM AND CONSTRUCTION I COULD SEE HOW WELL MADE O'HARA'S POEMS ARE DESPITE OR MAYBE BECAUSE OF THEIR CONVERSATIONAL FLOW AND IN THE PROCESS OF EXPLAINING WHY THE POEMS WERE GOOD FROM A STRATEGIC AND STRUCTURAL POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE THEY ACCOMPLISHED THIS MESSAGE OF HOPE IN THE FACE OF CONTEMPORARY DESPAIR AND DESPITE WELLFOUNDED REASONS FOR LAMENTING OUR CONDITION OR HIS CONDITION IN THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE POEM AND DID IT THROUGH TECHNICAL AGILITY SO REFINED THE SURFACE AMBIENCE OF EASE AND A KIND OF GLIB GRACE WAS HARDLY DISTURBED SUDDENLY I CAUGHT MYSELF STARTING TO CRY AND I NEVER CRIED BACK THEN IN FACT EXCEPT FOR A SHORT INTERLUDE OF ABOUT A YEAR OF WEEPINESS I NEVER CRIED PERIOD EXCEPT OVER OLD MOVIES OR MUSICALS AND IT WAS THAT HEARTSTRING O'HARA HAD SUDDENLY PLUCKED IN ME THROUGH HIS POETRY THAT SANG SO NATURALLY AND YET SKILLFULLY OF OVERCOMING STUPIDITY AND TEDIOUSNESS OF SO MUCH OF LIFE THE TRUE ROMANTIC ONLY with out THE PRETENTIOUS AND REALLY ELITIST SELFCONSCIOUS AND SELFSATISFIED SERIOUSNESS OF THE WALKING WOUNDS OF CONTEMPORARY POETRY BECAUSE BY MOCKING THE TONE OF THE REAL AND ORIGINAL ROMANTICS PARTLY THROUGH THE USE OF QUOTATION MARKS AND ITALICS WHICH IS A SORT OF WHAT CAMPY DIALOGUE OFTEN DEPENDS ON AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT IT MEANS TALKING IN ITALICS AND EXCLAMATION POINTS AND EXCLAMATIONS OH HE WAS MAKING HIMSELF VULNERABLE TO A X SCALPEL UNLIKE THE CONFESSIONAL POETS AND OTHERS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES EVEN THE SEEMINGLY HONEST BEATS WHO ALWAYS EXPOSED THEMSELVES IN WAYS THAT DEMANDED APPLAUSE OR APPRECIATION FOR THE COURAGE OF THE EXPOSURE OR THE EXTENT OF SELFDESTRUCTION THE EXPOSURE CAUSED OR EXPOSED ET CETERA BUT NOT O'HARA HIS defenceS WERE THE SHREWDEST AND TOUGHEST OF ALL BECAUSE THEY were not DEFENSIVE AT ALL BUT APPEARED TO BE ALL OFFENSIVE ONLY THE OFFENSIVE WAS MOUNTED AGAINST HIS OWN AND OTHERS' DEFENSIVENESS THUS HE COULD BE ATTACKED FOR ELITISM WHEN { he's / he was / he is / he has} IN FACT { he's / he was / he is / he has} OUR MOST DEMOCRATIC POET SINCE WHITMAN BRINGING THAT TRADITION FULL CIRCLE BY REVERSING {whitman's / whitman is / whitman has} POSING AS THE COMMON MAN BROTHER TO ALL WHICH REDUCED every one TO THE LEVEL OF ANONYMITY THAT {whitman's / whitman is / whitman has} POEMS ENSURED WOULD NEVER REALLY BE HIS FATE SO HE COULD AFFORD IT i am TALKING ABOUT THE POSE WHICH PERHAPS BECAME A REALITY MUCH THE WAY GINSBERG SEEMS TO HAVE WHICH IS NOT THE POETRY BECAUSE {whitman's / whitman is / whitman has} POETRY IS OFTEN WONDERFUL AND AMAZING AND VERY MUCH MORE THE SOURCE OF MUCH THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH O'HARA AND THE NEW YORK SCHOOL THAN MANY OF THE FRENCH WRITERS CONSTANTLY ATTRIBUTED WITH HAVING INFLUENCED THE NEW YORK SCENE ALTHOUGH O'HARA IS ALSO SORT OF A BAUDE BAUDELAIREAN REVERSE MAKING THE MOST OF THE WORST OF BAUDELAIRE'S PESSIMISTIC PREDICTIONS ABOUT URBAN EXISTENCE BY PRESERVING THE BEST OF PERCEPTIONS AND EMOTIONALISMS THE CITY SCENE CAN GENERATE BUT INSTEAD O'HARA ELEVATES every one TO THE LEVEL AND ATTENTIVE FAMILIARITY OF STARS THROWING IN THE NAMES OF PERSONAL FRIENDS along side THOSE OF PERSONAL HEROES AND FAMOUS AND WORLDRENOWNED PRODUCERS AND CREATORS OF THE CULTURE THAT HAS COME TO BE OURS AND WHICH HE DEFINED BEFORE MOST OF {us / u. s.} AND WITH THE CLARITY OF THE LYRICS OF A HOLLYWOOD MUSICAL OR A MADISON AVENUE ADD YET WITH ALL THE SUBTLETY AND IMAGINATIVE EXUBERANCE OF A GREAT WIT AND PASSIONATE LOVER WHAT AN INCREDIBLY SEDUCTIVE COMBINATION FOR A POET HIS POEMS ARE SEXY THE LANGUAGE IS OFTEN INTIMATE THE IMAGES VOLUPTUOUS AND OFTEN EXOTIC THE ENERGY SEEMINGLY ENDLESS TO THE POINT USUALLY REASSURING AND FLATTERING WITH JUST ENOUGH ELUSIVE CONNECTIONS TO MAKE {us / u. s.} WANT TO PUT OUT THE TIME AND ENERGY TO MAKE OURSELVES AS ATTRACTIVELY INTELLIGENT AND PERCEPTIVE AND EXPERIENCED AND IN THE KNOW AS THE POEMS ASSUME WE ARE HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT AN AUDIENCE THAT WAS NOT AS GOOD AS HE WAS AND IN THAT WAY INCLUDED {us / u. s.} ALL IN THE COMMUNITY OF FRIENDS HE ADMIRED AND ADDRESSED AND REFERRED TO ALONG WITH THE PROPER NAMES AND FAMILIAR RHYTHMS OF THE MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE AND THINGS ALL OF WHICH HE INCORPORATED INTO DESCRIPTIONS AND NARRATIVES THAT INCLUDED THE PROPER NAMES AND RHYTHMS OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THE REST OF {us / u. s.} ARE ONLY NOW X AFTER THE POEMS WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN GETTING HIP TO AND HOW WELL THEY FIT AND WORK AND COMPLETE THE ARTISTRY OF O'HARA'S GENIUS HE HELPED ME realise THAT THE REASON I WROTE POEMS WAS OFTEN SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RUSH THE FEELING THAT ACCOMPANIED THE WRITING OF THE POEM ESPECIALLY WHEN IT SEEMED TO BE COMING OUT GOOD could not BE DUPLICATED ANYWHERE ELSE IT was not A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANYTHING ELSE GOING TO BED WITH SOMEONE BEAUTIFUL AND TOUGH OR EATING A DELICIOUS AND TOTALLY SATISFYING MEAL OR OUTWITTING A HORRIBLY ABUSIVE COMPETITIVE CREEP IN A CONVERSATION AND IT was not A GRUELING ACT OF ANGUISH AND PAIN GETTING IN TOUCH WITH ALL THE CRABBED SECRETS OF THE PSYCHE AND EXPOSING TO THEM TO THE WELLorganiseD AND SYSTEMATIC SCRUTINY OF SOME POETIC FORM OR STRATEGY NO

SOME NOTES ON MY COLlabourATION WITH C A CONRAD AND THEN WE WILL READ THE POEMS THAT WE WROTE BASED ON THIS SOMATIC EXERCISE CALLED ARTHUR ECHO SOMATIC EXERCISES ARE THIS WONDERFUL FORM THAT CONRAD

WORTH READING AND KEEPING UP WITH ECHO ARTHUR WHILE HOUSESITTING FOR FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA WE COLlabourATED ON THE FOLLOWING SOMATIC EXERCISE PLAYING ARTHUR RUSSELL'S CD WORLD OF ECHO ON REPEAT ON ALL FIVE FLOORS OF THE HOUSE WE MOVE FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR FROM NINE AM TO NINE PM TAKING SCHEDULED BREAKS FOR FOOD CONVERSATION AND CHECKING IN FOR FURTHER FINE TUNING OF THE SOMATIC MANEUVERS BASEMENT

STEREO CARRIES UP TO THE LOFT AT THE END OF THE BED FACING THE WINDOW WHICH LOOKS OVER THE PHILADELPHIA TREETOPS AND SKYLINE THERE ARE TAROT CARDS AND BINOCULARS ON THE BED TO BETTER SEE THE WORLD TAKE MANY NOTES LAST WINTER I HAD THE PLEASURE OF COMPOSING A SOMATIC EXERCISE WITH MY FRIEND C A CONRAD OUR EXERCISE WAS BASED ON DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY CELLIST ARTHUR RUSSELL'S MASTERPIECE WORLD OF ECHO IT IS DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE RUSSELL'S WORLD OF ECHO FOR ANYONE WHO has not HEARD IT BEFORE IT HAS A RARE SPIRITUAL QUALITY WHICH ISSUES FROM RUSSELL'S SONGWRITING VOICE AND CELLO PLAYING BUT ALSO FROM THE PRODUCTION VALUES OF THE ALBUM PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE FROM TIM {lawrence's / lawrence is / lawrence has} BIOGRAPHY OF RUSSELL HOLD ONTO YOUR DREAMS MAKES PALPABLE RUSSELL'S SUBTLE ACCIDENTAL STUDIO PROCESSES DURING THESE SESSIONS IT BECAME STANDARD FOR ARTHUR TO SPLICE TOGETHER SEPARATE TAPES AND HE WOULD REGULARLY GRAB A TRACK FROM ONE TAPE AND FLY IT INTO THE MULTITRACK OF ANOTHER WHILE HIS ONLOOKING ENGINEER TRIED TO STAY CALM QUOTE WE WOULD BE MIXING ON A PIECE OF TAPE AND I WOULD SEE THE SPLICE GO BY RECALLS ERIC LILJESTRAND IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING I COULD NEVER REALLY TELL WHAT WE WERE WORKING ON UNTIL IT WAS DONE UNQUOTE THE GHOSTLY ACCIDENTS THAT AROSE FROM ARTHUR'S INSISTENCE THAT THEY RERECORD OVER OLD TAPE BECAME BECAME AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SONIC FABRIC AT ONE POINT CONRAD TOLD ME THAT HE USED THE ALBUM TO HEAL A KNEE INJURY THAT HE HAD SUFFERED RUSSELL WAS TRAINED FOREMOST AS A MUSICIAN AND ONLY AFTERWARDS AS A BUDDHIST SO THE HEALING POWERS OF HIS MUSIC I CAN ONLY IMAGINE COME FROM THE CONFLUENCE OF THESE TWO DISCIPLINES FOR OUR EXERCISE CONRAD AND I DECIDED TO HAVE RUSSELL'S ALBUM PLAYING ON FOUR DIFFERENT STEREOS THROUGHOUT THE FIVE STORY HOUSE FOR A TWELVE HOUR DURATION TWELVE HOURS IS A LONG TIME TO DO ANYTHING AND ESPECIALLY TO LISTEN TO AN ALBUM TRIPLY ON REPEAT AMONG THE CONSTRAINTS I RECALL IMPOSING ON MYSELF MANY HAD TO DO WITH MEMORY TRYING TO FORGET THE LAST LINE I HAD WRITTEN BEFORE CONTINUING INTERRUPTING MYSELF MID LINE THEN PICKING UP WITH THE LINE AGAIN THESE EXERCISES IN INTENTION AND DISTRACTION I FELT WERE TRUE TO RUSSELL'S MUSIC SO WAS A CERTAIN CIRCULARITY THAT THE EXERCISES WERE TRYING TO INDUCE AMIDST INTERRUPTION AND DISJUNCTION WE ALSO SPENT MUCH OF THE NINE HOURS IMPROVISING LINES WITH A SET OF BOOKS I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME FROM NEW YORK CITY TO PHILADELPHIA MANY OF WHICH WERE OF A WHOLLY METAPHYSICAL OR MEDICAL IMPORT AMONG THESE BOOKS INCLUDED THE WRITINGS OF HENRY CORBIN AND HIS ACOLYTE CHRISTIAN JAMBET OLIVER SACKS'S SEEING VOICES MAURICE MERLEAU PONTY'S SELECTED WRITINGS ON PHENOMENOLOGY A COLLECTION OF GAELIC FOLKTALES AND BALLADS HELLEN KELLER'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY ROBERT KOCH'S RHUBARB AND THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD I ALSO REMEMBER READING A NUMBER OF RECENTLY PUBLISHED POETRY BOOKS INCLUDING JULES BOYKOFF'S COURAGEOUS HEGEMONIC LOVE POTION RUSSELL PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER COMPOSER {i had / i would} COME INTO CONTACT WITH UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF TUNING HIS BODY AND HIS MIND AS INSTRUMENTS COEVAL WITH HIS CELLO AND THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS DRUM MACHINES GUITAR TABLA HE WOULD USE THROUGHOUT HIS COMPOSITIONS VIA STUDIO PRODUCTION RUSSELL GAVE ACCESS TO THE OCCULT AND OTHERWORLDLY IN WAYS SIMILAR TO CONRAD'S USE OF HIS OWN BODY AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND

Drucker-Johanna_02_Complete-Lecture_UPenn_02-14-08 A a 0.042 353.695 X THE PLEASURES OF THE FLASH STILL UNDER CELEBRATED IN OUR CULTURE THEY they have MAPPED THESE FEARS OF SEDUCTION AND PLEASURE ONTO THE TELEVISION THE GAME BO BOY THE VIRTUAL WORLD WITH ITS CONSTANT GRATIFICATIONS I MEAN {it's / it is / it has} NOT THAT THERE are not ISSUES WITH THESE OF THINGS BUT {there's / there is / there has} A KIND OF SENSE THAT OH YOU KNOW we will we will we will PUT DISTANCE IN THERE AND {there's / there is / there has} A KIND OF MORAL SUPERIORITY IN THIS CRITIQUE THAT SUPPOSES THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE DIDACTIC YOU KNOW WE WE SHOULD TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO NOT HAVE PLEASURE WITH MASS CULTURE WHY YOU KNOW THAT {that's / that is / that has} NOT does not GET AT THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IT does not GET AT WHAT IS WHAT IS A PROBLEM HERE SO AND IT TAKES FOR GRANTED THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE {who's / who is / who has} INTELLECTUAL {they are / they were} OUTSIDE THE CULTURE {they are / they were} SUPERIOR TO IT RIGHT ARTISTS ART FOR THEM IS OUTSIDE THE IDEOLOGIES RIGHT RESISTANCE YOU KNOW THE THE RESISTANCE IS OUR JOB YOU KNOW WE ARE THE MORAL CONSCIENCE OF THE CULTURE AND IF YOU CHALLENGE THIS AS I HAVE DONE ON MANY O OCCASIONS AND I I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO PUT FORWARD TO REPLACE RESISTANCE RESISTANCE SAID A CRITIC RECENTLY TO ME WHEN I GAVE A TALK IN NEW YORK RESISTANCE WILL DIE HARD AND HE NARROWED HIS EYES AS HE SAID IT AND HE HUNCHED UP HIS SHOULDERS IN A KIND OF DEFENSIVE WAY AND THEY WERE VERY WELL FED AND VERY WELL PADDED SHOULDERS IN A BUTTER SOFT LAMB LEATHER COAT AND I THOUGH YES RESISTANCE WILL DIE HARD ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE WITH CAREER INVESTMENTS IN ITS STOCK SO AS I WAS WRITING THIS PIECE ALONG CAME A PRESS RELEASE FROM JOY GARNETT AND IT CAME THROUGH THE e. mail AND IT B IT HAD IN IT THIS BRAND NEW PAINTING THAT SHE SENT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS SO WET IT EVEN LOOKED WET ON THE SCREEN IT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF WONDERFUL AND THE PRESS RELEASE SAID JOY GARNETT CONTINUES HER EXPLORATION OF THE MALLEABILITY OF INSTANTLY GLOBALIZED IMAGES SHE SAID SHE CULLS THEM AND SHE ARCHIVES THEM SO THAT THEIR CONTEXT EVAPORATES AND I THOUGHT YES THIS IS SO INTERESTING { she's / she was / she is / she has} LIKE DOING THIS YOU KNOW REMEDIATION PROJECT AND JUST WORKING WITH THESE IMAGES AND IT FELT SO MUCH TO ME LIKE THE IMAGES IN MY BOOK OF OF REAL THINGS OF THINGS A {person's / person is / person has} OBSER OBSERVED OR PHOTOGRAPHS AND {they are / they were} SO STRIKING THAT THEY SORT OF STOP YOUR DAY AND I COULD TELL SHE WAS HAVING THAT SAME EXPERIENCE AND THAT THESE THINGS JUST COME OUT DURING IT STOPS HER AND SHE THINKS WHAT AN AMAZING IMAGE BUT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMAGE SHE HAS TO REMAKE IT SHE HAS TO REPAINT IT SO AGAIN I KNOW THAT EXPERIENCE I SIT DOWN I SIT DOWN WITH IMAGES THAT COME FROM THE CULTURE AND I WANT TO DRAW THEM AGAIN SO WHY IS THAT WHAT IS THAT DOING WHAT IS JOY WHAT IS JOY DOING SHE ABSORBS I ABSORB WE PROCESS WE REMAKE THESE THINGS WE EXPERIENCE THE IMAGES ANEW SO {they are / they were} OUTSIDE ME THIS IS NOT OUTSIDE HER {they are / they were} GRAFTED {they are / they were} SCRAPED FROM THAT SURFACE YOU KNOW YOU REALLY KIND OF THROUGH THAT PHYSICAL ACT OF MAKING YOU YOU INTERPRET SOMETHING AND YOU SOMATICIZE IT IT BECOMES PART OF YOU AND {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF SEEING THROUGH THE HAND AND SEEING THROUGH THE BODY THAT GOES ALONG SO WHERE DOES JOY GARNETT GET HER IDEA OF WHAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DOING I MEAN WHAT DOES SHE THINK { she's / she was / she is / she has} DOING WHAT WHAT IS HER IDEA OF MAKING ART WHAT IS IT TO MAKE YOU KNOW POETRY AND TEXT INTO A BOOK WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO CREATE EX AESTHETIC EXPRESSIONS AM I REALLY DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT ANYTHING MORE SELF CONSCIOUS THAN I WAS WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE DIGGING TO CHINA DO I KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT MAKING ART THAN I DO ABOUT MAK ABOUT DIGGING A HOLE i am NOT REALLY SURE I THINK CULTURAL MYTHOLOGY INVENTS ITSELF IN {us / u. s.} ANEW OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN EACH GENERATION BUT let us MAKE A COMPARISON HERE let us let us COMPARE JOY GARNETT WITH DAMIEN HEARST RIGHT I MEAN WHAT MAKES ART DIFFERENT FROM OTHER MADE THINGS HOW DO WE KNOW {we are / we were} LOOKING AT ART AND NOT JUST AT SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW {here's / here is / here has} THE CONSUMERIST ISSUE IT COMES RIGHT TO THE FORE HERE YOU KNOW THIS IS THE HIGH STAKES GAMBLE THIS IS HIGH PRICED ART THIS IS KITSCH VULGAR IMAGERY YOU KNOW THIS IS THE INVESTMENT IN BRANDING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD RIGHT WHAT GOD MAMMON IS THIS AN OUTRAGE OR IS IT ACTUALLY THE WORK THAT DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITAL AND ART IN ORDER TO KEEP ITS STATUS I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AND SERIOUS WORK AND I THINK IT TELLS {us / u. s.} A LOT I do not THINK YOU CAN BRACKET IT OUT QUITE THE CONTRARY THIS IS THE HIGH MOST HIGHLY PRIZED WORK BY A CONTEMPORARY ARTIST EVEN IF { he's / he was / he is / he has} THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT IT FROM HIMSELF IN PART THE POINT IS THAT IT TELLS {us / u. s.} SOMETHING TELL {us / u. s.} TO GOD {there's / there is / there has} SOMETHING VERY VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF HOW ART AS A CONCEPT IS CONSTRUCTING ITSELF CULTURALLY HOW ABOUT MURRA CULMNEY ANOTHER AR I LOVE THIS GUY I THINK THIS STUFF IS AMAZING OR IS HE JUST A PRODUCT DESIGNER RIGHT IS THIS ART OR PRODUCT THIS IS CRAZED IMAGERY DEVIANT BUT IT FINDS ITS MARK INTO ALL KINDS OF PRODUCTS {it's / it is / it has} A BIT IS THIS AN OUTRAGE RIGHT IS THIS ART IS THIS IS THIS COMMERCE OR IS IT THE DEMONSTRATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MARKETING AND PROMOTION IN THE PRODUCTION OF NOT JUST ART BUT THE CATEGORY OR ART AGAIN WHAT IS ART THAT {we are / we were} DOING IT OR PHIL COLLINS THIS IS YOU KNOW FROM THE THE VIDEO INSTALLATION THE WORLD will not LISTEN {it's / it is / it has} A WONDERFUL INSTALLATI {it's / it is / it has} SEDUCTIVE {it's / it is / it has} BEAUTIFUL YOU KNOW PHIL COLLINS IS A SMITHS FAN HE SET UP THIS PROJECT TO GO TO THREE CITIES BOGOTA ISTANBUL AND JAKARTA AND HE GATHERED FANS OF THE SMITHS ALL AGES IN THOSE CITIES HE SET UP KARAOKE PERFORMANCES AND HE FIL FILMED THEM AND THEN HE INSTALLED THEM IN THIS BEAUTIFUL VIDEO INSTALLATION WHERE YOU SEE THE THREE CITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY SIDE BY SIDE GOING THROUGH THE CUTS ON THE SMITHS' ALBUM AND WHAT DO THEY SHOW YOU THESE WONDERFUL FIGURES THEY SHOW IMPOSSIBILITIES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF OF EVER BECOMING WHAT YOU ASPIRE TO

FITFULLY THE DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE AND STRIKES HER BREAST IN PASS PASSIONATE FRUSTRATION WHEN THERE IS NO WORD AT HER TONGUE'S TIP some timeS WHOLE SENTENCES WILL COME some timeS EVERYTHING BUT THE KEY WORD SO IT IS I WANT BUT ONE CAN NEVER TELL WHAT IT IS SHE WANTS DOVE MOTHER OF MOUTHINGS THE GRAY DOVES IN YOUR MANY BRANCHES CODE AND DECODE WHAT WARNINGS WE CAN RECALL OF LOVED WATERY TONES SHE RAISES THE BEDROOM WINDOW TO LET IN THE AIR AND PEARL GRAY LIGHT OF MORNING WHERE THE FIRST WORLD STRIPPED OF ITS NAMES EXTENDS WHERE INITIAL THINGS GO BECKONING DOVES SOUNDS RECUR TAKING WHAT WE KNOW OF THEM WHEN THE SOUL LEAPS TO THE TONGUE'S TIP AS IF TO TELL WHAT SECRET IN THE WORD FORT THE BIRD'S CLAW SCRAPING THE LEDGES I HEAR THE RUSTLING OF WINGS IS IT EVENING THE WOODWINDS CHORTLING A PIPING SOUND SETTLING DOWN IN THE DARK PIT WHERE THE ORCHESTRA LIGHTS GLOW AS THE CURTAIN RISES AND IN THE LIVING ROOM AT ANOTHER STAGE LAMPS ARE LIT THE LADY IN THE SHADE IS ABOUT HELD IN DOVES IN HER TWO HANDS LET IT FLY UP FROM THE BOWL SHE MADE AS IF A WORD HAD LEFT HER LIPS NOW THAT THE SONG HAS FLOWN THE TREE SHAPES RUSTLING IN THE WIND WITH NO STARS OF ITS OWN FOR ALL THE NETS OF WORDS ARE GONE THE LADY HOLDS NOTHING IN HER TWO HANDS TOP THE CATCHES OF THE EARS ARE TORN AND THE WOOD LIGHT FLOODS AND OVERFLOWS THE BOWL SHE HOLDS LIKE A QUESTION VOICES OF CHILDREN FROM PLAYGROUNDS COME SOUNDING ON THE WIND with out NAMES WE can not TELL WHO THEY ARE THERE WE WERE ONCE TOO UNDER WHAT STAR BEFORE WORDS AFTERWARDS HANDS LIFTED TO THE BOWL FOR WATER ARMS TO PRAYER FOR WHAT WE HEARD WAS NO MORE THAN A DOVE WHERE THE DAY SLEPT AFTERNOON AND THE LIGHTS BLUR AND STRAYED THE QUEEN OF THE TREES TALKING HEARS ONLY THE LEAF SOUND OF WINGS IN THE BOUGH THE VOICES IN THE WIND VERGING INTO LEAF SOUND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT MY HEART HAD SUCH A BURDEN OR NEEDED A BURDEN IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING TAKE WHAT MASKS DEFINE WORDS AND AS AN OLD MAN COME FORWARD INTO A SPEECH HE HAD LONG WAITED FOR HAD ON THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE FROM WHICH NOW OH FATEFUL THREAD SENSITIVE TO MY SONG MOST MOVED NOW FROM YOUR COURSES THE FLAME HAD FLED MAKING BUT WORDS OF WHAT I LOVED GOING TO READ NOW THIS I I {can not / cannot} FIND JUST A BREATH FORM I have not WORKED ON AND SO IT will not GOT BEAT AND AND ANYWAY THIS FORM IS IS INTENDED AS SEQUENCES OF LIGHT i have i have BEEN MORE AND AND AND I WENT THROUGH A PERIOD WHICH I REACTED AGAINST THE CANTOS BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT POUND IS ALWAYS I I AFTER ALL WE HAD NO OTHER POEMS BUT THE CANTOS SINCE POUND BEGAN ON THE CANTOS i have MANY DIFFERENT FASCINATIONS WITH THE CANTOS they have ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIAL I BEGAN WITH THE CANTOS AT ABOUT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN AND AND ALL MY LIFE HAVE HAD MANY DIFFERENT IDEAS OF THEM NOW RECENTLY i have BEEN HAUNTED BY THEM AGAIN AND THEY SEEM TO ME THIS TIME TO OPEN UP A GREAT FREEDOM A A AND THAT IS A FREEDOM IN THE RELATION TO THE WAY IN WHICH I COMPOSE THINGS THEMATICALLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND AND AND I THOUGHT IF I WERE TO OPEN UP let us SAY JUST CALL SOMETHING JUST PASSAGES AS YOU MIGHT CALL SOMETHING JUST FRAGMENTS TRY TO PREVENT IT FROM FORMING INTO A POEM AND {it's / it is / it has} A PINDAR POEM OR APPREHENSION FORMED INTO A TURTLE {that's / that is / that has} SYMPHONIC THE SYMPHONIC FORM OR OR THE SONATA FORM FASCINATED ME THEY I LIKE TO ORCHESTRATE A LARGE FORM I LIKE TO HAVE RELATED MOVEMENTS AND AND AND BOXE POEMS WITHIN POEMS A AN AND NOW I WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD LET THAT LOOSE NOW OF COURSE I {can not / cannot} DO IT IMMEDIATELY you will FIND THEMATIC PROGRESSIONS IN THIS BUT BUT I HAVE BEGUN THIS POEM IN ORDER TO SEE IF I CAN IF I CAN OPEN UP AND EVENTUALLY HAVE SOME OF THESE PASSAGES MUCH MORE FREE OF IT I NOW THERE IS A KIND OF POEM THAT I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE BEEN ABLE TO DO AND AND AND THAT REALLY FASCINATES ME A TOTAL FORM WITH WITH THE I IS SPRI {it's / it is / it has} JUST WILLIAMS' SPRING AND ALL AND I SEE THE LATER WILLIAMS IS VERY MUCH WHAT I DO DO ALL THE LATER WILLIAMS IS THEMATICALLY COMPOSED AND AND AND AND AND AND AND HAS A TH REGULAR MUSICAL PROGRESSION BUT IN SPRING AND ALL THERE THERE I THERE IS A SEQUENCE OF I do not KNOW WHAT IS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY TWO POEMS {it's / it is / it has} MUCH MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER COMPOSE EXCEPT BY YOUR INTUITION SO WHAT {that's / that is / that has} WHAT i am SORT OF GOING TOWARD AND YET CERTAINLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS POEM YOU YOU will not FIND AN OPENING YET i am GOING TO READ AS FAR AS AS AS I HAVE TYPED AND AND BECAUSE this will BE THE FIRST TIME i have READ THESE IN PUBLIC THIS IS THE FIRST TIME BY THE WAY i have READ THAT H D POEM IN PUBLIC AND AND SO THE PREVIOUS TIME I WAS CERTAINLY was not READY FOR IT I was not QUITE READY THIS TIME THAT I I {can not / cannot} GET {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THE FEW POEMS THAT I {can not / cannot} GET MY DISTANCE FROM I AM FOR ME THE POEM IS A DISTANCE NOT A NOT AN A A FEELING I MEAN THAT BUT MY FEELING IS SO MIXED UP WITH THE FEELING OF THE POEM IS THE WAY I PUT IT I KNOW THE DISTANCE IS THERE IN THE POEM
Duncan-Robert_Complete-Recording_Lecture-On-Dickinson_New-College_6-23-81 A a 0.205 406.897 BUT BUT BUT SHE I THINK THAT YOU THAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} DESIGNEDLY IN A WAY WANTING TO BE THERE WELL WH WH BUT AND AND LAYING CLAIM {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE YOU BEGAN THE EUPHERIES BECAUSE YOU realiseD {it's / it is / it has} SOMETHING YOU LAID ON YOU BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} NOT COMING FROM THIS BUT BUT THAT THAT SO HER GNOMIC WILL BE NOW I KNOW MORE THAN YOU DO YOU LITTLE TWERP AND AND THE AND THE RUNE WILL BE I MEAN AND AND GNOMIC IN EMILY DICKINSON DOES NOT MEAN SHE KNOWS SOMETHING IT MEANS SOMETHING ALSO IT NO THE THE LANGUAGE KNOWS SOMETHING { she's / she was / she is / she has} NOT GOING TO I MEAN THIS IS THE WAY I I do not SHE KNO SHE KNOWS PLENTY BUT {that's / that is / that has} NOT WHAT {we are / we were} ENC ENC ENCOUNTERED {that's / that is / that has} SO STRANGE NOR WHAT SHE ENCOUNTERS she will GO INTO SPEAK FROM SOMETHING SHE KNOWS BUT TO BRING {us / u. s.} CLEARLY TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ARE AT THE RUNE AND THEN THE AND RUNE IS TO EVOKE RUNIC GNOMIC IS SOME UTTERANCE THAT THAT THAT I IS VERY CLOSE TO ENIGMA AND I IS DIFFERENT FROM S SYMBOL ENI ENIGMA IS SOMETHING THAT can not BE TRANSFERRED INTO METAPHOR SO i am TALKING ABOUT THE METAPHORIC HERE IN GOOD DEGREE WHEN I GO THROUGH THESE THEMES THAT ARE CONSTANTLY OPERATING IN METAPHOR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DRAWS HER TO HIM IS THAT SHE ALSO EXPERIENCES HIM AS E ENIGMATIC THEY REARRIVE AND AND REFUSE A AS I SAI SO {we are / we were} IN THE PRESENCE OF A NO A A A METAPHOR THAT {can not / cannot} BE LOCATED THAT WE BEGIN TO realise IS METAPHORICAL BECAUSE IT HAS NO LOCATION AND MEANWHILE THERE IS AN ENI AN ABSOLUTELY GNAWING ANNOYING A A A A NECESSITY FOR A LOCATION SOMEWHERE SO PLACE THE UNLOO HAS A LOT AND V IS VERY TELLING HERE THE SEA FOR INSTANCE AND OVER BEYOND THERE IN HORIZON AND BEYOND HORIZON ARE ARE NOT GLOBAL AS THEY ARE IN IN IN IN WHITMAN ALTHOUGH { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOT EXPERIEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} I THINK IN THE EARLY POEM SHE HAS SHE HAS SEVERAL REFERENCES COLUMBUS ENCIRCLING SEA ENCIRCLING THE GLOBE AS SUCH GLOBE IS THERE IN HER MIND BUT NOT NOT WHEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOING OVER THERE NOT WHEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOING TO ANOTHER LAND OR ANOTHER PLACE WELL THIS ONE LITTLE POEM IS NOT ONLY WHAT I W WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT IN THE WAY OF THOUGH OF HER STRIKING THE GNOMIC AND THE RUNE BOTH GO BY BEING VERY STRIKING AND SHE BEGINS TO HAVE A LANGUAGE WHICH IS D LIKE SPENCER'S ABSOLUTELY J HER SHE HAS A TENSE THAT LOOKS SUBJUNCTIVE YEAH we will FIND THAT AND THEN SHE ALSO WILL WILL STRIKE OUT ON HER OWN FO FOR THE SERPENT'S FIGURE GLID STEALTHILY ALONG NO ACCIDENT AT ALL i have GOT I THINK TWO VERSIONS OF THIS THERE THERE IT IS FEATURED TERMS ARE THEMSELVES TERMS STANDING NOT SYMBOLS STANDING FOR SOMETHING THAT COMES IMMEDIATELY INTO QUESTION ON AND AND AND AND OPENLY INTO QUESTION WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BUT NOW RUNE IS THE ONE THAT EVOKES THIS RUNE EVOKES WH WH WHERE WHERE GNO GNOMIC'S A GNOMIC COVERS IN SOME WAY OR OR {it's / it is / it has} LIKE A HUSK OF SOMETHING THAT YOU {can not / cannot} GET AT RUNE IS TO CALL UP THE THE THE THING IS VIS VISITATION TO ENCOUNT TO CALL UP THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE THING AN AND THAT IS VERY FREQUENT MODE THESE ARE THE MODES IN EMILY DICKINSON YOU FIND PRAYER CERTAINLY IN IN IN THE TERROR AND AND AND I MEAN ALL HER LIFE SHE INHABITED A A REALM IN POETRY THAT NEEDS PRAYER SO we will FIND PRAYER AN AND AN AN AND AND AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT {that's / that is / that has} WHERE SHE IS MYSTIC A CERTAINTY THAT {she had / she would} GOT TO DWELL THERE BUT THIS ONE LITTLE POEM IS E JUST AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THIS KIND FOLLOWING THAT ONE IN NUMBER TEN IS IS JUST ITS OPENING LINES MY WHEEL IS IN THE DARK I can not SEE A SPOKE YET KNOW ITS DRIPPING FEET GO ROUND AND ROUND MY FOOT IS ON THE TIDE AN UNFREQUENTED ROAD YET HAVE ALL ROADS A CLEARING AT THE END ONE HAS RESIGNED THE LOOM SOME HAVE RESIGNED THE LOOM SOME IN THE BUSY TOMB FIND QUAINT EMPLOY SOME WITH NEW STATELY FEET PASS ROYAL THROUGH THE GATE FLINGING THE PROBLEM BACK AT YOU AND I NOW {that's / that is / that has} AGAIN THIS AT YOU AND I THIS THIS THIS I IS STRIKING ENOUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TITLES OF HER POEMS I MEAN I THE THE THE AN AN AND AND SO { she's / she was / she is / she has} THE OTHER END OF IF IF P REALI THINK HOW NEAR SHE IS TO DEBBIE WHO did not WANT THE I THERE SO THE I MUST BE REMEMBERED ALL THE TIME AND IT MUST BE REMEMBERED ALL THE TIME AT THE COST OF SAYING AT YOU AND I SHE IN IN IN BACK TO HER LETTER TO HIGGINSON I I did not GO TO SHE WENT TO SCHOOLS all right BUT IN THE SENSE YOU MEA I MEAN IN A SENSE NO MATTER WHAT SCHOOL SHE WENT TO THE POEM SO INVADE EVERY LEVEL THAT THAT SHE IS NOT MAKING MISTAKE WHEN AT YOU AND I BECAUSE I IS THE NAME OF A PERSON THIS IS THAT WAS SUSAN OBSERVES A ME IS MARK LIKELY TO BE THE ONE YOU HEARD THAT OTHER BOOK PEOPLE THE I NEVER BELONGED TO YOU NOW I NOW ONLY BY VISITATION DOES I HAVE WE GOT A CAR AGAIN PARKED AROUND o. k. NOW I NEED TO GET TO CHEMISTRY CLASSES CLASSES SORRY OH %bcack AND AND AND AND THE AND AND THIS IS THI EVERYBODY HAS FACES RIGHT THEY do not DREAM THAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} NOT I MEAN SHE SHE does not LEAVE YOU ROOM TO THINK OH { she's / she was / she is / she has} MADE A SLIP OR SHE DID OR OR FOR INSTANCE DID SHE DO IT DID SHE DO IT FOR RHYME THERE CANTER AND we will TAKE TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THAT WAS NUMBER TEN WAS IT YES NO NO WAY MMMM NO WAY ABSOLUTELY JUST I EXCLAMATION POINT I IN CASE YOU MISSED THE THE YOU AND I WELL ACTUALLY SHE MIGHT BE RHYMING IT WITH EMPLOY OR SHE DOES IT WAS HER LINE %bcack I BUT ME would have BEEN AN ABSOLUTE RHYME FOR EMPLOY AND I IS A VERY JARRING ONE INDEED SHE LIKES JARRING RHYMES BUT ME would have BEEN A A I MEAN NOT W ME would have BEEN VERY TYPICAL OF HER EMPLOY AND WE KNOW { she's / she was / she is / she has} {it's / it is / it has} I IS THE NAME OF SOMEBODY BECAUSE ME IS THE NAME OF SOMEBODY TOO FOR HER NOW {it's / it is / it has} SO HER SHIFTERS ARE RE ARE REAL PERSONS WITHIN THE POETRY THIS IS WHAT i have BEEN I GET AT AN AND AND I do not MEAN THAT SHE THOUGHT A HEAVY TRIP AROUND BUT SHE must have recogniseD WHAT SHE WAS DOING AT YOU AND I

Fiedler_Layton_Ginsberg_DeLoach_Complete-Recording_Allentown-Community-Center-Buffalo_10-06-78 A a 8.762 403.619 i am GOING TO READ JUST ONE POEM FOR MY SECOND TIME AROUND {it's / it is / it has} A LONG POEM WHICH IS TO SAY A LONG POEM FOR ME A LONGISH POEM FOR A LONG TIME WHAT I WANTED TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS TO GET POEMS SHORTER AND SHORTER AND SHORTER AND THEN I DISCOVERED I WAS TOO SUCCESSFUL I STOPPED WRITING COMPLETELY AND SILENCE WAS GREAT BUT I was not HAPPY WITH IT THIS IS THE NEWEST POEM I HAVE WRITTEN {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} A POEM WHICH I WRESTLED WITH FOR A LONG TIME AND PUT AWAY UNTOUCHED AND THEN I WAS ASKED VERY RECENTLY IF I WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A BOOK INTENDED PRIMARILY FOR CHILDREN AND THIS SENT ME BACK TO THIS POEM AGAIN WHICH IS A FAIRY TALE POEM THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW ME AT ALL KNOW THAT ONE OF THE OVERWHELMING INTERESTS OF MY LIFE IS FAIRY TALES AND FOR MANY YEARS I TRIED TO TURN MY favourITE HORRIFIC FAIRY TALE WHICH IS CALLED THE JUNIPER TREE INTO VERSE I WAS TOTALLY UNSUCCESSFUL AT DOING THIS AND i have ENDED UP DOING A B A A FAIRY FROM AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT TRADITION i am HAPPY THAT I HAVE SOME JAPANESE FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS POEM IS IN FACT A POEM BASED ON AN OLD JAPANESE FAIRY TALE WHICH IS CALLED MOMOTARO OR THE PEACH BOY I do not KNOW WHETHER ANY OF YOU HERE KNOW IT OR MANY OF YOU HERE KNOW IT BUT IT IS A POEM WHICH ALWAYS DEEPLY MOVED ME ONCE MANY YEARS AGO I WAS SET TO LEARNING JAPANESE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY AS A MATTER OF FACT AND THE ONLY THING I READ OF ALL THE MATERIAL THAT WE WENT THROUGH IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING JAPANESE THAT EVER STAYED IN MY HEAD WAS THIS STORY I COULD STILL HEAR IT GOING IN MY HEAD FOR INSTANCE THE NOISE THAT THE PEACH OUT OF WHICH THE LITTLE BOY COMES MAKES AS IT TURNS OVER AND OVER IN THE RIVER DONBURI DONBURI DONBURI I CAN HEAR THE {boy's / boy is / boy has} MOTHER TALKING TO HIM AS SHE LOADS HIM UP WITH KIBI DANGO MILLET SEED CAKES THE BEST KIBI DANGO IN ALL JAPAN AND I CAN HEAR THE ANIMALS WHO STOPPED HIM i have FORGOTTEN ALL THE MILITARY JAPANESE I EVER KNEW I {can not / cannot} TELL YOU THE WORD FOR A BATTLESHIP OR A GUN OR AN EMPLACEMENT OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT I CAN T PROBABLY TELL YOU THIS STORY IN JAPANESE THOUGH ALL THE REST OF IT IS DEPARTED FROM ME AND {i had / i would} WANTED TO WORK IT AND REWORK IT AND i have TRIED TRIED TO FIND A FORM FOR IT AND IT FINALLY OCCURRED TO ME AS I UNDER WITH THIS SIC YOU SEE {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A LONG {it's / it is / it has} ONLY ONE POEM i am GOING TO READ SO I HAVE AN EXCUSE FOR A LONG INTRODUCTION RIGHT AS I THOUGHT ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE FORM FOR THIS POEM I DECIDED I WOULD RETURN TO A VERY ANCIENT AND honourable FORM VERY FLEXIBLE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL DOGGEREL THIS IS A POEM WHICH IS WRITTEN IN DOGGEREL I DEARLY LOVE A RHYME i will DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD FOR A RHYME AND I do not MUCH CARE HOW FAST OR HOW SLOW I GET TO IT IN THE LINE THE INTERESTING THING WHICH HAPPENED TO THIS STORY WHICH ORIGINALLY HAD A HAPPY ENDING PEACH BOY GOES OUT AND HE GOES TO THE ONIGASHIMA THE ISLAND OF THE DEVILS AND HE CONQUERS THE KING OF THE DEMONS DEVILS what ever YOU CALL THEM MONSTERS AND HE COMES BACK HOME MAKES HIS FAMILY HAPPY AND HE LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER BUT AS I WROTE THIS POEM I DISCOVERED THAT THE ENDING OF IT INSISTED ON CHANGING AND I could not FINISH IT UNTIL I CHANGED THE ENDING AND THIS FINALLY TURNED OUT THEN TO BE A POEM NOT ONLY ABOUT WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT WHICH IS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF FINDING A PROPER NAME FOR EVERYTHING ANYTHING THIS IS A POEM ABOUT NAMING BUT IT ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE A POEM ABOUT HEROISM AN ANTIHEROIC POEM AND I SUPPOSE THE REASON IT BECAME AN ANTIHEROIC POEM IS BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE WHICH I LEARNED READING THE STORY OF THE LITTLE PEACH BOY I ENDED UP USING ON THE ISLAND OF IWO JIMA AND TOO MANY BAD CONNOTATIONS ARE CONNECTED WITH IT ANYHOW I THINK ALL CHILDREN ALWAYS KNOW THAT THE SO CALLED HAPPY ENDINGS OF FAIRY TALES ARE LIES RIGHT BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT {we are / we were} COURTEOUS ENOUGH TO LIE TO THEM AND PRETEND THAT WE THINK THEY BELIEVE

STONE IN THE BLACK MIRROR A {woman's / woman is / woman has} TRYING TO ERASE NAMES NO { she's / she was / she is / she has} BRUSHING A {boy's / boy is / boy has} HAIR I SHOULD SAY THAT IT TOOK ME FOURTEEN YEARS TO WRITE ABOUT THE viet nam EXPERIENCE AND AT THE TIME I WAS RENOVATING A HOUSE IN NEW ORLEANS AND THAT PRETTY MUCH PROMPTED THE MOMENT TO WRITE ABOUT viet nam I HAD VERY SYSTEMATICALLY WRITTEN AROUND THAT EXPERIENCE WELL {here's / here is / here has} A POEM ABOUT {that's / that is / that has} A BIT MORE PERSONAL {it's / it is / it has} ABOUT SOMETHING i have ACTUALLY HAD QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE WRITING ABOUT WHICH IS THE DEATH OF MY FATHER WHO PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND AS ANYONE KNOWS WHO HAS LOST A PARENT AND CERTAINLY LOST A PARENT AT A BIT OF A YOUNGER AGE THERE IS THIS I IN A WAY OF COURSE {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} AN INCREDIBLE TRAGEDY BUT {there's / there is / there has} THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT COME WITH IT AND I GUESS AS I GREW OLDER I FELT A STRANGE SENSE OF ALMOST SPECIALNESS FOR HAVING SORT OF SURVIVED THIS THING I IN IN MY teen age YEARS AND I OFTEN HAVE REFLECTED ON IT AS i have GROWN OLDER THAT ONE FEELS THE SADNESS AND THE GUILT BUT ANOTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS THE SENSE OF HAVING BEEN SINGLED OUT AND HAVING BEEN MADE SPECIAL BY HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE AND I TRIED TO CAPTURE THAT I do not KNOW IF I HAVE BUT THIS POEM IS CALLED SHE THINKS OF HIM ON HER BIRTHDAY {it's / it is / it has} STILL WINTER AND STILL I do not KNOW YOU any more AND YOU do not KNOW ME BUT THIS MORNING I STAND IN THE KITCHEN WITH THE ILLUSION PEELING A CLEMENTINE EACH PIECE SNAPS LIKE THE NICKNAME FOR A GIRL THE TINNY BITE IT WAS TO BE ONE ONCE AGAIN I COUNT YOUR DAUGHTERS AND FIND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE THE WAIST OF THE HOURGLASS ENDLESSLY PASSED THROUGH AND PASSED THROUGH BUT HOLDING NOTHING DISMAYED BY THE GRUBBY FEBRUARY SUN I WAS BORN UNDER AND THE CHEAP PLEASURE IT GIVES THE WINDOW YET I RAISE THE SHADE FOR IT AND TRY NOT TO FEEL IT IS WRONG TO WANT SPRING TO BE A SEASON FURTHER FROM YOU NOT WRONG TO WISH FOR A HARD RAIN A HARD WIND LIKE ONE WE SAT OUT IN TOGETHER OR CAME IN FROM TOGETHER {here's / here is / here has} A POEM ABOUT A SITUATION WHICH I IS PROBABLY FAMILIAR TO MANY WORKING PEOPLE AND THIS ONE IS PARTICULARLY ABOUT WORKING WOMEN AND THE WAY THAT WE DRAG OURSELVES THROUGH THE DAY AT TIMES some timeS INSPIRED some timeS EXHAUSTED AND I THINK THERE IS A PARTICULAR SADNESS OF A WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE WHEN SHE BEGINS TO realise WHAT { she's / she was / she is / she has} BEEN DOING WITH HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HOPING FOR SOMETHING MORE WORKS LATE ON A TUESDAY NIGHT AGAIN mid town IS BLASTED OUT AND SILENT DRAINED OF THE CROWD AND ITS DOGGY DAY I TRAMPLE THE SCRAPS OF DELI LUNCHES SOME ATE OUTDOORS AS THEY STARED DUMBLY OR HOOTED AT {us / u. s.} CAREER GIRLS THE HAGGARD BEAUTIES THE VIVID CAN DOS OPEN RAINCOATS A FLAP IN THE MARCH WIND AS WE CROSSED TO AND FRO IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC

SEE THE GOOD SCHOOLGIRL TURNS THIRTY FORTY SINGING THE SONG OF TIME MANAGEMENT ALL DAY LONG LUGGING THE BRIEFCASE HOME SO AT TEN PM {you are / you were} STANDING HERE WITH YOUR HAND IN THE AIR COLD BUT TOO STUBBORN TO REACH INTO YOUR POCKET FOR A GLOVE CURSING THE FREEZING RAIN AS THOUGH IT WERE YOUR DIFFICULTY {it's / it is / it has} PATHETIC AND {nobody's / nobody is / nobody has} FAULT BUT YOUR OWN NOW THE TEARS DOWN INTO THE COLLAR CABS CABS BUT NONE FOR HIRE I have not HAD DINNER i am NOT HALF OF WHAT i am MEANT TO BE AMONG OTHER THINGS THE MOTHER OF THREE TOO TIRED TONIGHT TO SEDUCE THE FATHER THE NEXT POEM i am GOING TO READ IS A POEM ENTITLED THE DECK AND AND I THINK THE POEM SORT OF EMBRACES THAT MOMENT WHEN I realise SOMETHING THAT TAUGHT ME A GREAT DEAL THE DECK I HAVE ALMOST NAILED MY LEFT THUMB TO THE TWO BY FOUR BRACE THAT HOLDS THE DECK TOGETHER THE SATURDAY MORNING IN JUNE i have SAWED TWO BY SIXES T SQUARED LEATHERED EVERYTHING THE THREE BUBBLES SEAL IN GREEN GLASS AND ON THE SWEAT ON MY TONGUE TASTE IS LIKE WHAT I AM I KNOW i am ALONE USING LEVERAGE TO SWING THE LONG BOARDS INTO PLACE BUT AT TIMES IT SEEMS AS IF THERE ARE TWO OF {us / u. s.} WORKING SIDE BY SIDE LIKE OLD LOVERS GUESSING EACH OTHERS MOVES THIS HAMMER IS THE ONLY THING I OWNED OF YOURS AND IT MAKES ME FEEL AS IF i have CARPENTERED FOR YEARS EVEN THE CROOKED NAILS HAVE GONE IN STRAIGHT THE HANDSAW GLIDES THROUGH GREASE THE TOENAIL STUDS HOLE THE DECK HAS RISEN UP AROUND ME AND NOW {it's / it is / it has} STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT MY WEIGHT TO NOT SWAY WITH THIS OLD SILLY WRONG FOOTED DANCE i am ABOUT TO THROW MY WHOLE BODY INTO PLUMBED FROM SKY TO GROUND THIS {morning's / morning is / morning has} WORK CAN TAKE NEARLY ANYTHING WITH SO MUCH UPROAR PUNISHMENT FOOTWORK AND EUPHORIA i am ALMOST HAPPY THIS SATURDAY I WALK BACK INSIDE AND HERE YOU ARE PLANED AND SIMPLE AS AS THE SUNLIGHT ON THE TOOLS OUTSIDE DADDY IF {you had / you would} COME BACK A WEEK AGO A DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I would have BEEN READY TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A LONG TALK WITH YOU THERE WERE THINGS I WANTED TO SAY SO MANY QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK BUT they have BEEN ANSWERED WITH AS MUCH SALT AND TRUTH AS WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE LIVING {i had / i would} LIKE TO READ A POEM CALLED AN IDLE THOUGHT WHICH IS THE KIND OF DAYDREAM OF A WOMAN {who's / who is / who has} MARRIED AT TWENTY ONE WHICH I WAS AND OCCASIONALLY HER HER MIND WANDERS OFF TO OTHER PASSIONS SHE MAY HAVE KNOWN AND {i had / i would} LIKE TO PREFACE THIS BY SAYING THAT THE POEM WAS WRITTEN WELL BEFORE MONICA LEWINSKY EVER APPEARED ON THE SCENE SO i am NOW some timeS EMBARRASSED BY IT BECAUSE IT IT CONTAINS A FANTASY OF SEDUCING THE PRESIDENT WHICH HAS IN OUR COUNTRY THIS THAT SUBJECT HAS PLAYED OUT IN A VERY SILLY WAY BUT IT ALSO CONTAINS A BRITISH CHARACTER WHO LISTENERS HERE MAY KNOW SO I do not KNOW IF PEOPLE WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THIS PERSON IS IS OF SOME SEX APPEAL AN IDLE THOUGHT i am NEVER GOING TO SLEEP WITH MARTIN AMIS OR ANYONE FAMOUS AT TWENTY ONE I SCOTCHED MY CHANCE TO BE ONE OF THE SEDUCTRESSES OF THE CENTURY A VAMP ON THE RISE THROUGH THE RANKS OF LITERARY GODS AND MILITARY MEN WHO would not STOP AT THE PRESIDENT {she had / she would} TAKE THE PENTAGON BY STORM IN HALTER DRESS AND RHINESTONE EXTRAS LETTING FLY THE BREASTS THAT SHATTER CRYSTAL THEN DUMP HIM TOO AND BREAK HIS POWER BROKER HEART SUCH

CERTAINLY AND I SAID OH I SEE { he's / he was / he is / he has} JUST TALKING YES THIS POETRY'S NO DIFFERENT FROM SOMEBODY ACTUALLY TALKING FOR REAL AND THE REASON I had not BEEN ABLE TO READ HIM IS THAT MY {father's / father is / father has} POETRY AND ALL THE POETRY {i had / i would} EVER READ WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEBODY TALKING NOT FOR REAL OR A DIFFERENT STYLE THAN REAL CONVERSATION {it's / it is / it has} LIKE IF HE READS A SONNET OR {it's / it is / it has} A LITERARY SOUND OR {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A PUN OR ON SOMEBODY {else's / else is / else has} POEM OR IT HAS SOME STALE WASH OF ANOTHER POEM OVER IT BUT THIS WAS JUST ABSOLUTE STRAIGHTFORWARD WELL CONVERSATION I GUESS OR DECLARATION OR SPEECH BUT THE POETRY WAS IDENTICAL WITH INTENSE FRAGMENTS OF SPOKEN IDIOM AS YOU MIGHT HEAR AT MARSEILLE HIMSELF AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME {i had / i would} EVER HEARD OF SUCH A NOTION THAT THE POETRY COULD BE REAL OR THAT REALIT THAT IT COULD BE SOMEBODY TALKING FOR REAL INSTEAD OF MAKING UP A POEM LIKE OR MAKING UP MAKING IT UP TO LOOK GOOD AND I do not KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT I COULD I do not KNOW HOW IF I COULD EVEN YOU KNOW DESCRIBE WHAT MY IDEA OF POETRY WAS BEFORE I SAID I WAS SUPPOSED IT I did not BECAUSE I JUST NEVER THOUGHT IT OUT BUT IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT COULD BE IDENTICAL WITH ACTUAL SPEECH AND ONCE I UNDERSTOOD THAT THEN I COULD START READING THEM AND I BEGAN READING IT AND AND THAT REALLY BLEW MY MIND THEN AFTER THAT HE I THINK WAS HE READ let us SEE PURE PRODUCTS OF AMERICA GO CRAZY AND THAT WAS VERY MOVING YEAH BECAUSE I FIN FINALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS NIFTY I THOUGHT THAT I COULD PUT THE ACCENT IN THIS OTHER STYLE AND WE DEGRADED PER HIS DESTINY ABOUT HOW HUNGER CAN FEED ITSELF AND THEN THE INTERESTING THING WAS WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE AN IMAGINATION OF HEAVEN OR WHAT HE DESIRED IT WAS A REAL DOWN TO EARTH {it's / it is / it has} A VERY COMMON WHILE HE WHILE THE IMAGINATION IS STRANGE ENOUGH THAT IT FEELS OVERWROUGHT AND STIFLING AND SOME KIND STRANGE WITH DEER GOING EVERYTHING IS STRANGE AFTER DEER GOING BY AND FIELDS WERE STUCK WITH THIS THIS GOLDENROD AND THE STIFLING STIFLING HE WOULD some timeS some how IT SEEMS TO HIS STRIDE YEAH NO ONE TO WITNESS AND ADJUST NO ONE TO DRIVE A CAR WITNESS AND ADJUST {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT SO NOW ONCE I ONCE I GOT THE IDEA THAT HE WAS TALKING FOR REAL AND THEN HE SAID SOMETHING AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS THAT WE GOT TO EAT SHIT I MEAN W WHAT HE WAS SAYING THAT THE WAY WE ARE LIVING {it's / it is / it has} LIKE {we are / we were} EATING SHIT INSTEAD OF YEAH INSTEAD OF OUR DESIRE TO SEEM {that's / that is / that has} TO THE HUNGER TOO YEAH NOTES THAT SEEMS REALLY RADICAL TO ME AND AMAZING THAT ANYBODY WOULD BE SAYING ANYTHING SO INTERIOR AND FRANK AND REALISTIC JUST LIKE {you had / you would} THINK TO YOURSELF WHEN {you are / you were} ALONE IN BED AT NIGHT AND some how THAT TURNED THAT CHANGED IT TURNED ME AROUND COMPLETELY AS FAR AS WHAT POETRY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BECAUSE BEFORE THAT {i had / i would} BEEN WRITING RHYMED VERSE IMITATING SIR THOMAS WYATT THAT POET I ASSUME {that's / that is / that has} SENSING YOUR OFFICE CALVES AND THOSE {it's / it is / it has} NOT SIMPLY A DEPRESSED STATE OF MIND BUT {it's / it is / it has} A SENSE THAT THE THAT THE RESOURCES OF THE TERMINATIONS OF THE COMMON WORLD THE HAVE REALLY BEEN DIS DISAPPOINTING TO PUT IT MILDLY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY USED TO NOTHING MORE THAN HOPE TO USE TO TO TO TO EITHER ACT TO TO TO TO TO RE TO FACT AND OR HOPE might have MIGHT might have PROVEN THE CASE CHRIS WEETABIX HAS BEEN TALKING THE GROUP OF NOT THAT IF A YOUNGER A BIT OF UNDERGRADUATE CLASS REHEARSING THE THE POLITICAL EVENTS OF THE LAST OF YESTERDAY PARTICULARLY AND THEN DISPOSITION FOR EXAMPLE ALAN HAD A PIECE FROM THE BOSTON GLOBE WHICH HAS BEEN DOING A AN INTENSIVE INVESTIGATORY BUSINESS ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION OF THE FBI AND THE FBI HAD HAD OBVIOUSLY BEE HAD PULLED BACK FROM USING ITS OWN PEOPLE AND COVERED ILLEGAL INFORMATION THIS IS IT AND APPARENTLY {it's / it is / it has} GOT A WHOLE SORT OF ALMOST ONE WANTS TO SAY A SUBCULTURE OF EAGER BEAVERS AND VOLUNTARY PEOPLE VIGILANTE YEAH YEAH VIGILANTE GROUPS THAT ARE PRACTICALLY DOING THE SAME INVESTIGATIONS AFOREMENTIONED ALL ALL ILLEGAL BUT NOT CONSTITUTING YOU KNOW FEDERAL DEVELOPMENTS OF COMMON AGENCY FUNNY ANYHOW {we are / we were} TALKING ABOUT THIS BOOK AND THIS i am TALKING ABOUT THE SANDINISTAS AND COULD ONE THINK OF IT AS SIMPLY GOOD GUYS VERSUS BAD GUYS AND ALAN HAD SEEN THEM REPEATING IN THE S IN THE ON THE B THE BATHROOM JUST MOMENTS AGO THAT SAID IF YOU IF YOU LIKE CUBA you will REALLY LOVE NICARAGUA SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WOULD THAT THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT WERE WERE SIMPLY SWEETNESS AND LIGHT JUST YEAH BUT IN FACT IT IS A VERY YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A VERY ONE ONE PARTY GOVERNMENT WITH VERY DETERMINED ATTITUDES AND AND VERY REAL SENSES OF OF SOCIAL CONDUCT BEING YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THE PRO OR CON OR AGAINST IT SO THAT THE VERY WITH YOU OR AGAINST YOU IS THEIR THINKING YEAH REALLY REALLY VERY DETERMINING OF CERTAIN CONFLICTS INSTEAD OF A SORT OF NOW THAT I THINK OTHER THINKING OF THE ISRAELI COLLEGE STANDING IN BUSINESS BUT I WAS THINKING {it's / it is / it has} BLEAK INDEED THESE DAYS IT WAS OBVIOUSLY BLEAK IN WILLIAMS'S TIME EQUALLY TO THINK OF WHAT YOU COULD PROPOSE AS A VIABLE AND CONSEQUENT WORLD FOR THESE IMAGINATIONS AND OR THE PRACTICAL VIOLENCE UP AND BEYOND TWO HUNDRED WORDS FOREVER I FELT THAT ENDING ONE TIME {i had / i would} FALLEN FOR THAT WITH TWO VISITS THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT A BETTER PLACE JUST FELT IT YEAH I FELT IT I FELT THE NEED FOR THE ME AND HIS FEARS OF NOTHING THAT WHAT HE SAID REALLY FUCK THINGS UP HE did not USE THAT EXPRESSION BUT THAT WAS THE %bcack YEAH THAT WAS MID FIFTIES THAT WAS THAT WAS THE MID FIFTIES X WELL {he had / he would} BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO COMMUNISM A LITTLE {i had / i would} BET YEAH WELL let us THINK OF IT IN GREEN BRUSHER i am THINKING YEAH GOOD YOU WANT TO BE MARRIED YOUR MARRIAGE YEAH OR TO PAINT CHURCH AS A PUNISHMENT YEAH WHEN { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOT THE moneys does not SAY PAINT with out THE with out THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE %bcack YEAH BECAUSE YEAH THIS IS THE TIME WHEN HE WRITES THAT POEM BECAUSE I THINK {it's / it is / it has} I REMEMBER IT BEING PUBLISHED IN THE LATE FORTIES THE FORTIES AND I THINK HE HAD SOMETHING IN HIS FIFTIES IT WAS A CHAP BOOK THAT RICHARD WORDS EMBASSY PUBLISHED CALLED THE PINK CHURCH AND THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THE WHOLE DEFAMATION OF FELLOW TRAVELERS AND PINKOS %bcack WAS VERY ACTIVE AND YOU CALL YOU CALLED PEOPLE CANDIDATES SO {you had / you would} PARODY WRITING A POEM CALLED PINK CHURCH RIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN HE SAID AND COME ALL YOU COMMUNIST SO AND SO AMATEUR DRUNKS AND SURREALISTS YOU KNOW WHAT has not COME IS THERE SOMETHING THERE IT SAID THE ANSWER WAS AND MILTON'S SINGING AMONG THE REST BY THE COMMUNISTS RIGHT YEAH MILTON LEANNE RYMES ARE SINGING AMONG THE REST OF THE CONGRESS %bcack AND {it's / it is / it has} AN INCREDIBLE TURN OF POEM THE PINK CHURCH IS LITERALLY A

Gladman-Renee_Complete-Reading_Drawing-Room_Tuscon_AZ_02-21-09 A a 0.131 355.97 FEELS GOOD THAT JOY LASTS AS LONG AS YOUR WALK THROUGH THE CITY AND DISSOLVES WHEN YOU RETURN HOME TO YOUR WORK TO HO HOW FAR THERE IS LEFT TO GO WITH IT IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN I MOVED INTO A TWO BEDROOM FAT FLAT JUST UP THE STREET FROM MY PREVIOUS RESIDENCE THOUGH HERE EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT NOW I HAD ONE ROOMMATE INSTEAD OF THREE WHICH MEANT I COULD OCCUPY THE LIVING SPACE LESS ANONYMOUSLY THE REASON I AT TIMES EXPERIENCE CERTAINTY THAT I STARTED THIS BOOK IN THE SUMMER OF NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT IS THAT THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THIS NEW BEDROOM I SAW MY FIRST CONCRETE TREE I WAS STRUCK BY WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN ANOMALY UNTIL I BEGAN SEEING THIS TYPE OF TREE ALL OVER THAT UNIQUE CITY WITHIN THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES OF THE NOVELLA AFTER THAT YOU WILL FIND THE CONCRETE TREE OUTSIDE MY WINDOW WRITTEN QUITE SIMPLY YEARS LATER I WOULD HAVE TO REWRITE THAT PASSAGE AS TOO MANY PEOPLE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT CONCRETE TREE WORRIED OVER ITS INCONGRUOUS PRESENCE A FEW MONTHS AGO I ADDRESSED THIS CONCERN BY CHANGING THE TEXT TO THE TREES OUTSIDE MY WINDOW ARE THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF ARCHITECTURAL LEAPS INTENDED TO BEAUTIFY THIS CITY THESE SAPLINGS PROTECTED BY CYLINDRICAL HOLES OF CONCRETE TO THOSE OF YOU WHO ALSO LIVED IN THIS GREAT CEMENT CITY I apologise FOR SUCH AN OVERT DESCRIPTION BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS ONE can not UNDERSTAND AS O IF ONE HAS NEVER SEEN THEM FOR INSTANCE IT NEVER SNOWED IN MY PREVIOUS CITY THE CITY OF THE NOVELLA YET TODAY IT IS LATE MARCH IN MY NEW CITY AND FLURRIES BLOW PAST THE WINDOW I HAVE CALLED CHUBBY TO TELL HER THIS AND SHE SPUTTERS WHAT WHAT WRAPPING HER MIND AROUND THE CONCEPT THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN {you are / you were} EDITING is not IT YOU MOVE TEXT AROUND YOU DELETE SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE ANTICIPATED EFFECT ON YOUR TRIAL READER YOU WRITE DOWN SOMEWHERE THAT YOU HAVE DELETED THAT THING THEN YOU PUT A QUESTION MARK BESIDE IT HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I BEEN THROWN INTO CONFUSION WHEN EXPLAINING TO SOMEONE THE CUTS i have MADE THAT PERSON BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE TRIAL READER AND THAT PERSON HAS RESPONDED WITH A VIOLENT SHAKE OF THE HEAD PRESSING THE POINT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT PUT IT BACK IN THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE DONE THAT MATCHES THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE RUN TO A NEARBY PARK THROWN MYSELF ON A BENCH AND FALLEN OVER WITH MY HEAD IN MY LAP MY HANDS SCRAPING THE GROUND WITH THE SMALLEST OF SMILES ON MY FACE CONFUSION IS A GIFT I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE SMILE SIMILARLY WHEN I AM IN THE MIDST OF AN OVERWHELMING SADNESS THOSE MOODS THAT HAVE NO IDENTIFIABLE CAUSE I BEGIN TO MARVEL OVER THE ABILITY TO HAVE SUCH FEELINGS I WRITE SOMETHING DOWN USUALLY ON A LOOSE SHEET OF PAPER THINKING THE FEELING'S TOO FLEETING FOR MY DIARY AND GIVE THAT SMILE AGAIN BURIED IN THE TYPICAL FROWN OF SADNESS BECAUSE WHAT i have WRITTEN IS BEYOND ME EVENTUALLY ONE COMES TO KNOW WHAT BELONGS IN A BOOK ONE IS WRITING AND WHAT DOES NOT AND EVENTUALLY ONE CHANGES {one's / one is / one was / one has} MIND ON ALL OF THIS I FINISHED THE FINAL VERSION OF THE NOVELLA AFTER THAT some time LATE SUMMER TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AFTER TWO EXTENSIVE REWRITINGS AND PROBABLY TWO LESS INTENSE REWORKINGS AND COUNTLESS LINE AND PARAGRAPH EDITS PLUS TWO SHELVINGS AND ONE ALMOST UTTER SHREDDING AND THEN I RAN OUTSIDE THE RELIEF I FELT WAS TREMENDOUS THOUGH ULTIMATELY SHORT LIVED YOU HAVE FINISHED YOUR NOVELLA I TOLD MYSELF YOU HAVE MADE A PLACE FOR IT I WAS IN MY NEW CITY WHEN I SAID THIS I HAD CHANGED CITIES BECAUSE I COULD NOT STAND TO SEE THE DEMISE OF MY OLD ONE THOUGH I WAS AWARE THAT I HAD BEEN LIVING IN ITS ENTRAILS FOR SOME TIME BUT I DO NOT THINK I NEED TO REITERATE MY REASONS FOR BLINDING MYSELF TO THAT REALITY AS IT GOES I MOVED MANY PLACES AT FIRST THEN FINALLY SETTLED ON THIS NEW ONE WHY AM I HERE I ASKED MYSELF WALKING AMONG ITS THOUSANDS OF GHOSTS I COULD NOT FIND AN ANSWER BUT IN THE INTERIM I MET A GIRL AND BECAME ENAMORED WITH HER SHE WILL BE REFERRED TO AS M I SHOWED THE NOVELLA TO M ONCE SHE HAD READ MY OTHER WORK AND UPON FINISHING IT SHE SAID STUDYING ME WE WERE IN A VERY LARGE PARK I THINK SHE TURNED HER HEAD TO SEE IF THIS PARK MIRRORED THE ONE REFERRED TO IN THE NOVEL I did not WRITE IT HERE I EXPLAINED IT TO HER SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO BELIEVE ME WELL PEOPLE WILL THINK WHAT THEY WANT IT IS THEIR RIGHT I SUPPOSE BUT AFTER THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN THIS CITY I WROTE IT IN A PLACE OF PERPETUAL SUN A PLACE THAT NEVER ROSE ABOVE THIRTY DEGREES CELSIUS i have GIVEN UP FAHRENHEIT IN PROTEST OF THE GOVERNMENT IT NEVER SANK BELOW TEN A PLACE OF CROWDS THAT DID NOT OVERWHELM ONE AS THEY DO HERE A PLACE WHOSE INCOMPARABLE EASE EXPLAINS THE NEAR FLATNESS OF THE WRITING THIS FLATNESS WHICH I COULD NEVER ALTER AND ALWAYS HAUNTED ME THAT FIRST SUMMER IN MY NEW CITY THE SENSATION OF MY OWN FLATNESS WAS VERY STRONG WITH M IN THE PARK I WAS STRUCK BY THE PERSISTENCE OF IT THIS FEELING WHICH I THOUGHT HAD RID I HAD RID MYSELF OF BY SIMPLY MATURING AS A PERSON HAD NEVER LEFT ME IT HAD JUST TAKEN ON ANOTHER FORM MANIFESTING ITSELF DIFFERENTLY YET DEEP DEEPER WITH EVERY SUBSEQUENT BOOK IT STRIKES OFTEN AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN i am REVIEWING SOME WORK I HAVE JUST WRITTEN AND I FIND MYSELF THINKING THAT IT IS NOT WRITING THAT I HAVE DONE IT IS SPEECH OR AIR PLAIN AIR IT IS ZERO IT IS A GESTURE A SIGN AN INDICATION OF WRITING BUT NOT WRITING NOT AT ALL WRITING
Greenwald-Ted_Complete-Recording_WAMU-FM_3-26-76 A a 0.207 349.904 NOWADAYS i am MORE OR LESS CONTENT TO LET A LOT OF THINGS TAKE THEIR OWN COURSES LIKE AMIABLE RIVERS MAKING BLUE LINES DOWN THE MAP OF HISTORY i am NOT SAYING THAT SOME THINGS do not INFURIATE ME THEY CERTAINLY DO BUT i have LEARNED MOSTLY THROUGH STUPID REPETITION THE SAME PATIENCE I APPLY TO MY OWN WORKS MOVING THEM OUT OF RANGE OF GOOD AND EVIL IS APPLICABLE IN A ROMANTIC WAY I GUESS TO THINGS NATURAL AND UNNATURAL OUTSIDE MYSELF i am ON BETTER TERMS THOUGH STILL ABLE TO BEAR GRUDGES WITH MOST THINGS AND PEOPLE MORE SOCIAL SOCIALLY AMIABLE NO LONGER STAND IN A CORNER AT PARTIES FACING INTO THE WALL SMELLING THE SCHOOL LIKE PLASTER GETTING PLASTERED NOW I TALK IT UP AND EVEN WHEN DOWN NEVER TALK DOWN BUT REMAIN SUBDUED i have LEARNED TO LIKE WINTERS MORE BUT HATE THE END OF SAME FEEL RELIEF AT SPRING CRAVE SUN ON BODY ENTER THROUGH THE LOBBY OF ANNUAL DEPRESSION HAVE GREATER SENSE OF PERSONAL COMFORT EXPANDING HORIZONS ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND KNOW HOW FAR i will GO TO DO IN THIS YEAR OF FAMINE AND PESTILENCE HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP MY MIND AND EAR COCKED LIKE A GUN FOR THE TRUE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE TO GO OFF AND FILL THE SKY OF THE MIND WITH ANGELS CONVERSING AND HAVE ENOUGH MEMORY LEFT TO REMEMBER AND WRITE THE ANGELS DOWN with out PINNING A SINGLE BODY OR WING I HAVE FINALLY RETURNED TO THE CHEERFULNESS I HAD WHEN VERY YOUNG BEFORE THE BUBBLES IN MY PERSONAL SELTZER HAD GONE FLAT WHEN THE FINGERS OF SCHOOL HAVING OPENED MY THINKING PAT HAVING OPENED MY THINKING CAP KEPT THE BOTTLE OPEN LONG ENOUGH TO LET THE FUN OUT AMIDST THE MULTITUDE OF OTHERS ASKING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER what ever HAPPENED TO YOU YOU WERE SUCH A CHEERFUL KID AND THAT I AM WHIFF AN EVENING SPENT TALKING SPENT THINKING ABOUT WHAT MY LIFE WOULD BE IF {i had / i would} STAYED WITH A PARTICULAR GIRL OR WOMAN I WENT WITH WHAT WOULD BE IF {i had / i would} HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED TO AND GONE WHERE I APPLIED TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL THAN THE ONE I DID WHERE {i had / i would} LEARN DIFFERENT SOCIAL GRACES THAN THE ONES I HAVE WHERE SOME OF THE MATERIAL VALUES OF THE AMERICAN DREAM HAD RUBBED OFF ENOUGH TO MAKE ME LIVE IT OUT IN THE GOOD WORK SENSE IF {i had / i would} SETTLED DOWN AND SETTLED FOR THE FOUNDATION ON A HOUSE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS INSTEAD OF ASSUMING IMMEDIATE IMMEDIATELY PAST GENERATIONS MY FOUNDATION TO MINE IF {i had / i would} HAVE BEEN A LITTLE QUICKER TO LEARN WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF ME AND WANTING TO PLEASE PLEASED GOING ON THAT WAY THROUGH ALL ETERNITY i have PROBABLY BEEN SAVED FROM MERE ROUTINES BY A STREAK OF STUBBORNNESS BY A SLOW MIND AND TENDENCY TO DRIFT BY AN EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT REQUIRES MY PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING BEFORE HAPPENING FEELING OUT THE IMPLICATIONS AN EMOTION HAS IN FORM OF EXPECTATION BEFORE TRYING OUT AND AFTER AWARENESS I SENSE A WILLINGNESS TO TELL SOMEONE I KNOW AND LIKE AND SENSE THE SAME FROM ANYTHING {they had / they would} LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ME AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A VAST SENSE OF PRIVACY WHICH MEANS {there's / there is / there has} NO WAY i will WEAR OUT MY PERSONALITY AND ITS SENSE OF CONTINUITY ALTHOUGH some timeS I FEEL EMPTY BUT TALKING TO SOMEONE I LIKE AND TRUST AND SENSE THE SAME FROM I FEEL WAY UP AND AFTER A LONG EVENING OF TALK ABOUT THIS AND THAT FEEL WIDE AWAKE AND FEEL THE WORLD WIDE AND AWAKE AROUND ME AND HAVE A VISUAL INTENSITY AND MEMORY THAT IN NEAR MEMORY DULLS AND THROBS AND GROWS VIVID AS HELL WHEN I BRING IT TO MIND SOME TIME FROM THEN WHAT MY LIFE would have BEEN LIKE UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES IT would have BEEN DIFFERENT WITH ITS OWN ATTENDANT IFS AND ITS OWN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT THIS WAY i have ELECTED TO FOLLOW AND CAST MY VOTE EACH WAKING DAY IN I AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF TAKING THE PAST TOO SERIOUSLY OR FEELING ANY BITTERNESS OR SADNESS THIS WAY WHEN MY SHIP COMES IN i will HAVE PASSED OUT OF MIND BEYOND THE SIGHT OF LAND AND will not HESITATE FOR A SECOND TO LOOK BACK ON ALL THIS WITH FONDNESS OR REMISS THE AIR'LL BE CLEAR THE MOON'LL BE THERE AND YOU who ever YOU ARE AND HOPE TO BE WILL BE HERE WITH MY LOVE NINTH STREET OLD PEOPLE OLD PEOPLE LARGE CLOUDS HIGH WITH EXPANSES OF HIGH BLUE PALM

BOTH WERE FIGHTERS MY MOTHER AND FATHER I REMEMBER HIM PULLING THE TABLECLOTH OFF THE TABLE WHEN HIS BREAKFAST did not SUIT HIM WHAT A MESS AND THE TIME SHE THREW A MEAT CLEAVER AFTER HIM AND IT STUCK IN THE DOORJAMB INCHES FROM HIS HEAD HE STOPPED AND SHE SAYS HE TURNED PALE BUT HE LEFT TIME AND AGAIN HE LEFT AND WHEN HE CAME BACK {it's / it is / it has} CALLED COMING BACK HOME AFTER A FEW MONTHS OR what ever TIME {they had / they would} GET ALONG UNTIL THEY did not WE MOVED ALL OVER TEXAS NEVER MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN A PLACE USUALLY IT WAS CLOSER TO THREE OR FOUR AND THEY FOUGHT WHEREVER THEY WERE TOGETHER SO I NEVER MADE ANY FRIENDS THAT LASTED AND EVERYTHING WAS VARIOUS DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT WAS JUST MY MOTHER AND ME OR WHETHER MY FATHER WAS THERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE TRYING TO RUN A RESTAURANT TOGETHER OR WHETHER MY MOTHER WAS WORKING AS A WAITRESS DO YOU KNOW THAT BREAKFAST SHIFT DINNER SHIFT SWING SHIFT VOCABULARY OR THERE WAS A ONCE WHEN SHE WORKED IN A CANDY FACTORY COATING CHOCOLATES AND PUTTING THE IDENTIFYING LITTLE SWIRL ON TOP WHAT I REMEMBER MOST OFTEN IS THAT WE WERE JUST THE TWO OF {us / u. s.} LIVING IN A BEDROOM IN {somebody's / somebody is / somebody has} HOUSE AND MY {mother's / mother is / mother has} SALARY WOULD RUN TEN DOLLARS A WEEK AND THE ROOM PLUS BOARD FOR ME AND THE LANDLADIES LOOKING AFTER ME WOULD RUN SEVEN I do not MEAN TO MAKE THIS SOUND PATHETIC AT SOME TIME DURING THAT WHEN I WAS FIVE I STARTED SCHOOL AND I WAS A WHIZ I WENT THROUGH THE FIRST AND SECOND GRADE THE FIRST YEAR AND I WENT THROUGH THE THIRD AND FOURTH GRADE THE SECOND YEAR AND THE THIRD YEAR WHEN I WAS SEVEN I WAS IN THE FIFTH GRADE AND BROKE MY ARM TWICE SO I GOT SLOWED DOWN THAT would have BEEN WHEN WE WERE IN MINERAL WELLS MY FATHER WAS WITH {us / u. s.} THEN AND WE WERE LIVING IN A THREE ROOM HOUSE WITH A YARD AND HONEYSUCKLE ON THE PORCH AT THE BOTTOM OF A HILL {that's / that is / that has} NOTABLE FOR A LINE OF TWENTY FOOT HIGH BLOCK LETTERS FILLED WITH REGULAR LIGHT BULBS THAT IN THE NIGHT GLARED OUT WELCOME TOWARDS THE HIGHWAY I LOVED THAT SIGN IT FELT LIKE BEING IN CHURCH TO STAND AT THE BASE OF THOSE LETTERS JUST TO FINISH THAT PART OF THE STORY THE NEXT YEAR WE WENT TO NEW MEXICO AND I WENT FROM BEING A WHIZ TO PASSING THE SIXTH GRADE CONDITIONALLY I WAS A KIND OF HOUSE DUMMY THEREAFTER I do not REMEMBER WHETHER I HAD ANY NOTION OF WHAT WENT WRONG IT FEELS LIKE YEARS OF CHAOS MY FATHER FINALLY TRULY LEFT AROUND THEN WE SAT IN MY AUNT {thelma's / thelma is / thelma has} HOUSE SOUTH OF ALBUQUERQUE AND HE ROAMED IN THE NIGHT AROUND THE HOUSE YELLING NORA AND MY UNCLE EVERETT WOULD YELL BACK NORA does not WANT YOU any more AND i have GOT A TWENTY TWO HERE AND MY FATHER FINALLY LEFT FOR GOOD BUT WHILE I FEEL LIKE THAT HAS TO BE TOLD some how THESE FEW PAGES GOING THE WAY they have GONE WHAT I REALLY WANT TO MENTION AND IT TOOK ME UNTIL YESTERDAY TO GET IT INTO THE AIR IS THAT ALL THAT TIME PENNED RIGHT FROM THE FIRST READING WAS MY DARLING PLEASURE THERE WAS A RUNNING SET OF LIES THAT GOT HANDED TO ME ALL THE TIME I WAS GROWING UP WHENEVER ISSUE NUMBER ONE CAME UP ALL THE {women's / women is / women has } FACES CHANGED AND ALL THE GIRLS WERE LIED TO I realise IT WAS A CONSERVATIVE'S AND PROTECTIVE DEVICE BUT AT MY END OF IT IT ADDED UP TO A LOT OF CONFUSION FOR INSTANCE MY FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY WAS MARKED BY MY FIRST VISIT TO A DENTIST DENTISTS ARE ON HARD TIMES IN WEST TEXAS WHERE THE WATER HAS NATURAL FLUORIDE MY {mother's / mother is / mother has} NEARING SIXTY AND HAS HAD THREE FILLINGS ALL HER LIFE LONG AND SHE GOT THOSE BECAUSE SHE MOVED AWAY FROM TEXAS ANYWAY AT THE TIME i am TALKING ABOUT WE WERE LIVING IN YORK PENNSYLVANIA TO BE NEAR MY STEPFATHER BEFORE HE WENT OFF TO WAR AND IT WAS MY FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY AND I WAS GOING TO THE DENTIST FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE BO A BOY WHO WAS MAYBE SIXTEEN WAS GOING TO COME TO THE APARTMENT LATER AND FORMALLY ASK MY PARENTS IF HE COULD TAKE ME ON MY FIRST OFFICIAL DATE THEY HAD AGREED THAT HE COULD ASK SO IT SEEMED LIKELY THE ANSWER WAS YES WHILE I WAS AT THE DENTIST'S MY MOTHER STARTED TO SHOW DUTCH THE PRESENTS I HAD GOT FROM MY FRIENDS THREE OR FOUR SMALL THINGS ONE OF WHICH WAS THE CLASSIC FIVE YEAR DIARY WHICH FELL OPEN WHEN SHE LAID IT DOWN TO WHAT I HAD IMMEDIATELY WRITTEN IN ON RECEIVING IT SO AS NOT TO FORGET THE ENTRY WAS THE WEEK BEFORE IN THE MOVIE HOUSE WITH MY FRIENDS I HAD KISSED THE BOY WHO WAS DUE TO ARRIVE AROUND FOUR THIS AFTERNOON IT WAS THERE IN BLACK AND WHITE WITH ECSTATIC EXCLAMATION MARKS THAT ENTRY PROVED TO BE THE FIRST AND LAST OF THAT POSSIBILITY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DAYS DOWN THE DRAIN PRECLUDED BY STUPIDITY I HAD TAKEN THE ABSTRACTION OF MY DIARY AS AN ALLOWANCE PROOF AGAINST GETTING HOISTED ON THE HOOK BECAUSE YOU WROTE IT DOWN THE POWER OF A DEFINED OCCASION AND I LEARNED THE WAY IT REALLY WAS WHEN I GOT BACK FROM THE DENTIST AND FACED THOSE TWO FACES ME THE BIRTHDAY GIRL AND THEM THE TRIBUNAL THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT I HAD MADE A MISTAKE MY MOTHER TOOK ME INTO THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO ME KISSING IN THE MOVIES IS VULGAR BUT WORSE THAN THAT AND SHE RANG THE SHIFT ON ME NO GIRL

AN UNSTILLED GRIEF EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE GARDEN BEYOND IT THERE IS MEASURED TIME AND SPACE AND A CALM IN THE COOL STONE COOL LOVERS I TOO MOVE MY NAKED AND IMMENSE HANDS AND FEET THROUGH THE OLD HIGH WOODEN ROOMS AND THEN OUT INTO TREES FILTERING SUMMER SUN ONTO OTHER FORMS OTHER STATUES OUTDOORS AND REST MY LONG ARM AS IN THE KISS ON A SLAB OF THE UNWORKED STONE THERE IS A RAW DESIRE IN THE COOL BUT SUNNY DAY THUS I FIND MY WAY BACK INTO STONE ITS CERTAINTY THE GARDEN BEHIND THE HOUSE ITS LIGHT AND SHADOWS ON STATUES BRING MEMORY OUT WITH THEM INTO THE BRIGHTER OPEN AIR IN THE MUSEUM ITSELF A WOMAN SITS SKETCHING A WOMAN LYING ALONG HER STONE BED ON A BENCH IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT A WOMAN LIES BESIDE THE FIGURE OF ANOTHER RECLINING LIKE A CAT STRETCHES AND SLEEPS AGAIN IN THE SUN THEY BOTH LOOK EQUALLY ALIVE ONE ASLEEP IN FLESH THE OTHER EYES CLOSED AWAKE IN STONE i am GOING TO READ A FEW NEW THINGS WHICH YOU MAY N MAY OR NOT NOTICE BUT {they are / they were} {they are / they were} SORT OF DIFFERENT TO IT BECAUSE {they are / they were} OH i will SAY EIGHTY SIX WHERE ARE WE NOW THIS IS TWO THOUSAND TEN SO {that's / that is / that has} S SIXTEEN YEARS RIGHT TWENTY FOUR YEARS TWENTY FOUR THANKS YEAH YEAH IT WAS A THERE WAS A ANYBODY ANY ANYBODY LISTEN TO CAR TALK YEAH SO THEY W THEY TOLD THIS JOKE ABOUT SOMEBODY on line AND IT YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} AT THE SUPERMARKET AND {it's / it is / it has} LIKE TEN ITEMS OR LESS AND THE PERSON HAS ALL THESE ITEMS YOU KNOW THAT { he's / he was / he is / he has} UNLOADING ONTO THE CONVEYOR BELT AND THE CASHIER SAYS TO HIM YOU KNOW EITHER {you are / you were} FROM MIT WHICH MEANS YOU {can not / cannot} READ OR {you are / you were} FROM HARVARD WHICH MEANS YOU {can not / cannot} COUNT SO SO {you are / you were} FROM HARVARD YEAH WELL NOT FROM HARVARD BUT ANYWAY YEAH all right LET ME START WITH MY NEWEST PIECE AND AND KIND OF WORK BACKWARDS {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} A GREAT WAY TO SEE IF A POEM WORKS IS TO READ IT ALOUD TO TO PEOPLE SO NOW I HAVE TO AGAIN GIVE YOU SOME BACKSTORY HERE THERE WAS {there's / there is / there has} A FILM THAT CAME OUT IN NEW YORK I IT IT WAS APPEARED AT A COUPLE OF THEATERS AND IT HAD A SHORT RUN A FEW MONTHS AGO CALLED AN UNFINISHED FILM AND THE OCCASION OF THE FILM WAS THAT SOME FOOTAGE FROM THE WARSAW GHETTO WAS UNEARTHED NO ONE KNEW ABOUT AND AND I F i am FORGETTING THE NAME OF THIS DIRECTOR UTTERLY BRILLIANT DIRECTOR SHE TOOK THIS FOOTAGE AND PUT TOGETHER THIS AMAZING FILM WITH VOICEOVER AND SO ON AND SO THIS IS A POEM ABOUT WATCHING THAT FILM NOW LET ME JUST TELL YOU IF YOU do not KNOW ABOUT THE FILM {it's / it is / it has} NOT LIKE {it's / it is / it has} NOT LIKE THE THE FILM FOOTAGE OF THERESIENSTADT AND MAYBE SOME PEOPLE do not KNOW WHAT THERESIENSTADT WAS BUT DURING WORLD WAR TWO THE GERMANS CREATED A A F A FAKE OR A MOCK U NOT WELL NO A A FAKE CONCENTRATION CAMP AND THEY THEY FILMED EVERYBODY THERE AND THE PEOPLE LOOKED WELL FED AND THEY WERE DOING INTERESTING THINGS AND THEY WERE HAPPY THESE THESE WERE THE JEWS WHO HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM O ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE AND PLACED THERE AND IT WAS YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A PROPAGANDA THING YOU KNOW WELL AN UNFINISHED FILM THE PERSON WHO DEVISED THIS THIS FILM HAD A VER HAD SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IN MIND BECAUSE RATHER THAN JUST HAVE IT WELL I MEAN I THINK INITIALLY THEY WANTED IT THE GERMANS WANTED IT TO BE FOR PUBLICITY BUT THEY KIND OF WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR OR THEY REALLY GOT TOO INVOLVED BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} CLEAR FROM THE FROM THE FOUND FOOTAGE AND BY THE WAY {there's / there is / there has} LIKE A SECOND CAMERA AND THERE MAY HAVE EVEN IN AT CERTAIN POINTS BEEN A THIRD CAMERA SO LIKE THE SECOND CAMERA WILL SHOW THE FIRST CAMERAMAN FILMING THE INHABITANTS OF THE GHETTO WHO ARE BEING MADE TO ACT IN CERTAIN SC IN CERTAIN SCENES THAT HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED AND AND IN FACT ONE OF THE CAMERAMEN WAS FOUND AND WAS INTERVIEWED FOR THE FILM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THE WARSAW GHETTO WHO ARE ALSO THEY {they are / they were} FILMED WATCHING THE FOOTAGE AND THEN MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND WE WELL SO SO SO THE SCENES ARE AND THIS IS LIKE EARLY IN THE WARSAW GHETTO SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THERE FROM ALL OVER YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE MORE MONEY THAN THAN OTHERS AND YOU KNOW SO I MEAN YOU SEE P YOU SEE BODIES LYING IN THE STREET {it's / it is / it has} NOT THAT THE GERMANS ARE NOT TRYING TO SHOW THAT BUT WHAT THEY DECIDED TO DO WAS TO SHOW THAT AND THEN SHOW THE WAY PEOPLE REACTED TO THAT KIND OF THING SO they will HAVE PEOPLE they will they will DO TWENTY TAKES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SORT OF WELL DRESSED AND ALSO POOR PEOPLE WALKING AROUND A BODY {that's / that is / that has} LYING ON THE SIDEWALK OR A BAKERY AND {there's / there is / there has} A COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE WINDOW AND they will SHOW THE THE REALLY RAGGEDY PEOPLE LOOKING AT LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY THEY PARADE THE WELL SHOD JEWS IN YOU KNOW AS IF {they are / they were} GOING TO BUY SOMETHING AND THEY DO THA YOU KNOW YOU SEE ONE TAKE AFTER ANOTHER SO W I THINK WHAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW THE SURMISAL IS THAT SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY realiseD THAT THIS FILM WAS WAS A LITTLE TOO REVEALING AND IT DOES SAY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW A S A PERHAPS A NEED TO SHAME PEOPLE RATHER THAN JUST YOU KNOW KILL THEM

THERE AS A MODEL AND I SAID TO MY BELOVED SPOUSE JENN I THINK THAT {that's / that is / that has} A REALLY SIMPLISTIC ARGUMENT AND SHE SAID i am GOING TO WRITE TO ZIZEK AND TELL HIM THAT YOU THINK { he's / he was / he is / he has} SIMPLISTIC IN ANY CASE i am STILL GOING TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT AND i am GOING TO READ ONE POEM {that's / that is / that has} A TRANSLATION OF AN EXCERPT FROM A BOOK BY A POET NAMED FLORENCIA WALFISCH WHO IS A YEAR OLDER THAN ME LIVING IN ARGENTINA AND SHE WENT TO OAXACA IN NINETY SEVEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN AND WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THE MELDING OF PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES AND LIVING IN WHAT SHE PERCEIVED AS A HARMONY AND THEN OF COURSE BETWEEN NINETY SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED ALL KINDS OF VERY DRAMATIC THINGS WERE HAPPENING IN HER HOME COUNTRY OF ARGENTINA WHICH I IMAGINE INFLUENCED THIS TEXT OH AND THE BOOK IS CALLED SOUP OF GARLIC AND MEZCAL THE MIRROR DISROBING ANTERIOR MEMORY NOT REDUNDANT IN IT SHE CAN HOLD HER PRESENCE IN HANDS OF LOADED FLOWERS AND INVENTS A THOUSAND FORMS IN WHICH TO HOPE IN ROTATION THAT KIND OF EXCEEDING LIKE IDENTITY AND WORD THAT SHE MUST SAY NEWBORN TENTATIVE OR ANIMAL SHE CAN PULL PAIN FROM THE ROOT DROP BY DROP INTO HER TIME BOUND HEART WHERE SHE SAYS THAT SHE MUST SAY NEWBORN TENTATIVE OR ANIMAL SHE PUTS HER LIPS TO THE PAIN UNTIL SHE PULLS THE BODY SLOWLY FROM THE ROOT WHERE SHE SAYS SHE MUST HOLD A GREAT AIM THE PRESENCE OF WHICH DOES NOT YET EXIST WHERE SHE SAYS THAT SHE MUST SAY THE BODY OF HERSELF THAT REAPPEARS IN THE centre OF HER NAME SHE RELEASES WHERE SHE SAYS SHE MUST SAY SHE IS NOT CONSUMED WHERE SHE SAYS THAT SHE MUST NOT SAY THAT WHERE SHE SAYS I KISSED YOU ALL OVER SHE MUST ALSO SAY I ALWAYS LOVED YOU SHE WANT TO BANKRUPT HER SKIRT OF ITS CREASES AS IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY CREATURE SHOUTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DARK STUMBLING OVER SHADOW FALLS SHE SLIDES UNTIL SHE FINDS HER FEET AND GETS ON LACKING CONSCIOUSNESS AND EVERY SO OFT SHE IS ROCKED

PhillyTalks1_Complete-Discussion_10-31-97_UPenn A a 0.644 406.333 YOU EXPECT TO BE INSTRUCTED BY INSTRUCTIONS AND YOU do not GET VERY INSTRUCTED BY THEM YOU KNOW AND {they are / they were} VERY FRENCH IN THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} JUST SORT OF KIND OF LIKE FRENCH THEORY {you are / you were} LIKE READING ALONG AND YOU GO WHAT YOU KNOW CAN YOU RUN THAT BY ME AGAIN AND I LIKED THE WAY THE WIT THIS QUOTE WAS SIMILAR TO A LOT OF THE PIECES IN THERE IN THE SENSE THAT SYMMETRY IN IN MATH I A A SYMMETRICAL EQUATION I {it's / it is / it has} THE SAME IN BOTH DIRECTIONS YOU GO THOUGH ALL OF THESE PROCEDURES AND {it's / it is / it has} THE SAME SO NOTHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND BUT ALL THIS STUFF HAPPENS AND SO YOU START OUT WITH THE SAME THING AT EITHER END AND A AND I I WAS INTERESTED IN THAT IDEA SO {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF I {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF STASIS AND THEN SYMMETRY IS A KIND OF STASIS AND BUT {it's / it is / it has} A {it's / it is / it has} A KIND OF QUIVERY STASIS THAT is not REALLY STASIS BECAUSE IT JUST THEN IT SORT OF COLLAPSES AND THEN YOU HAVE A KIND OF ANTI STASIS SO THIS THIS QUOTE SEEMED TO DO THAT FOR ME IN A WAY THAT IT WAS INTERESTING AND THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK THAT YOU TAKE FROM IT IS A SENSE OF SYMMETRICALITY AND THAT PERSISTENCE IN THE SITUATION AND THAT RELATES TO MY READING OF DAVID WHICH IS TO SAY YOU JUST HAVE TO STARE INTO IT AND PERSIST %bcack SO I WAS JUST INTERESTED IN EVOKING THAT IT does not SEEM VERY EXPLANATORY AS A QUOTE IT SEEMS ANTI EXPLANATORY AND YET IT SEEMS KIND OF TO HAVE AN NUANCE TO I YOU KNOW NUMINOUS QUALITY TO IT I LIKED YEAH THAT WAS VERY CLEAR IN IN SO MANY POINTS TO JUST SAID THAT PARAGRAPH YEAH i am TAKING NOTES NOW {that's / that is / that has} {that's / that is / that has} WONDERFUL SO SO SO THINGS CHANGE ONLY THROUGH SOME COLLAPSE OF THE STASIS OF SYMMETRY WELL YE I IF ASYMMETRY AS YOU POINT OUT SYMMETRY AND NOT SYMMETRY ARE THE SAME SO AN ASYMMETRY ASS ASSUMES LACK OF SYMMETRY AND SO YOU KNOW THEY MAKE UP SYMMETRY YEAH X SO HOW DO YOU EVER GET TO CHANGE I MEAN HOW DOES ONE GET HOW DOES ONE HOW DOES ONE THINK THAT THROUGH SO THA HOW CAN ONE ARTICULATE THAT STATEMENT SO THAT CHANGE IS SO THAT THE FACT OF CHANGE IS ENCOMPASSED THINK OF DEATH YEAH {it's / it is / it has} CHANGED I MEAN {there's / there is / there has} {there's / there is / there has} SOMEBODY IN IN I WAS JUST IN BUFFALO AND SOMEBODY SAID ASKED ME A QUESTION AND IT WAS %bcack YEAH {what's / what is / what has / what does} YOUR POSITION ON CHANGE DO YOU THINK CHANGE IS GOOD OR ARE YOU AGAINST CHANGE X AND AND I I SAID IT JUST IT YOU WE do not HAVE A CHOICE AND IT JUST SNEAKS RIGHT UP ON YOU WHEN YOU JUST LEAST EXPECT IT AND CHANGES AND AND YO WHEN WHEN THINGS ARE BAD YOU W YOU THINK THAT CHANGE IS GOOD BECAUSE THINGS ARE BAD AND THINGS WILL CHANGE AND WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD YOU do not WANT THINGS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOOD AND CHANGE WOULD BE BAD %bcack BUT YOU ALWAYS WANT SOMETHING ELSE SO YOU WANT CHANGE BECAUSE YOU THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO GET BETTER THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER AND {it's / it is / it has} AMAZING THAT WE THINK THAT THEY ARE %bcack MY BOOK SAID THE SAME THING {it's / it is / it has} LIKE {that's / that is / that has} TRUE THAT IF THE news paper WOULD REVIEW THEM {they had / they would} CALL THEM BLEAK WELL YOU KNOW IF {you are / you were} NOT IF YOU do not THINK THINGS ARE BLEAK {you are / you were} NOT REALLY GRASPING {what's / what is / what has / what does} GOING ON YEAH YEAH WELL THAT KIND OF BRINGS UP FOR ME THE QUESTION OF THIS ONE MIGHT CALL THIS SOCIAL IMAGINARY OF USING A COUNTING SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE DAVID YOU WERE USING TEN LINES AND YOU KNOW {you are / you were} INVENTING THIS SORT OF COMBINATORY TWENTY POEMS TEN LINES EACH WITHIN VARIOUS COMBINATIONS IS THERE ANY ANYTHING THAT YOU ATTACHED TO %bcack %bcack OF SOME OF LARGER SOCIAL IMPORT TO THE USE OF THAT SORT OF COUNTING STRUCTURE OTHER THAN MERELY AS A AS A MEANS TO AN ENDING TO YOU NO ABSOLUTELY IT IT BEC every one COUNTS THE SAME %bcack every one IN THIS CULTURE COUNTS THE SAME SO I MEAN {we are / we were} AGREED ON TEN THEN TWENTY AND HOW YOU GET THERE YOU KNOW SO SO BECAUSE WELL {it's / it is / it has} HARD TO SINGLE ONE BOOK OUT BUT CERTAINLY THIS BOOK WAS CONCERNED WITH EPISTEMOLOGY AND HOW WHEN THE WORDS NEVER MEAN EXACTLY THE SAME THING FOR ANY ONE OF {us / u. s.} AS none the less OF SOCIETY IS POSSIBLE WHEREAS I WAS LOOKING FOR THINGS LIKE I WAS THINKING OF THINGS LIKE TEACHING CHILDREN TO READ TEACHING CHILDREN TO COUNT AND HOW THAT IS THERE AS SOME KIND OF OUTSIDE TO EACH ONE OF {us / u. s.} ALTHOUGH {it's / it is / it has} INSIDE {us / u. s.} YOU KNOW {that's / that is / that has} WHY {it's / it is / it has} OUTSIDE THERE {it's / it is / it has} INSIDE {us / u. s.} HERE AND I COULD SAY MORE ABOUT THAT BUT SEEMS MORE USEFUL TO KEEP RESPONSES TO LIKE A PARAGRAPH WHEN YOU SAID every one COUNTS THE SAME IN THIS CULTURE I THOUGHT BOY {that's / that is / that has} WAY NOT TRUE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MEANT SOME OF {us / u. s.} ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS OH NOT NO NO NO NO NO BUT THEY SHOULD {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT AND BUT YOU SEE YEAH BUT {that's / that is / that has} ALS BUT {that's / that is / that has} THE THE WAY YOU HEARD THAT STATEMENT IS ALSO CORRECT FOR THIS BOOK BECAUSE THERE I BELIEVE {there's / there is / there has} QUITE A BIT ABOUT SOCIAL INEQUITY IN THIS BOOK ALTHOUGH {it's / it is / it has} NOT CALLED BY THE USUAL TERMS JUST THAT THEY BECAUSE THEY HAD THEY HAD LENIN NOW they have GONE LIMP LIMP AFTER BEING SO SO LONG ENGORGED THAT THEY ARE NOW LIMP SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND REALLY FASCINATING ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS THAT IT ALLOWS ME AS A READER TO WATCH EACH OF YOU AS A WRITER TACKLING A NOT EXACTLY PARALLEL BUT {it's / it is / it has} THE CLOSEST THING TO IT PROJECT IN ESS IN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SPACE READING THE {other's / other is / other has} WORK AND THEN CONSTRUCTING SOMETHING TO SAY OUT OF THAT PROCESS AND I AM INTRIGUED THAT BOTH OF YOU TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER I WOULD SAY FLIRT WITH NARRATIVE IN AS THOUGH IT WERE BEHIND OR RELATED TO THE TEXT YOU PICKING THE FILM THAT I TAKE IT HAS NOT EVER SEEN EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW I WHICH IS SO SYMMETRICAL SINCE THE FILMMAKER HAS ALSO NOT SEEN THE FILM THAT HIS FILM WAS BASED ON LOTS THAT HE %bcack RIGHT AND

CONTEXT THE SECOND CREATES A CONTEXT IN EVERY DAY PRACTICE TRUTHS ARE DETECTED BY APPREHENDING CADENCES THESE ARE CONFIRMED BY A KIND OF SUBLIMINAL SOUNDING THAT EMPLOYS ASPECTS OF VISION AND TOUCH CHARM FURTHERS PROPAGATION THEY COULD INTERRUPT OR STOP ANYTHING BUT TRUE CELEBRATION CELEBRATION CEREBRATION COULD THIS HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ACT OF MENTAL FREEDOM PIERCE THE MEMBRANE BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY AND SOMETHING STARTS TO LEAK THEN FLOW HAPPINESS IS ALWAYS CONVENTIONAL IRRITATION SURPLUS STIMULATION WISDOM DOES IT CONSIST OF LITTLE MORE THAN ACCEPTING HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR SOMETHING TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN IF SATISFACTION IS THE MEASURE THIS IS EASY TO SEE PERFECTION IS A KIND OF SURFACE WHOLENESS MUST BE BOUNDED BY A SHELL OR SKIN TO BE A UNIT IS TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE AND AN INSIDE PLACE YOUR BETS THEN LAUGH AND THE GAME COMES TO AN END SO SOON IN CASE YOU MIGHT FORGET EXAGGERATE ADHERING TO THE WORLD BY MEANS OF GLUE IDEAS ARE USEFUL MAINLY WHEN {they are / they were} WET BUT THE DRY REMAINS FASCINATE REALITY IS LIKE A SEA THE WORLD CONTAINS MANY THOUGHTS AND FEW IMAGES o. k. i am GOING TO READ A FEW MORE JOURNAL SELECTIONS AND THEN BRUCE SANJO'S TURN SEVEN ELEVEN EIGHTY EIGHT IN ORDER TO LIVE AT THE PITCH OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE WE ACQUIRE THE ABILITY TO FORGO THE INTERVALS OF TIME THAT ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED TO CONSOLIDATE AND MAKE PART OF OURSELVES WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF {life's / life is / life has} POSSIBILITIES AND DEMANDS THERE IS LITTLE TIME FOR THIS THUS WE GRADUALLY HARDEN OURSELVES TO ACCOMMODATE REALITY AND EVEN FURTHER FORGET WHAT IT IS LIKE TO IMAGINE REALLY DIGESTING SOMETHING SEVEN THIRTEEN TIME OUT OF TIME THE MORE I AM HEARD THE MORE I MUST RESORT TO SILENCE TO BE HEARD THE FASTER I GO THE MORE STEALTHILY I MUST MOVE SEVEN FOURTEEN THE IMAGINATION FORTHRIGHTLY ENCOUNTERED CAN NEVER BETRAY AND WILL ALWAYS REVEAL FOR THIS KIND OF ENCOUNTER TO BE OPEN INTERNALLY how ever IS AS DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTLY AS RARE AS IN EXTERNAL ENCOUNTERS SEVEN EIGHTEEN LIFE PRESENTS ITSELF TO {us / u. s.} ALL AT ONCE AT ALL TIMES IN ITS ENTIRETY SEVEN TWENTY ONE IS IT POSSIBLE TO SURFACE UNCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF THE IDENTITY MAKING MECHANISM AND THEREBY EXPERIENCE THE NEXUS OF THE PERCEPT COLORING PROCESS I THINK THIS IS DONE AND CAN BE DONE AGAIN AND AGAIN IN NEW WAYS BY READING AND WRITING POETRY WHAT MAKES {us / u. s.} WHAT WE ARE IS DETERMINED BY WHAT MAKES {us / u. s.} SEE WHAT WE WANT TO SEE ON A SOCIAL LEVEL THE GRADUAL ASSERTION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS IS DETERMINED IN PART BY THE VALUE THAT THE SOCIETY PLACES ON THE INDIVIDUAL THIS VALUE NOT ONLY DETERMINES WHAT A SOCIETY CAN DO TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE TO SOCIETY IF ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE EQUAL ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS THEN EQUALLY EXPENDABLE ON THE OTHER HAND CAN AN INDIVIDUAL SHED SOCIETY AND THEREBY TRANSFORM IT THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALSO FOSTERED BY THE CONCEPT OF GENIUS IT MAY BE THAT GENIUS IS FOSTERED BY A MUTATION OF A {society's / society is / society has} ILLS WITH ITS STRENGTHS GENIUS HAS A WAY OF AFFECTING SOCIETY DEEPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS ASL ALWAYS THE PRODUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL ANOTHER ASPECT OF GENIUS IS THAT IT IS AN IDEA THAT RETURNS TO ALL INDIVIDUALS OF VALUE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HELPING RESHAPE SOCIETY JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE AGE OF MACHINES HAS INTIMIDATED HUMAN BEINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DEMONSTRATE THE IMMENSE POTENTIAL POWER OF NOT INDIVIDUALIZING EQUIVALENCE OF MASS PRODUCED PARTS SOCIETY IS TEMPTED TO IMITATE THE POWERFUL MACHINE BY MAKING ITS MEMBERS CONFORM TO THEIR WAYS TO PRODUCING SO UNIFORMLY OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL SOON realiseS THE VALUE IN LEARNING WHAT ARE THE ASPECTS OF NON RES REPRODUCIBILITY WHICH ARE A VALUE SEVEN TWENTY SIX ANXIOUS EMBATTLED SAME THING SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT i have LIVED WITH TIME SO LONG AS A LIMITING AND CONTROLLING REALITY THAT i am RUINED WITH THINKING OF IT LIKE THIS I NEED NEW IMAGES FOR TIME I AM TIRED OF BEING PUSHED IN FRONT OF IT LIKE A CHILD BEING URGED TO TAKE ITS FIRST STEP OR LIKE A PET BEING DRAGGED ALONG ITS STACCATO STEPS LURCHING FORWARD ONE MOMENT AND THEN SEEMING TO DRAG ON FOREVER LOCKED IN A ROOM WAITING FOR ITS CHANCE TO GET OUT I CAN LEARN TO ACCEPT A CONCEPT OF TIME THAT IS INEXORABLE LEADING TO ONE INESCAPABLE OUTCOME BUT I CAN NEVER ACCEPT A MECHANICAL VIEW OF TIME THAT ALLOWS FOR NO INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE EIGHT SEVENTEEN EVERY PLACE HAS ITS ELSEWHERE ITS neighbour NOT YET COMPLETELY KNOWN ITS STRANGE PART WE THINK OF THE KNOWN AS THE CONQUISTAD CONQUISTADOR OF THE UNKNOWN TWO FAST TERRAI TWO VAST TERRAINS EACH PITCHED IN DARKNESS ONE ADVANCING ON THE OTHER AND THE OTHER IN GRAVE RETREAT PROBABLY A MORE APROPOS PORTRAYAL SUCH AS MAY EXIST BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE let us SAY ALLOWS FOR A MORE DYNAMIC YET WEBBED RELATIONSHIP THAN THAT AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE TWO QUOTE SIDES ARE EXCHANGING SOMETHING VITAL TO BOTH LIKE A HOT POTATO THAT NEITHER COMPLETELY WANTS YET NEITHER CAN COMPLETELY GET RID OF EITHER OVER TIME THE RELATIONSHIP TRANSFORMS BOTH AT THE BOUNDARY POINT BETWEEN THE TWO THERE ARE LEAKS CLUSTERS OF ORIGINATION THAT MIGHT ERUPT BRIEFLY BUT FREQUENTLY AT THIS PERIPHERAL ZONE THEN MELT AWAY
PoemTalk-198_On-three-Larry-Price-poems A a 0.86 361.756 AND THAT THE WHOLE PERSONIFICATION THAT HAPPENS WITHIN YOUR WORK AND ESPECIALLY THEIRS {it's / it is / it has} TO SHOW THAT WHOSE MONOLOGUE IS IT SO TO SPEAK X INNER MONOLOGUE WHEN I ANY ONE IDEA STANDS ON STAGE FOR SEVEN SECONDS SO THE IDEA HAS some how BECOME THE PRESENTER OF THE MONOLOGUE {that's / that is / that has} E E {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT I MEAN THE QUESTION REALLY BECOMES WHY WHY ARE WE WRITING WHO IS IT {that's / that is / that has} WRITING WHY DID THAT START WRITING WHAT STARTED WRITING WHAT IS WRITING TO WHAT AND SO ON I MEAN THERE ARE ALL THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW IT AN I IS IT AN I AND i am NOT SO SURE THAT I WANT TO INVEST EVERYTHING THAT i am DOING IN ANY PARTICULAR PLACE ONE PLACE BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW TIME AND SPACE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMPLICATED AND I do not THINK THE WRITING COMES OUT OF ANY ONE PLACE I THINK IT COMES OUT OF THIS AS I SAID THIS MELANGE OF OF DEBRIS FORCES FACTORS OPERATORS {it's / it is / it has} YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} COMPLEX AND SO YOU HAVE i am REALLY INTERESTED IN BUT X BUT CURIOUSLY HERE YOU YOU THEN BUT YOU AND I ARE HERE NOW %bcack WELL I LOVE THAT TRYING TO BIND RIGHT I MEAN BUT {it's / it is / it has} AN ADDRESS YOU KNOW X X TO THE SUPPOSITION I I LOVE i will BE ANDY WARHOL i will BE IN OTHER WORDS {we are / we were} GOING TO TRY SO TRY SOME IDENTITY ON FOR SIZE %bcack I WILL BE AND YOU WILL BE every one X YOU BE YOU BE YOU BE OH I THOUGHT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT LIKE WALGREENS OR SOMETHING {it's / it is / it has} X OVER IN AISLE B X OH SORRY {that's / that is / that has} all right YOU CAN ADD A BIG THIS IS WHAT WE GET WITH BILL X {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT SO BUT {it's / it is / it has} NOT i will BE GEORGE PATTON i will BE SOME SOLID CHARACTER %bcack {it's / it is / it has} ANDY WARHOL COURSE ANDY WAS ACTUALLY A MIRROR YOU KNOW what ever YOU KNOW AND ANDY WAS NOT INTERESTED IN IDENTITY SELFHOOD AND SO IF YOU AND I ARE HERE NOW SEEMS LIKE A SOLID SOCI SOCIALITY YOU KNOW AN AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN BE MEANING WE CAN MAKE MEANING TOGETHER WE CAN COCREATE THIS THING {that's / that is / that has} HAPPENING HERE MAYBE IN THIS POEM AND THEN IN DOING SO i will BE ANDY WARHOL AND YOU BE every one ELSE WHAT we have ESTABLISHED IS A PERSONA THAT IS AN ANTIPERSONA AND SET AGAINST THAT IS A KIND OF AN ENTIRE AUDIENCE MAYBE every one WHO READS THIS POEM OR {who's / who is / who has} SITTING IN IN THE CROWD GETS TO BE every one ELSE BUT {it's / it is / it has} NOT DISTINCT FROM THE I BECAUSE I WILL BE NOTHING AND YOU WILL BE NOTHING ANTITED TALK ANTITED TALK SAY A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ANTITED TALK BECAUSE BECAUSE I THINK TED TALK I do not THINK THAT LARRY WAS THINKING OF TED TALK BUT THAT IS EVERYTHING {that's / that is / that has} WRONG WITH SPEAKING TO AN AUDIENCE YEAH I THINK {it's / it is / it has} DISLODGING MONOLOGUE FROM LIKE ITS AUTHORITARIANISM AND {it's / it is / it has} MAKING THE THE POEM'S EXISTENCE IS AN INVITATION FOR A CONNECTION BETWEEN AUDIENCE AND SPEAKER X SO {it's / it is / it has} NOT {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} INVITING THE COLlabourATION OF BOTH PARTS THAT CREATE THE OCCASION FOR MEETING ANYWAY {it's / it is / it has} NOT I TALK YOU LISTEN I KNOW YOU do not YES {it's / it is / it has} RIGHT IT SAYS WHICH COMES IN PARTS OF CERTAINTY THE MONOLOGUE does not HAVE {it's / it is / it has} CERTAIN BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIP NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE MONOLOGUE IS SAYING %bcack {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT BEFORE X WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE I AND I WAS DISOWNING THE I BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO OWN UP TO IT YOU HAVE TO SAY all right i will TAKE THIS ON FOR THIS MOMENT JUST FOR THE A ABSOLUTE FACT FACT OF CONNECTION AND {that's / that is / that has} NOT IRONIC IN THE LEAST {that's / that is / that has} ACTUALLY QUITE X WELL X X ETHICAL X ABSOLUTELY {it's / it is / it has} ETHICAL BUT IS IS IRONY UNETHICAL I do not THINK SO NO IT is not X BUT TH THE PROBLEM WITH TED TALK ISM IS THAT THEY S THE IMPLICATION IS WE NEED MORE THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME YOU KNOW WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONSERVATION YOU KNOW AND i have BEEN THROUGH THIS AND {you are / you were} AN AUDIENCE {who's / who is / who has} LISTENING TO ME AND {it's / it is / it has} USUALLY VERY PERSONAL AND VERY PHILOSOPHICAL BUT {it's / it is / it has} FACT FIFTEEN FUCKING MINUTES OF FAME A TED TALK {you are / you were} TRYING TO GET THROUGH S YOU WANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE {it's / it is / it has} MORE THAN THAT I THINK ABSOLUTELY AND AT I MEAN {there's / there is / there has} I MEAN X YES I {can not / cannot} SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT I MEAN I REALLY AGREE WITH WHAT {you are / you were} SAYING I THINK THAT YOU KNOW A AGAIN I we have GOT LOTS OF STRAW PEOPLE AROUND AND TH THEY WALK AROUND LOOKING AND SOUNDING VERY IMPORTANT ONLY BECAUSE WE ELECTED THEM AND YOU KNOW WE CAN JUST DISELECT THEM I THINK AND AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE GET TO LIKE TAKE UP ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT ROLES IN SOME KIND OF COOPERATIVE IN THIS CASE X YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} ALL STAGES OF DRAMA BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} EVERYWHERE THAT WE ARE SO BILL THOUGHT ANOTHER THOUGHT ON THIS PIECE BEFORE TURN TO THE THIRD ONE WELL X I LOVE THIS TYPICAL INVERSION THAT WE GET HERE BETWEEN A CROWD AND A EMPTY STAGE OR A STAGE AND AN EMPTY CROWD {that's / that is / that has} KIND OF UNFORTUNATE is not IT I MEAN I did not WANT TO IMPLY THAT THE CROWD WAS EMPTY ALTOGETHER EMPTY BUT I THINK THAT {there's / there is / there has} A POSSIBILITY {that's / that is / that has} A LOT OF TIMES IT IS BECAUSE THE CROWD COMES WITH EXPECTATIONS THAT INVEST THE PERFORMANCE WITH MORE SOLIDITY AND IMPORTANCE THAN IT ACTUALLY DESERVES AND TO ME THAT ALL THAT DOES IS EMPTY THE CROWD'S EXPECTATIONS ONTO THE STAGE WHERE THOSE EXPECTATIONS THEN ACT OUT I do not WANT THAT I WANT COMPLETE CONTINGENCY I WANT THE ACCIDENT THE UNPREDICTABLE I WANT TO Y YOU KNOW FEEL THAT THERE MIGHT BE ALL KINDS OF ENCOUNTERS THAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW AT ANY GIVEN TIME WE JUST NEED TO BE OPEN TO THAT X I THINK {that's / that is / that has}

Retalack-Selah-Smith-Stephens-Wilson_Complete-Recording_Body-As-Discourse_ADFEMPO_NYC_9-25-09 A a 0.098 487.866 I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT FOR LAURA SMITH ABOUT HER TALK AND {it's / it is / it has} A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT JOHN RETALACK SAID ABOUT THE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH RUPTURE RAPTURE OR THE TROUBLING NATURE OF FUSING THOSE TWO WHEN {you are / you were} LOOKING AND THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODIES THE VIOLENT STUDIES OF BODIES THE HISTORY OF BODIES IN RELATIONSHIP TO ONE ANOTHER PARTICULARLY SINCE YOU WERE DOING YOUR PIECE ON MICHAELA OLIVER AND SINCE { she's / she was / she is / she has} SPECIFICALLY INVOKING THE ISSUE OF OF NOT JUST THE ISSUE OF SLAVERY BUT THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE DONE TO BODIES THROUGH SLAVERY I do not KNOW YOU KNOW SAIDIYA HARTMAN SCENES OF SUBJECTION IN WHICH SHE TALKS ABOUT KIND OF %bcack THE NOT JUST THE KIND OF RUPTURE IN RELATIONSHIP TO BODIES BUT THE PLEASURE BRANDED IN THE IN THE IN VAR THE DANGEROUS FORMS OF PLEASURE AND i am WONDERING IF YOU COULD %bcack RIGHT THERE SPEAK TO HOW OBVIOUSLY YOU could not DO THAT IN A VERY SHORT PRESENTATION BUT HOW BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS PART OF YOUR WORK ON A LARGER PROJECT HOW DOES YOUR WORK DEAL WITH WHEN YOU PUT THOSE THINGS TOGETHER IN CONVERSATION HOW DOES IT DEAL WITH THOSE WITH THE TROUBLING DIMENSIONS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT ABANDONING YOUR INTEREST IN EXPLORING OLIVER'S WORK IN THIS WAY I MEAN I I I THINK THAT MY ANSWER TO THAT AND AND MY RESPONSE TO THE THE LINK BETWEEN RUPTURE AND i am SORRY RAPTURE AND ITS RELIGIOUS CONNOTATIONS ARE ARE ARE THE SAME AND AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT i am SO INTERESTED IN IN WHAT I SEE AS OLIVER'S REPURPOSING OF THE IDEA OF RAPTURE IT SO EMBODIED IN HER VERSION AND I AND I THINK IT SECULARIZED AND I AND I S I SEE THIS I i have BEEN SEEING THIS ACROSS SUCH A LOT OF QUEER AND TRANS WORK %bcack THAT i am SEEING THESE VER VERY RADICAL TRENDS BODILY IDENTIFICATIONS THAT ARE VARYINGLY LOCATED VERY RACED VERY GENDERED VERY SPECIFIC VERY AWARE OF BOUNDARIES WHILE THEY TRANSGRESS AND AND I AND {that's / that is / that has} INTENSELY PARADOXICAL BUT I THINK THAT AND AND I AND I I DO THINK THAT {there's / there is / there has} THIS CRUX ABOUT TRANS ILLNESS THAT THAT WORK IS THINKING ABOUT AND THINKING ABOUT SO SO SOMETHING THAT FEELS VERY PARADOXICAL BETWEEN LOCATEDNESS AND RELATIONALITY %bcack BUT I DO THINK THAT THE METAPHOR OF OF RAPTURE GETS LOCAL IT GETS SECULAR AND IT GETS EMBODIED NOW I WANTED TO NOTICE SOMETHING AND MAYBE HAVE SOME PEOPLE COMMENT ON IT I WAS CURIOUS IN MY NOTES ON JOAN'S TALK WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE SEGUE IN JOAN'S TALK I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN ALTER ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF AND THE NEXT THING I I HAVE WRITTEN DOWN IS RECIPROCAL ALTERITY NOW HAVING RE ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF HAS BEEN COMMENTED ON BY BY NATHALIE NATHANAEL BODY STUFFED FULL OF MIND SUGGESTS ALTERITY BY TRISH INCLUDING IN THE LAST COMMENT ABOUT A TRANCE LIKE AMENITY GOING TOWARDS TRANSCENDENCE TOO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF AND IN BY REYNALDO IN A WAY IN ONE OF THE ACQUAINTANCES ON LEATHER AND FISHNET A AND SO I WAS WONDERING HOW WHEN YOU HAVE ALTERITY WITHIN THE SELF WHICH IS PATENT AND LIKE BEEN PLAYED OUT AND AND COMMENTED ON ONE ALSO CAN PRODUCE A RECIPROCAL ALTERITY WITH THE OTHER BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF THE PLAYERS HAVE MULTIPLIED %bcack THAT IS IF EVERY SELF HAS ALTERITIES OF VARIOUS KINDS AND THE ETHICAL GOAL IS RECIPROCAL ALTERI RECIPROCAL ALTERITY {it's / it is / it has} {there's / there is / there has} BEEN A A TO MORPH INTO A POLYNEME A POLYVALENT SPACE THIS IS VERY VERY INTERESTING AND {that's / that is / that has} WHAT I HAD NOTICED IN THE TERMS OF A R OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM DO THIS A LOT OF THINGS NEED TO BE SAID AND I WONDERED WHETHER IF ANYONE ELSE NOTICED IT THEY WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON IT THAT IS THE AMPLE PROBLEM WITH SIMPLE ALTERITY WHEN ONE IS FISSURED INTO WRITING PRAISE JUST THE SMALL MATHEMATICAL QUESTION YOU KNOW SUBJECT TO OTHER SUBJECT AT ALTERITY WITHIN THE SUBJECT AND SUBJECT RIGHT OTHER ABJECT AND I TH AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WITH REGARDS TO THE LEVINAS IN QUESTION OF YOU KNOW THE FEMININE AND AND THE OTHER AND {that's / that is / that has} THEN BECOMING CONFOUNDED WITH WOMEN AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WOMEN THAT OCCUPY THE MASCULINE RELATION TO THE FEMININE THEN SORT OF FRAMING WHAT IS LEFT OUT OF THAT AS ACTUALLY AND IN BETWEEN A SORT OF DESTROYED GROUND WHICH MIGHT BE THE ENEMY THE PALESTINIAN FOR LEVINAS IT MIGHT BE IT IT MIGHT BE THE UNMARKED THE UNRECLAIMABLE BODY AND THAT AND SO FOR ME THE ETHICAL QUESTION HAD LESS TO DO WITH THE CONSTITUENT OF MISRECOGNITION BETWEEN OUR OWN ALTERITY AND OTHERS WHICH IS AN ASYMMETRICAL LANDSCAPE AND AND {we are / we were} NEGOTIATING BUT THE FURTHER VIOLENCE OF AN UNMARKED TERRAIN WHICH ENABLES EVEN PLOTTING SELF OTHER YEAH X %bcack YEAH SO PUTTING THE THIRD IN IS REALLY PUTTING A THIRD'S ATTRITION WITHIN YEAH %bcack WHICH IS ACTUALLY NOT NOT A DIALECTIC BUT IS {it's / it is / it has} NOT THE THE DIA BUT {it's / it is / it has} SOME OTHER SPACE {that's / that is / that has} VERY INTERESTING YEAH A LITTLE BIT YEAH YEAH %bcack YEAH {that's / that is / that has} { he's / he was / he is / he has} LOVED FOR THAT TIME %bcack {it's / it is / it has} GREAT NO I D I do not HAVE ANY DISAGREEMENT WITH {what's / what is / what has / what does} JUST BEEN SAID I I THINK THAT THE MOMENT ONE recogniseS AN ALTERITY WITHIN {one's / one is / one was / one has} SELF ONE IS %bcack RECOGNIZING THE RECIPROCITY OF ALL ALTERITY BECAUSE ALTERITY IS NOT ONLY ABOUT OTHERS OUTSIDE OF ONESELF AND I DO THINK THAT THE VECTORS OF ALTERITIES GO IN IN MANY DIRECTIONS THAT THAT IN ITSELF IS IS NOT A VERY FULL STATEMENT BUT IT BUT IT LEADS TO THE QUESTION OR IT RAISES QUESTIONS OF THE NATURE OF PRACTICES WITHIN A A WORLDSCAPE WHERE YOU CAN BE MAPPING RECIPROCAL ALTERITIES RATHER THAN MAPPING LESS THAN ALTERITIES IN THE %bcack YEAH %bcack X %bcack I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT NOW THING I THINK i am GOING TO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE THAT THAT IS HOW YOU GET THERE BUT I THINK A AN AWFUL LOT TO SAY IS POSSIBLE TO recognise WITNESS WITHIN THEMSELVES AND NOT RELATE TO STILL BE ABLE TO LIKE TO THE OTHER AND NOT AND NOT RELATE YOU KNOW NOT {that's / that is / that has} RIGHT NOT MOVE IN THAT WAY THAT WE WE LIKE WE HAVE THE IDEAL EPIDURAL RELATIONSHIP SO ONE CAN SAY YOU KNOW I recognise THIS ME AND THAT ME AND NOT YOU YOU KNOW YEAH YEAH FOR SURE FOR SURE YEAH {they are / they were} NOT SUPPOSED TO GET DOWN I LOVE THAT THING YEAH VALERIE NO I THINK {it's / it is / it has} AGAIN I THINK {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THOSE NECESSARILY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT MEN {they are / they were} NOT NOT VERBS THAT THAT YOU YOU CERTAINLY CAN recognise OTHER THAN {what's / what is / what has / what does} WITHIN YOURSELF AND {you had / you would} BE BLIND TO OTHERS PERIOD BUT IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DYNAMIC OF RECIPROCATION

A YELLOW MUFFLER TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT IS SINGING LOUDLY TO HIMSELF A SPANISH SONG IN MY COUNTRY HE SAYS IN ENGLISH SING ALL THE TIME MONEY SING NO MONEY SING THEN HE ADDS STACCATO AS

INDIGNATION OF OWNER AND WAIT AROUND HIS FACE GIRL TAKES OFF THE HAT HE DOES NOT HAVE AND LOOKS EARNESTLY INTO THE EYES OF A GIRL THAT is not THERE THEN SMILES AND LOOKS ASIDE COYLY NO MONEY AND HE TURNS AWAY IN DISGUST TRAGIC TRAGIC TRAGIC I do not KNOW I HAS X i will CONTINUE WITH THIS AND MOVE HERE ABOUT A MINUTE BUT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO READ ABOUT PEOPLE I WONDER IF I CAN READ ABOUT A DOG THIS IS SOMEWHAT LONGER THE HIGHWAY I WAS WALKING ON WENT THROUGH A MARSH THERE WERE NO HOUSES NOTHING BUT THE MAR NO ONE ELSE WAS WALKING ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE BLAZING SUN I SAW THE DOG A HUNDRED FEET AWAY A BURLY FELLOW HALF CHOW I THOUGHT HALF GERMAN SHEPHERD SHAGGY HAIR PLASTERED WITH MUD THE DOG SAW ME TOO AND CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME I WALKED ON AFRAID THE DOG WOULD BITE I COULD HEAR THE NAILS OF HIS PAWS CLICKING ON THE PAVEMENT BUT HE PASSED ME NEVER LOOKED AT ME AND RAN ALONG AS I WALKED TEN OR TWENTY FEET AHEAD TEN OR TWENTY FEET BEHIND I DID NOT LIKE HIS LOOKS AT ALL THE HEAVY BROW THE SQUARE JAWS A SHAGGY DIRTY FELLOW THE ROAD WAS AS LONELY AS EVER MARSH UNDER THE BLAZING SKY AND THE MOTORCARS WENT SPEEDING PAST I COULD SEE THE PAVEMENT OF THE STREET ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THE BRIGHT BLUE SEA IT WOULD BE COOLER THERE AND I MIGHT BE RID OF THE DOG THE DOG LOOKED UP AFTER A WHILE SAW ME ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HE CAME TOWARDS ME STRAIGHT THROUGH THE TRAFFIC I STOOD STOCK STILL WAITING FOR THE DOG TO BE HIT SURE ENOUGH THE SECOND OR THIRD CAR STRUCK HIM AND SENT HIM SPRAWLING ON HIS BACK SQUEALING THE BRAKES OF THE CAR SCREECHED THE DOG LEAPED TO HIS FEET WAS KNOCKED DOWN AGAIN AND THEN CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME YOU DOPE I SAID BUT I WAS TOUCHED AT HIS DEVOTION NOW WE WENT ON SIDE BY SIDE THE DOG CLOSE TO ME AND I NO LONGER AFRAID NOW AND THEN WE CAME TO A STAIRWAY LEADING TO THE BEACH BELOW OTHER DOGS WHO WERE RUNNING ABOUT ON THE SAND AND THE DOG WAS EAGER TO GO DOWN BUT HE STOPPED WAITING FOR ME AT THE HEAD OF EACH STAIRWAY AND AS I WENT ON FOLLOWED THE STREET TURNED AT LAST AND WE WERE BACK ON THE HIGHWAY NOW I WAS AFRAID TO CROSS FOR FEAR THE DOG WOULD BE HIT HE STOOD BESIDE ME LOOKING UP AT ME WATCHING MY HANDS AND FEET READY TO SPRING FORWARD AT LAST THERE WAS A BREAK IN THE TRAFFIC ONLY TWO CARS COMING I COULD CROSS EASILY GO PART OF THE WAY LET THE CARS PASS AND THEN CROSS OVER BUT I WAS AFRAID THE DOG WOULD RUSH ON AND BE HIT NO I SAID OH NO AND WE WALKED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY with out CROSSING AS THE DOG RAN ON BESIDE ME STURDY AND TRUE I THOUGHT OF HIS LIFTED FACE THE DEEP BROWN EYES WATCHING MINE YES I SHOULD LIKE TO KEEP HIM WALKING SO TOGETHER WE CAME TO SOME HOUSES THESE WERE AT THE SEA COTTAGES REFRESHMENT STANDS EVEN A SMALL MERRY GO ROUND I STOPPED AT A STAND WHAT SHOULD I GET MY DOG TO EAT I ASKED THE PLEASANT GIRL BEHIND THE COUNTER SHE SMILED AT ME AND LEANED OVER THE COUNTER TO SMILE AT THE DOG AS HE STOOD BESIDE ME WAGGING HIS TAIL HAMBURGER SHE SAID DOGS LOVE IT all right ONE OR TWO TWO SHE TOOK THE FRESH CAKES OUT OF THE ICEBOX AND PUT THEM ON A SQUARE OF WAX PAPER I WALKED TO THE CORNER OF THE STAND THE DOG FOLLOWED AND I PUT THE MEAT DOWN THE DOG LOOKED AT IT HIS TAIL DROOPED HIS EYES WERE GLAZED WITH FEAR AND HE WAS OFF AS FAST AS HE COULD GO BOLTING OVER THE SAND HILLS {that's / that is / that has} ABOUT IT NOW I LATE THE I HAVE DONE I THINK AS YOU HEARD THE YOUNG LADY READ SOME THINGS THAT I CALL TESTIMONY NOW THE FIRST TWO I DID WITH THIS NAME OR IN THIS ARE THE WATERS IN MANHATTAN NOW THEY ARE BASED THE TESTIMONY ARE ALL BASED ON CASES IN THE LAW REPORTS AND THIS IS THE FIRST THERE THAT I USED OF THE TWO THE COMPANY HAD ADVERTISED FOR MEN TO UNLOAD A STEAMER ACROSS THE RIVER IT WAS SIX OH CLOCK IN THE MORNING SNOWING AND STILL DARK THERE WAS A CROWD LOOKING FOR WORK ON THE DOCK AND ALL THE WHILE MEN HURRIED TO THE DOCK THE MAN AT THE WHEEL KEPT THE BOW KEPT THE BOW EXCUSE ME he will LAUNCH AGAINST THE DOCK THE ENGINE RUNNING SLOWLY AND THE MEN KEPT JUMPING FROM DOCK TO DECK FROM DOCK TO DECK JOSTLING EACH OTHER AND CROWDING INTO THE CABIN EIGHTY OR NINETY MEN WERE IN THE CABIN AS THE LAUNCH PULLED AWAY THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE CABIN AND NO ROOM TO TURN who ever WAS SITTING DOWN COULD NOT GET UP AND who ever HAD HIS HAND UP COULD NOT GET IT DOWN AS LAUNCH RAN IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE ICE ICE CRACKING AGAINST THE LAUNCH THUMPING AND SCRAPING AGAINST THE LAUNCH BANGING UP AGAINST IT UNTIL IT STRUCK A SOLID CAKE OF ICE ROLLED TO ONE SIDE AND SLOWLY GAINED BACK TO AN EVEN KEEL THE MEN BEGAN TO FEEL WATER RUNNING AGAINST THEIR FEET AS IF FROM

IT IS UNINTENTIONAL ON HOMOPHONIC TERRAIN WHICH OR WITCH SOMETHING TRAILS ALONG AFTER THEM SLIGHT BUT NOT DWINDLING WHILE THE WATER LAPS AT THE LIPS NOW AWAY AND NOW OPEN ONE A PORTAL AND THE OTHER A SPELL AND THIS IS A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND I I WAS C CERTAIN THAT I WAS WRITING FICTION BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD SINCE THAT IT IS NOT FICTION THIS IS AS CLOSE TO FICTION AS I BELIEVE I CAN COME {it's / it is / it has} CALLED CROW AND ROBIN NEARBY I HEAR THE SOUND OF WOOD PLANKS CLUNKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THROUGH THE TREES COMES THE CLACK OF HAMMERS some timeS A BUZZSAW THE MAN LAUGHS AND SAYS HAVE YOU EVER MURDERED A MAN HIS co worker MAKES NO REPLY THE MAN BEGINS TO SING A SONG BUT STOPS INTERRUPTING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN LAUGHTER AT HOME I SIT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE AND LOOK OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE neighbour'S GARDEN I THINK ABOUT YOU RATHER I IMAGINE THAT I AM YOU WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE OF THE RAGGED PEONIES AND WHY THE neighbour WHY has not THE neighbour CUT THEM BACK AS THEY DIE FROM INSIDE YOUR BODY HOW DO PEONIES SMELL I AM EMBARRASSED BY THE LIMITS OF IMAGINATION THAT IS HOW MY DESIRE FAILS AS EMPATHY AND SETTLES INTO VOYEURISM HAVE YOU EVER DEADHEADED A PEONY I WANT TO KNOW NOT HOW THE OLD FELTED BROWNING PETALS FEEL BUT HOW THEY FEEL TO YOUR FINGERTIPS I WONDER IF {i had / i would} ASK A STRANGER AS YOU MUST ULTIMATELY BE A QUESTION ARISING OUT OF GENUINE CURIOSITY I WONDER IF {i had / i would} DARE TO TRESPASS INTO MY neighbour'S FLOWERBED AND CUT DOWN HER UGLY USED UP FLOWERS ACROSS THE STREET GRIFFIN GRIFFIN IS THREE AND A HALF HE WALKS TO THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY HOLDING A BOUNCY BALL HE AIMS CAREFULLY AND THEN SETS THE BALL DOWN TO ROLL IT THE BALL ROLLS EVENLY GRIFFIN'S ONE YEAR OLD SISTER TOTTERS CAREFULLY TOWARD HER BROTHER ON HER NEW WALKING LEGS THE BALL CONNECTS WITH HER SHINS BRINGING HER TO HER KNEES HER FACE BOUNCES DOWN AND THEN OFF THE BALL GRIFFIN RETRIEVES THE BALL AND WALKS BACK TO THE EDGE OF THE DRIVEWAY STARTING AGAIN GRIFFIN HONEY CALLS A BABYSITTER GRIFFIN I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY BUT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR TWO BIRDS SQUABBLE ONE IS A ROBIN AND THE OTHER LOOKS TO BE A CROW BIG AND AGGRESSIVE THE ROBIN IS GETTING BEAT UP BUT STANDS ITS GROUND A HUGE GUST OF WIND CAUSES THE BOUGH TO MOVE FROM DUE NORTH TO DUE EAST THE BIRDS ROTATE BEFORE MY EYES PARALLEL WITH ME THE WIND CARRIES THE PACKAGE OF ITSELF ON THE ARGUING BIRD VOICES UNTIL A PEDESTRIAN WALKS BY AND THE CROW IS STARTLED SLIDES OFF THE BOUGH AND GOES AWAY I WANTED THE CROW TO BE ASHAMED TO LEAVE THE BRANCH ASHAMED THAT IT HAD FORCED ITSELF ON ANOTHER BIRD'S HOME THEN I realiseD THAT I AM THE CROW AND YOU ARE THE ROBIN AND A SENSE OF ADORATION AND ADMIRATION SPREADS THROUGH ME LIKE A NEW VERSION OF THE WEATHER THE CROW COMES BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN AND I HEAR THE RAISED VOICES OF THE BIRDS MERGING WITH THE BIGGER AGITATED VOICE OF THE WIND IS IT REALLY WRONG TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE THAT WILL PROVE WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE ANYWAY I OFTEN FIND WHAT i am LOOKING FOR ON A CHAIN OF CONTINUITY THE LEADING TO OR FOLLOWING FROM HERE IN THE SEQUENCE OF REASON PROOF THAT THINGS MAY BE CONNECTED OFF KILTER with out THERE ARE REALIZING THE LINK THIS MORNING AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO I HEARD THIS STORY A SEMI TRUCK IS PULLING OUT OF A GAS STATION DRIVEWAY JUST AS IT PULLS OUT ONTO THE STREET A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR ROLLS IN FRONT OF IT AND GETS STUCK IN THE GRILL OF THE TRUCK THE TRUCK DRIVER DRIVES FOUR MILES AT SPEEDS OF UP TO FIFTY MILES PER HOUR COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF HIS FRONT LOADED PASSENGER WHEN THE TRUCK FINALLY STOPS THE WHEELCHAIR IS DETACHED FROM THE TRUCK AND ITS OCCUPANT IS UNHARMED HE DESCRIBES THE EXPERIENCE AS QUITE A RIDE THAT WAS ON NPR TOO I WILL SAY COULD THERE BE MORE TO THE CROW THAN ITS OBNOXIOUSNESS does not IT TOO HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HUNGRY TO NEED SHELTER I WATCH IT TRYING TO GET ITS GLOSSY HEAD INTO THE BIRD FEEDER MEANT FOR FINCHES AND SPARROWS VERY SMART IF I WERE THE STAND IN FOR THE CROW THEN COULD I CONVINCE SOMEONE TO LOVE ME I IMAGINE WATCHING YOU WATCH THE CROW YOUR GOOD HUMOR BUT YOUR SENSE ULTIMATELY THAT THIS BIRD IS NOT SUBTLE A PEST YOU THINK IT SHOULD BLOW AWAY IN A SUMMERY GUST COMING HOME FROM WORK I SEE MY YOUNG neighbour GRIFFIN RUNNING UP THE EMPTY SIDEWALK LOOKING BACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS THOUGH I THINK WITH AMUSEMENT THERE WAS SOMEONE FOLLOWING HIM I AM RAKING UP THE FALLEN MESS OF LEAVES AND STICKS IN THE YARD WHEN I NOTICE THAT THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR IS CARRYING STICKS AND BRANCHES OUT TO THE CURB WE BOTH CONTINUE with out ACKNOWLEDGING EACH OTHER AFTER A WHILE I SEE THE MAN ACROSS THE STREET SAWING OFF A HALF BROKEN BRANCH FROM A TREE AND THEN THAT ANOTHER neighbour IS SILENTLY RAKING UP DEBRIS FROM THE STORM FAR DOWN THE STREET SOME DAY labourERS ARE TALKING ANIMATEDLY IN SPANISH OTHERWISE THERE ARE NO HUMAN VOICES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I WAKE UP TO TERRIFIED SCREAMING ONE CREATURE PREYS UPON ANOTHER AND AFTER THE SCREAMS QUITE NEAR THE WOUNDED ANIMAL TAKES UP A DESPERATE SNORING BREATHING I TURN ON THE PORCH LIGHT AND THE BREATHING STOPS THEN STARTS AGAIN MORE IRREGULAR I {can not / cannot} SEE WHAT IS OUT THERE EVEN THOUGH THE SOUND OF IT IS SO SHARP THAT {it's / it is / it has} IN MY NOSTRILS AND ON MY TONGUE I WISH YOU WERE HERE TO COMFORT ME BUT I MAKE MY FEAR CORRECT ITSELF I WOULD BE YOU THE SELF AT A LOSS THE

IN SILENCE THIS has not HAPPENED BEFORE THE GRASSHOPPER IS INVISIBLE AND THE MAN PUTS HIS MEMBER INTO IT THE HALVES THAT are not SEEN IN THE DARK THESE MEN WHO ARE COUSINS ARE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO WERE NOMADS FOR THE JOY OF IT TO HAVE A JOB SO AS TO LEAVE IT COMES FROM THIS THIS IS A WAY OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE ARE NO MARRIAGES OR CONNECTIONS THOUGH THERE ARE CHILDREN CATCHING UP TO THE HENNAED MAN WHOSE HEAD IS HANGING OUT OF THE SACK FLIPPERING HEAD TO HEAD ON THE DESERT {it's / it is / it has} HANGING FROM THE COCOON SWAYING ON POLES ON WHICH THE STICK STARVING BOYS ARE STRUGGLING THERE IS NO MINUTE MOVEMENT LAYING THEM OUT ON A MAT DABBED TO CLEAN THEM THOUGH THE HENNAED MAN IS THE ONE DEAD {who had / who would} BEEN ALIVE FOR ONLY AN INSTANT AND THEY WHO are not WRAPPED HIM AND ARE MOVING WITH HIM TOWARD THE BILLOWS OF FIRE ON THE PLAIN THAT OR SPIRALS THEY ARE NOT MOVING TO ONE OF THESE THE SWANS FLAP UP HONKING OR HOOPING AS {they are / they were} COMING SHIMMERING IN A V ON ITSELF SO {they are / they were} SIMPLY THE THIN TOPAZ AIR THE DESERT IS CRISSCROSSED WITH A FEW ROADS FROM ABOVE THE MAN LOVING CELEBRITIES AND THE WIFE ARE IN A CAR THAT HAS BROKEN DOWN ON ONE OUT THERE THEY GET OUT AND ARE STANDING BESIDE IT WHICH IS PUSHED OUT AND IS BURNING IN FRONT OF THEM AND {there's / there is / there has} NOTHING INSIDE THEM THE MUSCULAR MOVEMENT IS COMING FROM SOME BLACK ROBES BLOWING WITH NO EYEHOLES THAT OR OUTSIDE THEM THE MAN AND THE WIFE {who's / who is / who has} WEEPING WITH THE BURNING CAR OUTSIDE THEM { he's / he was / he is / he has} QUIET is not JEERING FROM INSIDE MOVEMENT FROM IN HIM STANDING THE DESERT IS OUTSIDE THEM AND THE MOON IS {it's / it is / it has} OUT IN FRONT OF THEM SO THAT {it's / it is / it has} IN IT BRIGHT MOON IS IN FRONT OF THEM IN THE DESERTS {that's / that is / that has} ON FIRE THE BLACK ROBES BLOW OUT ON IT NOT IN THE LINE OF THE SPIRALS {they are / they were} GOING AT A TRAJECTORY WITH NO MOVEMENT IN THEM I WANT SO MUCH TO BE W WHERE I WAS BEFORE I WAS ME TRYING TO BE IN THE NIGHT AS DAY PUSHED OUT AND SO IT IS IN THE DAY WHEN IT IS NIGHT THE MOON IS IN FRONT IT IS ON THE PLANE THE MOON IS IN FRONT OF ME SO THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN ME YET ON THE RIM THE GIRL SPITS ON ME FOR A FLICKER THE GIRL SPITTING ON ME HER BEING SO IMMATURE THAT THE FRIENDS STARE AT ME CREATING A CONFORMITY TO WHICH IF I OBJECT i am MERELY SELF SERVING IT IS INVALIDATED BY HAVING OCCURRED IN ME TO BE WHAT I AM BEFORE I AM ME IT IS PUSHED OUT IN THE MOON IN FRONT WHICH IS BEFORE RATHER THAN ME LOOKING AT THE DOG LYING IN THE GUTTER WHOSE THIN LAYER OF SHEATH OF FAT IS SEEN ON THE RIBCAGE WHICH IS OPEN THE FRIENDS CREATE THIS CONFORMITY WITH IS LIMPID OCCURRING BEFORE THEY do not HAVE FACES STARING WHY DID ONE SEE THEM BEFORE {they had / they would} SAY IT IS SELF SERVING TO SEE THIS AND SO ANTICIPATING BREATHING IN AND OUT THE BREATH IS IN THE MOON THAT IS OUT SIDE IN FRONT IT is not IN ME SO IT does not MATTER IF ONE IS WALKING IT IS IN THE TREES THAT ARE IN THE BLUE SKY BIRDS GO BY SO THE DAY IS IN THE NIGHT AT ONCE I FELT JOYFUL THESE EVENTS HAPPENED SLOWLY BEFORE ME { he's / he was / he is / he has} HOLDING THE TIPS OF THE RIBCAGE LIKE FINS AND THE MEMBER PUT IN THE END COMES HAD BEEN ON IT IT OCCURS IN THE PRESENT BUT BEFORE ME SEEING ON THE STREET THE BLUE BURNISHED FACE BANGED UP WALKING I FOLLOWED

Scalapino-Leslie_Complete-Recording_Lecture-And-Discussion_Buffalo_3-7-91 A a 0.16 547.566 TO A MOMENT OR LIKE A MOMENT W WANTING TO LIKE CONTINUE IT JUST A LITTLE LONG LONGER AS A UNIFYING TIME CAPSULE A KIND OF PRESSING THAT KIND OF PRESSING THAT THAT BOB WAS DESCRIBING AS THE PRESSURE OF O'HARA LIKE HE WANTS TO HAVE A MOMENT WHICH IS KIND OF VAGUE WHEN YOU READ IT LIKE ON THE PAGE YEAH BUT YET AS YOU SAID BEFORE IN RELATION TO THE POEMS IT LIKE IT OCCURS QUICKLY AS A PROCESSION BUT AS RECORDED IT SEEMS TO some how WANT TO JUST PUSH THE LIMITS OF WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND YOU ALSO USE THE EXPRESSION RESONANCE AND DURATION I THINK THAT THAT IS SORT OF A KIND OF A OH BOY A CHARACTERIZATION OF THIS MOMENT RIGHT WELL {it's / it is / it has} THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE FACT THAT YOU CAN APPREHEND AN HUGE AMOUNT BUT YOU C BUT IN ORDER TO WRITE THAT TO SAY IT I IS IT C IN THE A AND THE FACT THAT {you are / you were} X U IF {you are / you were} UNABLE TO WRITE THAT WOULD BE {it's / it is / it has} IMPOSSIBLE AND ALSO THAT YOUR PERCEPTION OR YOUR BEING IN THE MOMENT THE MOMENT does not EXIST ANYWAY SO {it's / it is / it has} ATTEMPTING TO TO realise THAT IN OTHER WORDS THAT you have COMPLETELY FABRICATED THIS AND YOUR SENSE OF THE MOMENT IT HAS NEVER EXISTED AND IT is not THERE SO I RELATE THAT TO THAT PREVIOUS QUESTION OF WHETHER {something's / something is / something has} BEING NULLIFIED IN A SENSE THERE IS THAT THAT IT HAS TO BE YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU CAN ONLY EXIST IN THE PRESENT BUT {you are / you were} NEVER IN IT AND THAT IT AND THAT YOU {can not / cannot} AND THAT IT does not EXIST ANYWAY SO YOU do not WANT TO BE LIMITED BY THE BOUNDARIES OF A COHERENCE SO THAT ITSELF IS I WOULD SAY does not EXIST RIGHT WELL {it's / it is / it has} KIND OF AS IF IF YOU HAD THE MOMENT AS A FRAME SO TO SPEAK IF THAT MADE ANY SENSE THAT YOU WOULD THE THE THE WRITING WILL GO PAST IT WILL KIND OF GO PAST THAT BOUNDARY AND IT WILL SHOW YOU THAT {it's / it is / it has} PAST THAT BOUNDARY BY BEING SO BIG OR THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IT DEMONSTRATES THAT TENSION OF BEING INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF SOMETHING {it's / it is / it has} IS IT ALSO ILLUSORY BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} AN EXAMPLE OF LIKE WHAT you have BEEN TALKING ABOUT FABRICATING A SENSE OF THE MOMENT OR A CONSTRUCT OF THE MOMENT OUT OF THE PAST OUT OF WHAT YOU REMEMBER IS THAT IS THAT RELEVANT IS THAT RELEVANT TO YOUR I MEAN ONCE YOU GET PAST THE MOMENT {you are / you were} STILL WRITING THAT MOMENT HAS PASSED {you are / you were} IN A SENSE REMEMBERING SOMETHING OR WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN THAT MOMENT WAS TAKING PLACE WHICH STILL IS IS YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} NOT POSSIBLE YES U RIGHT BUT YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE {it's / it is / it has} SIMP IT IS SIMPLY THAT THAT YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE BEHIND TIME EVEN IF {you are / you were} SITTING RIGHT HERE TIME {there's / there is / there has} NO SUCH THING BECAUSE {you are / you were} NOT IF {you are / you were} IN S IN THE SECOND Y {it's / it is / it has} ALREADY BEHIND YOU i am i am INTERESTED IN THIS THIS WHOLE IDEA OF CONSTRUCTING O OF OF CONSTRUCTING SOME KIND O OF OH LINGUISTIC SURFACE OR A POEM OUT OF THE PAST OUT OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} YOU KNOW OUT OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} REMEMBERED IN A SENSE THE IMAGES LIKE YOU KNOW HERE ARE NOT NULLIFIED BECAUSE {they are / they were} STILL {they are / they were} STILL SOMETHING LEFT OVER AND AND THAT IS JUST A SENSE OF OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEEN CONSTRUCTED OUT OF WHAT WHAT HE REMEMBERS i am STRUGGLING WITH IT A LOT BECAUSE i am HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME TRYING TO ARTICULATE WHAT i am THINKING ABOUT AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS A LOT IN TERMS OF MY WORK W IN THE POETRY OF JOHN ASHBERY WHICH I THINK HAS A LOT WHICH THE DISCUSSION TODAY OF O'HARA'S POEM HAS A LOT OF OF RESONANCE WITH I SEE HIM AS ALSO CONSTRUCTING THIS THIS KIND TH THIS YOU KNOW THIS THIS LINGUISTIC WEB AND AND HIS YOU KNOW WR U AND WORKING IN LIKE JUST EXTENDED LONG SENTENCES AND THAT KIND OF THING ESPECIALLY IN THINGS LIKE A S THE SYSTEM BUT {it's / it is / it has} {there's / there is / there has} STILL A SENSE OF U EVEN THOUGH THE SURFACE YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} H {it's / it is / it has} HIGHLY ROTTEN RHETORICAL AND SUPERFICIAL {there's / there is / there has} STILL some how SOMETHING BEING REMEMBERED INTO THE YOU KNOW INTO THE PRESENT OF EXPERIENCING THAT TEXT AND AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU KIND OF THOUGHT ABOUT THE I MEAN ANYWAY I MEAN THIS IS WHAT YOU KNOW THAT WHAT I WAS THINKING OF ANYWAY IS IS LIKE THE WORK OF OF ASHBERY ESPECIALLY LIKE IN HIS LONGER MORE YOU KNOW MORE MEDITATIVE KIND OF WORKS I THINK IT WORKS WITH WITH THAT O'HARA YES LET ME SEE I do not KNOW BUT I THINK IN ACTUALLY IN BOTH CASES IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS THIS SENSE OF WALKING DOWN SECOND AVENUE LITERALLY WANTING TO RENDER THAT PRESENT TIME EXPERIENCE YES %bcack AND THE W ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS WITH THIS ENORMOUS BACKLOG OH AND THEN IT BECOMES ABOUT THAT AS WELL YEAH NOT TO BElabour A POINT BUT I THINK WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT DUNCAN'S WHAT IF DUNCAN AND O'HARA CROSSED PATHS IN TERMS OF SENSE OF IMMEDIACY OR SOMETHING I have not BEEN TO BE FAIR I MISSED IT I did not QUITE SAY MUCH {we had / we would} BE TALKING ABOUT HOW DUNCAN'S NOT SPEAKING FOR SOMETHING {that's / that is / that has} BEYOND THE SENSE RIGHT THIS IS THE PRESENT AS WELL OR I MISS SOMETHING THAT LITTLE THING WELL I WAS INTERPRETING THIS AS TRYING TO READ ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT THAT IS OF OH W HE WOULD USE THE VOCABULARY OF SAYING THAT IS I IN THE HEIGHTENED SENSE BECAUSE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT BUT IN OTHER WORDS {it's / it is / it has} NOT SOMETHING THAT IS REMOVED FROM ONE THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF SAY OF RELIGION WHICH IS A DOCTRINE WHICH YOU LEARN IN WHICH YOU ARE DISTANCED FROM GOD OR YOU ARE THAT AND YOU HAVE TO realise THAT SO {you are / you were} S SO {you are / you were} SAYING {it's / it is / it has} {it's / it is / it has} NOT LIKE THE PLATONIC READING IS NOT READING A BIT MORE THAN JUNK MEANING THE EXPERIENCE AS SOMETHING THAT AS A REFLECTION OF SOMETHING OUT THERE RATHER THAN THE IMPORTANT THING ITSELF SAY THAT AGAIN WOW NO THE YEAH I MEAN JUST I WAS i have BEEN THINKING ABOUT DUN OR i am THINKING ABOUT BOTH DUNCAN AND O'HARA IN TERMS OF DAMNED ENEMIES IN POETRY AND BEING VERY DIFFERENT I WAS INTERESTED IN THIS POINT OF INTERSECTION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THE i have DONE READINGS OF DUNCAN IN TERMS OF SORT OF PLATONIC WAY OF THE PART IN EXPERIENCE OR THE MATERIAL OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} ACTUALLY GOING ON IS NOT AS YOU SAID NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT WHAT IT SUGGESTS some timeS IN THE REALM AND THAT SOUL IS SORT OF NOT REALLY WORLD AND i am SO I WAS INTERESTED IN WHAT IF ANYTHING THE IDEA OF HUMAN EX {we are / we were} TALKING EXPERIENCE WELL THAT {it's / it is / it has} CONFUSING BECAUSE ONE does not KNOW WHAT TRANSCENDENT REALM OR what ever i have YEAH OR WHAT IT IS BECAUSE WHAT I THINK { he's / he was / he is / he has} TRYING TO DO IN THE HD BOOK IS TO SAY TO BRING IT BACK TO SOMETHING THAT WHERE THE ONE SELF OR ALL OBJECTS OR ALL BEINGS ARE ARE THE GERM OF WHAT LIFE IS AND THE FANTASY {that's / that is / that has} THE THE ESSENCE OR QUINTESSENCE OF THAT {it's / it is / it has} NOT ABSTRACT {that's / that is / that has} WHAT HE MEANS BY THE ACTUAL o. k. BUT THEN {that's / that is / that has} SO {that's / that is / that has} {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEING READ {that's / that is / that has} {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEING SEEN {it's / it is / it has} THE AND {that's / that is / that has} WHAT HE MEANS BY WORDS LIKE MAGIC OR WRITHE {it's / it is / it has} APPREHENDING THAT ASPECT OF SOMETHING IN THE ACTUAL BEING RATHER THAN REMOVING IT FROM {one's / one is / one was / one has} SELF AS A REFLECTION ON THAT AS IF IT WE AS I MORE RATHER THAN BEING DESCRIPTIVE {it's / it is / it has} EVOCATIVE IN TERMS OF WRITING BUT {that's / that is / that has} THE WHOLE THING I MEAN {it's / it is / it has} AND {it's / it is / it has} VERY DIFFICULT TO TO DESCRIBE THAT NO do not BE A BIG DUNCAN I do not THINK HIS HIS IMPULSE OR IN OR INTENT IS TO IS TO TRANSLATE THAT PARTICULARITIES OF

THE SIERRAS ABOUT ANKLE TINY SPARROW CHASES HUGE VULTURE HIGH OVER THE FREEWAY ZIGZAG PATH OUT BY THE WETLANDS A WALKWAY CONNECTS BUILDINGS OVER THE STREET WHICH FROM TWELVE STORIES UP I LOOK DOWN UPON OLD BRICK BUILDINGS OF LARIMER SQUARE ALL GOOGAWED UP BOUTIQUES FOR TOURISTS THAT STAY OPEN UNTIL NINE AT NIGHT WHAT IS MORNING FOR FORM SETS THE {reader's / reader is / reader has} EXPECTATIONS LAYING THE GROUND FOR A HAPPY OR UNHAPPY READING EXPERIENCE A SENTENCE LAID FORGOTTEN UNDER THE TREE BY THE RESERVOIR'S EDGE BURNED IN THE DARK THIS MORNING MY LIP IS BLISTERED WEIGHT BENDS THE

ONE BY ONE FUCHSIAS OPEN THEIR PALE PINK OUTER PETALS TURNED UP THAT WAS A DREAM THIS IS NOT i am NOT REALLY TRAVELING BY SUBMARINE TO A CONFERENCE IN EUROPE OF PAINT STORES i am TRYING TO IMAGINE

THE DAY IS WARM SALT RING STAIN CIRCLES THE SHIRT IN OUR PRIVATE LIFE THE OLD ACTRESS NOW SENILE WAS A SURREALIST WE PICK OUR WAY THROUGH THE COBWEBBED RESIDUE OF HER HOME SHOWER STEAM FOGS MY GLASSES LIFT THE DEAD TREE STUMP BACK INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK QUICKLY THE FIREWORKS SETTLE INTO A TERRIBLE SAMENESS THE WAY A SWARM OF CONNOTATIONS SETTLES IN ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT {it's / it is / it has} SUPPOSED TO MEAN IN THE DREAM WHERE DO I FIND IT BEING A VILLAGE EXPLAINER i am ALWAYS HAPPY TO COME UPON A VILLAGE {it's / it is / it has} AN OLD BUS THAT TRAVELLED BETWEEN THESE SMALL FARM TOWNS SO FAR APART THAT I DISEMBARK JUST TO RUN INTO THE STORE AND FETCH SOMETHING TO FIX THE ZIPPER ON THE SHOULDER BAG BUT ALL MY suit cases SLOW ME DOWN WHEN I GET BACK OUTSIDE {it's / it is / it has} LONG GONE ANOTHER NOT DUE FOR DAYS OFTEN THE DREAM DISSOLVES INSTANTLY AS I STUMBLE THROUGH THE ALARM CLOCK AND LIGHT SWITCH LEAVING BEHIND AS A RESIDUE AN EMOTIONAL TONE I WAS BEING THREATENED OR THERE WAS A PUZZLE TO SOLVE OR i have BEEN ABANDONED BY A BUS ONE DIFFERENCE WITH WAKING IS THAT IN DREAM I SEE CLEARLY SHARPLY i am NEVER WEARING GLASSES THE ONE WORD I REMEMBER IS CHADWICK {it's / it is /

WHICH CONTAINS THREE BAD GUYS UNCONSCIOUS CLAD ONLY IN THEIR SKIVVIES THEN I WAKE UP A ROY ORBISON SONG OBSESSIVELY IN MY HEAD BUT THE LINKAGES BETWEEN THEM OFFER NO SENSIBLE VERB SUPPRESS THE IMPULSE TO NAME THAT TUNE THE TWO OTHER PEOPLE TRAPPED IN THE ELEVATOR ARE A YOUNG MAN {who's / who is / who has} BEEN IN BED FOUR DAYS WITH THE FLU AND AN OLDER WOMAN {who's / who is / who has} A

LIGHT OCCURS OVER THE KIT OVER THE BATHROOM SINK AS ABSORBED REFRACTED SWELLING INTO THE EYE WIND BENDS THE BRAMBLES BETWEEN THE FENCE AND THE SHED A SOUND MORE LIKE SCRAPING THAN RUSTLING AS A TRAIN WHISTLE HOOTS SOMEWHERE TO THE WEST A SOLUTION THICK AS HONEY IS POURED INTO THE EYE THEN THE PLASTER CYLINDER INSERTED STANDING UPRIGHT IN HIS FACE with out ACTUALLY TOUCHING THE SURFACE A WOMAN I have not SEEN IN FIFTEEN YEARS AND have not THOUGHT OF IN TEN A MISSHAPEN THING WHO WROUGHT HAVOC IN OUR POLITICAL COLLECTIVE UNTIL WE EXPELLED HER with out I BELIEVE HER EVEN COMPREHENDING THAT {that's / that is / that has} WHAT we have DONE RETURNS IN THE DREAM AS OFFICIOUS AND ANXIOUS AS EVER LINGONBERRY CHEESECAKE RIGHT BEFORE BED ENHANCES THE EFFECT
Silliman-Ron_Complete-Recording_The-New-Sentence_SanFranArtInstitute_09-16-79 A a 0.192 394.049 FIVE MINOR SENTENCES CAN BE DIVIDED INTO THREE PRIMARY AND ONE SECONDARY TYPE ACCORDING TO CLAUSE STRUCTURE THESE ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY IMPORTANT FIVE POINT ONE SEQUENTIAL SENTENCES GENERATED FROM COMPOUND ONES THESE SENTENCES COMMONLY BEGIN WITH CONJUNCTIONS SUCH AS AND THEN WENT DOWN TO THE SHIPS MARGINAL SENTENCES GENERATED FROM COMPLEX ONES IN A TWO SEN IN THIS TWO SENTENCE PARAGRAPH FROM PLASMA THE SECOND SENTENCE IS OF THE MARGINAL TYPE THEY BLEW THE WHOLE THING UP AND WERE PRESENTED WITH A FRAGMENT AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE FIVE POINT THREE ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES GENERATED FROM SIMPLE ONES SUCH AS NEW MAYOR NO CONFLICTS N NON ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES WITH NO CLAUSE STRUCTURE SUCH AS YES NO OR REVOLVING DOOR THERE ALSO EXIST FOUR TYPES OF SITUATIONS IN TAGMEMIC ANALYSIS WHICH ALSO CALL WHICH ALSO GENERATE MINOR SENTENCE TYPES NOW WELL THE break down IN THE WORKS i have READ SEEM TO BE FAIRLY ARBITRARY AND IN NEED OF GREATER WORK THESE ARE ADDITIONS TO STATEMENTS RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS EXCLAMATIONS AND FINALLY VOCATIVES GREETINGS CALLS TITLES AND MOTTOES SUCH AS THE DODGE BOYS THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO SENTENCES INTEGRATE THE HIGHER ORDER UNITS OF MEANING THE OBVIOUS FIRST STEP PEERS TOWARDS THE PARAGRAPH AND HERE I WANT TO QUOTE VOLOSHINOV ONE LAST TIME IN CERTAIN CRUCIAL RESPECTS PARAGRAPHS ARE ANALOGUES TO EXCHANGES IN DIALOGUE THE PARAGRAPH IS SOMETHING LIKE A VITIATED DIALOGUE WORKED IN THE BODY OF A MONOLOGIC UTTERANCE BEHIND THE DEVICE OF PARTITIONING SPEECH INTO UNITS WHICH ARE TERMED PARAGRAPHS IN THEIR WRITTEN FORM LIE ORIENTATION TOWARD LISTENER OR READER IN CALCULATION OF THE LATTER'S POSSIBLE REACTIONS THE WEAKER THIS ORIENTATION AND CALCULATION ARE THE LESS organiseD AS REGARDS PARAGRAPHS OUR SPEECH WILL BE THIS CLASSIC TYPE OF PARAGRA TH THIS CLASSIC THESE CLASSIC TYPES OF PARAGRAPHS ARE QUESTION AND ANSWER WHERE THE QUESTION'S POSED AND ANSWER GIVEN BY THE SAME AUTHOR SUPPLEMENTATION ANTICIPATION OF POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS THE TYPE CITED IN WELLEK AND WARREN EXPOSITION OF SEEMING DISCREPANCIES OR ILLOGICALITIES IN {one's / one is / one was / one has} OWN ARGUMENT AND SO FORTH VERY OFTEN WE MAKE OUR OWN SPEECH OR PART OF IT THE OBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN SUCH A CASE A SHIFT OCCURS IN THE {speaker's / speaker is / speaker has} ATTENTION FROM THE REFERENT OF HIS SPEECH TO THE SPEECH ITSELF REFLECTION OVER {one's / one is / one was / one has} OWN WORDS BUT EVEN THIS SHIFT IN VERBAL INTENTION IS IN CONDITIONED BY THE ADDRESSEE'S INTEREST IF WE COULD IMAGINE SPEECH THAT ABSOLUTELY IGNORED THE ADDRESSEE AN IMPOSSIBLE KIND OF SPEECH OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE A CASE OF SPEECH WITH ORGANIC PARTITION REDUCED TO THE MINIMUM NEEDLESS TO SAY WE ARE NOT THINKING HERE OF CERTAIN SPECIAL TYPES OF PARTITION SHAPED BY THE PARTICULAR AIMS AND PURPOSES OF SPECIFIC IDEOLOGICAL FIELDS FOR INSTANCE THE STROPHIC PARTITION OF SPEECH AND VERSE OR THE PURELY LOGICAL PARTITION OF SPEECH OF T OF THE TIGHT PREMISED CONCLUSION THESIS ANTITHESIS AND THE LIKE BUT WE ARE OF COURSE THINKING OF EXACTLY SUCH THINGS HERE AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE THING THAT THE PARTITIONING OF PARAGRAPHS THE IDEA OF A PARAGRAPH AS A VITIATED DIALOGUE IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE STRATEGIES YOU SEE IN THE WORK OF DAVID BRONWICH'S ESSAY BONES MY POETRY AND OTHERS' AND DAVID ANTON WHEN HE GAVE A TALK OVER AT EIGHTIETH LANGDON STREET AND ACTUALLY DESCRIBED HIS OWN WORK IN EXACTLY OF VOLOSHINOV'S TERMS AS A VITIATED DIALOGUE ROSSI LANDI AN ITALIAN SEMIOTICIAN FOCUSES ON THAT PROBLEM A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY HE SUGGESTS THAT THE MODEL OF THE ABOVE SENTENCE INTEGRATION IS CLASSICALLY THE SYLLOGISM SUCH AS IN ALL WOMEN WERE ONCE GIRLS AND SOME WOMEN ARE LAWYERS SOME LAWYERS ARE WOMEN LOGICALLY THESE LEAD TO A THIRD SENTENCE OR CONCLUSION A HIGHER LEVEL OF MEANING SOME LAWYERS WERE ONCE GIRLS LITERATURE PROCEEDS BY ITS OPPRESSION MOST OFTEN OF THIS THIRD SENTENCE POSITING INSTEAD CHAINS ON THE ORDER OF THE FIRST TWO FOR EXAMPLE {here's / here is / here has} PLASMA AGAIN HE THOUGHT THEY WERE A FAMILY UNIT THERE WERE SEVEN MEN AND FOUR WOMEN AND THIRTEEN CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE WHICH VOICE WAS HE GOING TO RECORD BUT THIS INTEGRATION THIS ASSUMPTION THAT ALL THREE OF THESE INTERE THESE STATEMENTS ARE INTERRELATED AND IN FACT ONE RIG HIGHER ORDERS OF PRESUMPTION ABOUT IT IS IN FACT JUST A PRESUMPTION IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IN PLASMA WATTON PLAYS WITH THE {reader's / reader is / reader has} RECOGNITION OF THAT PRESUMPTIVENESS {that's / that is / that has} WHY WE TALK LANGUAGE BACK IN SOFALA i am WRITING THIS DOWN WALLOWING IN A SOFT LEATHER ARMCHAIR A DEAD DOG LIES IN A GUTTER HIS FEET IN THE AIR THAT THIRD SENTENCE HAS NOT MUCH TO DO WITH PREVIOUS TWO AND THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT S THIS IS WHY WE TALK LANGUAGE IS AGAIN THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU CAN ONLY INTEGRATE WITH THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE BY MAKING THAT WHAT I AM GOING TO CONTINUE CALLING A SYLLOGISTIC LEAP OR A SYLLOGISTIC MOVEMENT ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SENTENCE TWO PARAGRAPHS BEFORE THE SEPARATION OF THE SENTENCES IN PLASMA IS SO LARGE IT HAS TO SUPPRESS THE INTEGRATION OF SENTENCES ALL TOGETHER QUOTE THE BURDEN OF CLASSES IS A TWENTIETH CENTURY CAREER HE CAN BE INCREDIBLY CRUEL EVENTS ARE ADVANCING AT A TERRIFYING RATE ROSSI LANDI ALSO GIVES {us / u. s.} A FINAL MEANS OF LOOKING AT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF A SENTENCE IN HIS WORK LINGUISTICS AND ECONOMICS HE ARGUES THE HOMOLOGY THAT LANGUAGE USE ARISES FROM THE NEED TO DIVIDE THE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT THE ElabourATION OF LANGUAGE SYSTEMS AND labour PRODUCTION UP TO AND INCLUDING ALL SOCIAL PRODUCTION ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL IN THIS POINT OF VIEW A COMPLETED TOOL IS A SENTENCE A HAMMER FOR EXAMPLE CONSISTS OF A FACE A HANDLE AND A PLANE OR CLAW with out THE PRESENCE OF ALL THREE HAMMERS do not FUNCTION SENTENCES RELATE TO THEIR CLAUSES IN JUST THE SAME WAY WELL X RICHARD STEIN DISAGREED WITH THAT ALL ONLY THE MANUFACTURER OF HAMMERS WOULD HAVE ANY USE FOR DISCONNECTED HANDLES

HAVING A SCARY RELEVANCE TO THEIR LIVES KING RAIL THEY OFTEN LIVED ON AN ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC AND THEY OFTEN LIVED ON AN ISLAND IN THE ATLANTIC LAKE CHUBSUCKER THEY THOUGHT OF THESE TWO RESIDENCES OF

IT HAD ENDED THERE THE SOIL IN THIS AREA WAS ESPECIALLY RICH AS THE GLACIER PUSHED TOPSOIL BEFORE IT AS IT MOVED THEN DUMPED IT RIGHT WHERE THE TOWN WAS NOW LONGTAIL SALAMANDER FOR YEARS THEY HAD EATEN OFF THE WEALTH OF THE GLACIER AS THEIR FAMILY HAD LIVED IN THE HILLY SECTION OF TOWN AND HAD GROWN A VEGETABLE GARDEN IN THE back yard IN THE RICH TOPSOIL MARBLED SALAMANDER OR THEY LIKE TO

OVERDUE HE CLAIMED MOONEYE YET ACCORDING TO HIM THIS ICE AGE HAS BEEN PERHAPS COUNTERACTED BY HUMAN CLIMACTIC INTERFERENCE MOSSY VALVATA SO MAYBE WE WERE BETTER OFF MAYBE BETTER FIRE THAN ICE ALTHOUGH WHO KNEW WHAT GODS OR DEMONS WERE BEING ANGERED AND WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH THEIR ANGER MOTTLED DUSKYWING THEY WERE NOT SCIENTISTS AND COULD NOT FIGURE OUT W WHAT TO BLAME OR WHAT THE LONG TERM

THIS STORY SUCH AS BUSH WITH HIS REFUSAL TO SIGN THE KYOTO ACCORD AND CERTAIN INDUSTRIES NORTHEASTERN BEACH TIGER BEETLE BUT THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THE KYOTO ACCORD WAS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE NORTHERN CRICKET FROG THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY did not WANT TO LET EXCESSIVE INFORMATION PARALYZE THEM NORTHERN GOSHAWK OR EXCESSIVE GUILT NORTHERN HARRIER SO THEY FELT THEY HAD TO SAY THAT THEY AND THEY FELT THAT THEY HAD TO SAY THAT THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN PART RESPONSIBLE FOR IT what ever IT WAS THAT WAS CAUSING THIS BECAUSE THEY LIVED IN THE PLACE THAT USED THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF STUFF MOST LIKELY TO CAUSE THIS WARMING NORTHERN WILD MONK'S HOOD THEY LIVED AMONG THOSE WHO USED THE MOST STUFF UP WHO BURNED THE MOST STUFF WHO PRODUCED THE MOST STUFF AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT OLYMPIA MARBLE AND EVEN IF THEY TRIED TO LIVE THEIR LIVES WITH LESS STUFF THAN OTHERS THEY STILL benefited AND WERE A PART OF THE SYSTEM THAT PRODUCED ALL THIS STUFF AND BECAUSE OF THIS THEY HAD A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT
